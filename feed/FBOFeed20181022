<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Solicitation No. W911QY-18-R-0018. The US Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on behalf of Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM-FSS), located at the Natick Soldier Systems Center intends to issue a solicitation under Authority of FAR part 15, for Expeditionary TRICON Self-Service Laundry System (ETSSLS).<br />As part of the ETSSLS pre-solicitation notice the draft solicitation has been made available for industry comments and feedback. The draft solicitation is available for download on FBO.
<p>The United States Army is modernizing the laundry system associated with the Force Provider (FP) program. FP is a containerized system with the objective to provide a stand-alone base camp capability for a broad array of Combat Service Support and Homeland Defense missions. Force Provider was originally Type Classified Standard in May of 1994 as a 550-personnel module capable of being complexed/combined to support a brigade sized force of 3300 personnel. Recent configuration changes allow the new module to support 600 personnel per module via four expeditionary base camps supporting 150 personnel each. This configuration is referred to as Force Provider Expeditionary (FPE) Life Support Module (LSM). Each 150 personnel FPE LSM contains 1 - Expeditionary TRICON Self-Service Laundry System (ETSSLS).</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a Joint Services requirement for the ETSSLS associated with this solicitation in support of hospitals and other deployable base-camp systems. By introducing standardized assets to the Joint Services community, FPE LSM can improve its maintenance repair supportability. The commonality of repair parts can be used to assist other services in maintaining overall operational readiness.</p>
<p>The government anticipates the solicitation will result in the initial award of a single Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract consisting of a five (5) year ordering period for the production of the ETSSLS. An award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the government considering a tradeoff of price and non-price factors.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are encouraged to provide comments to the government on the "DRAFT Solicitation". Please submit any comments or questions to Schon Zwakman at schon.m.zwakman.civ@mail.mil with the subject line "Comments ETSSLS Draft Solicitation W911QY-18-R-0018". Questions may not be answered based on the "DRAFT Solicitation" and submitted comments.</p>
<p>The formal solicitation is expected to be released in August/September 2018. When released, the formal solicitation, including all amendments, exhibits and attachments, will be available in electronic medium via www.fbo.gov (TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED).</p>
<p>A question and answer period will be available when the formal solicitation is released. During that timeframe questions shall be submitted no later than the date specified in the solicitation. The government will provide its answers to the questions. The government will not guarantee a response to any question and/or clarifications after the submission deadline stated in the solicitation. All information regarding this requirement will be communicated via FBO (TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED).</p>

Phase:  Market Survey - Request for Information

Procurement Method: To Be Determined

1.	ANNOUNCEMENT

In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1, this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey- Request for Information (RFI) for the purpose of soliciting additional information relating to FAA Announcement No. 30407.  Interested parties which did not respond to Announcement No. 30407 may respond to this RFI provided all information requested in Announcement No. 30407 is provided. 

This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals and is not requesting pricing information at this time.  

2.	PURPOSE

This RFI is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the information Section 6 and 7 below from interested responders.
The acquisition strategy for the procurement has not been determined at this time; however, either a full and open competition or a set-aside will be chosen depending on the responses to the market survey. All businesses are encouraged to respond. 
 
3.	SMALL BUSINESS

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBAâs 8(a) Program.
The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is NAICS number 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services from Sector 54 -- Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. The size standard is $27.5 million. 
The FAA will consider information submitted in response to this RFI in determining the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.

The following is not required for interested parties which submitted this information in their response to Announcement No. 30407. The FAA requires copies of certification letters for interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBAâs 8(a) Program.  

4.	INTRODUCTION

The FAA is seeking interested vendors that are capable of providing replacement of the existing Automated Lightning Detection and Reporting System data dissemination service (ALDARS2).  The ALDARS2 effort is required to provide a new detected lightning data dissemination service for FAAâs Next Generation (NextGen) Weather systems and users. 

The intent of the attached documents and slides are to define what the NextGen Weather detected lightning data needs are and what the minimum requirements are for a replacement service. These documents are also intended to provide enough information for interested vendors to decide whether they may be capable of providing a replacement service that meets the NextGen Weather systemâs requirements. 

5.	BACKGROUND

CSS-Wx will replace the Automated Weather Observing Systems (AWOS) Data Acquisition System (ADAS), which is the current Consumer of the current ALDARS data service.

The current ALDARS contract Period of Performance (PoP) ends Close of Business September 24, 2019.  However, the Weather Program Office, AJM-333 needs to award a new ALDARS2 contract as soon as possible in order to have a lightning feed in place and tested in time for formal testing of the NextGen Weather Processor (NWP) Aviation Weather Display (AWD) at William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) in March 2019.

<DESC><p>The Netherlands Carillon tower is a 127' tall x 25' deep x 36' wide steel framed structure with steel panel cladding. The tower houses 50 bronze bells, and the total weight of the bells is over 30 tons. There is also a climate controlled room with a wooden console which allows carilloneurs to play the bells and perform public concerts. Built in 1960, the carillon was last renovated/repaired in 1994 through a cooperative agreement with the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce (the 1994 repairs were completed at no cost to the NPS).<br />The tower structure is showing severe signs of deterioration and the early stages of structural failure. This deterioration is accelerating at such an alarming rate that all public access to the tower structure area is closed. Access to the tower structure, tower stairs and platforms is currently restricted to official business only.<br />This project will rehabilitate the monument following the Secretary of Interior's Standards of Rehabilitation. The specific project scope is as follows:<br />&bull; Develop Construction Drawings<br />&bull; Coordination with the Netherlands Embassy's renovation scope<br />&bull; Develop and maintain a construction schedule<br />&bull; Develop and maintain a Health and Safety Plan<br />&bull; Develop and maintain a Quality Control Program<br />&bull; Tree and landscape protection, secure work area, and temporary facilities<br />&bull; Asbestos abatement<br />&bull; Rehabilitate the tower steel frame and cladding panels<br />&bull; Improve the tower drainage and ventilation<br />&bull; Replace the checkered plate floor decks<br />&bull; Rehabilitate the steel stairs and railings<br />&bull; Rehabilitate the clavier room and sound board roof<br />&bull; Replace existing mechanical and electrical systems<br />&bull; Rehabilitate the plaza pavers, perimeter wall, and bronze lion statues<br />&bull; Provide as-constructed drawings</p>

The project involves repairing/replacing IT Infrastructure equipment that will improve the IT infrastructure of the Lebanon Campus. Major elements of work include, but are not limited to: conducting a survey to identify areas that require fiber optic lines to be upgraded, expanding fiber optic capacity by installing additional lines, identifying dead cabling for demolition, expanding cabling capacity by installing additional conduit and cable trays, cooling for IT closets, upgrading and adding UPSs (Uninterruptible Power Supply), renovating the FITs (Facilities Information Technology System) building, Bldg 136, to improve area usage and a 1000 square foot addition to Bldg 136. Extra consideration may be given for experience designing projects for Department of Veterans Affairs Facilities.

NOTE:  Ensure that projects listed were completed by the firm as the prime contractor and not as a subcontractor or projects completed by key personnel while employed by another firm

Past performance on contracts with Government agencies (Particularly Department of Veterans Affairs) and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.
  
Note:  Project Past Performance information for projects performed shall be evaluated as either Relevant or Not Relevant.  Not Relevant projects shall not be evaluated. 

The following definitions apply:  

Relevant:  Past/Present performance efforts involve the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this contract requires.

Not Relevant:  Past/Present performance efforts involve none or significantly less magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this contract requires.

Currency:  For the purposes of this contract, currency is performance occurring within the last seven years from the posting of the contract synopsis.  Projects which are not current shall not be evaluated. 

Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time:  this factor evaluates the ability of the A-E firm to, given their current projected workload and the availability of their key personnel, to accomplish the project in the required time.

Location in the general geographic area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project:  This factor evaluates the distance from the A-E firms design office from the location of work (Lebanon VA Medical Center).  The personnel identified as the design team staff are expected to work in the design office identified for evaluation of this factor.  

NOTE:  Distance shall be measured from the Lebanon VA Medical Center, Lebanon, PA

Reputation and standing of the firm and its principle officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.

<p><br />DRAFT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT DATE: 18 September 2018</p>
<p>Nuclear Sciences Data Evaluation Services (NDES) III</p>
<p>Background: The 24th Analysis Squadron Nuclear Sciences Flight (24ANN), part of the Air Force Technical Application Center (AFTAC) 709th Surveillance and Analysis Group (709SAG), contracts with multiple laboratories to perform analysis of samples and uses the results to create reports. During previous contracts, mostly recently Nuclear Data Evaluation Services, NDES, a suite of software and hardware systems were developed to manage sample logistics and analytical information. The systems developed under previous NDES contract include the Trackman application, Data Acquisition System Lab Extraction (DASSLE), and Workflow. These items are described in more detail below as part of the overall 24ANN process.</p>
<p>The overall process begins when 24ANN receives a sample and creates a new project in the database using the Trackman tool. As 24ANN processes the sample they use Trackman as a virtual lab notebook and load basic sample processing information into the 24ANN database through Trackman. After samples are processed by AFTAC, they are sent to a network of contracted labs where samples are processed through multiple analytical techniques. The labs then load this information in the Data Acquisition System Lab Extraction (DASSLE) system. DASSLE transfers the data through a series of steps to a server at AFTAC where the information is stored on the 24ANN database. This database can be accessed by Workflow and Trackman for displaying and visualizing data. Evaluators use tools in both these programs to visualize data and write reports. Once a report is written and approved, the report is loaded into Trackman and the project is closed. The report and information associated with the report is part of a library which is searchable using Workflow and other tools. The report and other documents associated with the project are stored on shared drives managed by AFTAC.</p>
<p>The NDES system manages four (4) primary elements: DASSLE, Trackman, Workflow and the 24ANN database.</p>
<p>Element Description Associated Software &amp; Hardware<br />Trackman Interfacing tool to 24ANN database to record and view files and information associated with a sample Software (Visual Basic)<br />DASSLE System which transfers data from the labs to AFTAC's system Software (XML, JAVA, Oracle SOA Suite, Oracle Business Intelligence, Oracle Data Integrator, Oracle Web Portal, Oracle WebLogic, PLSQL), Solaris UNIX Servers<br />Workflow A report writing tool that displays and charts particle data Software (Java, PLSQL, XML, Fortran)<br />24ANN Database Database which stores 24ANN data Oracle 11g Enterprise Edition Release 11.2</p>
<p><br />Trackman: Trackman is 24ANN's software tool that interfaces users to the 24ANN's database and various directories. This allows users and data managers to save and access documents related to projects and some basic information from the database. The software acts as a virtual notebook, allowing users to track, put in sample descriptions and save photo documentation from sample processing.</p>
<p>DASSLE: DASSLE is a hardware and software system that allows 24ANN's contracted analysis labs to upload sample information from their labs to secure Government servers. Analysis data generated at the labs is loaded onto a secure webpage and converted to XML where it is submitted to an Oracle server. The data is then uploaded to another Oracle database through AFTAC specialized software. The data is then posted for use in the Workflow and Trackman tools.</p>
<p>Workflow: Workflow is a software interfacing tool that accesses 24ANN's database and allows users to view data, display data in various graphical forms and search the sample collection. Workflow provides graphical user interface to users for running nuclear reactor models and advanced algorithms in Java, C++ and FORTRAN.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPOSIS
<p>THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government currently intends to award a contract for MINICAMS maintenance and repair on an SOLE SOURCE basis, but is seeking vendors that may be able to perform this requirement in order to support a competitive procurement. Accordingly, the U.S. Government highly encourages all interested businesses (large and small) to respond to this sources sought synopsis. In addition, small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), must describe their identifying capabilities in meeting the requirements at a fair market price, i.e., information which may help support a set-aside.</p>
<p>The proposed sole source contract type will be determined after proper market research has been conducted to CMS Field Products for maintenance and repair of MINICAMs. The statutory authority for the sole source procurement is Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c ) (1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), supplies, services and/or equipment are available from one responsible source and no other type of supplies, services and/or equipment will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The NAICS code is: 811219, size $20.5M.</p>
<p>The US Army Dugway Proving Grounds (DPG) owns and operates 316 MINICAMS small footprint gas analyzers. This requirement is for offsite repair service to be executed at the contractor's location. Items requiring service will be shipped to contractor for diagnostics and repair. <br />MINICAMS is a fully automated, continuous, near-real-time air monitoring system. It was designed primarily for use in the U.S. Army's Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program as an automated chemical-vapor alarm system for monitoring of workplace air and other potentially contaminated in-plant zones, e.g., stack exhausts, ducts, filter banks, etc. It also works well for support of materials-penetration and permeation studies and many other laboratory or on-site test efforts involving a need to detect and quantify chemical vapors automatically and continuously. It provides audible, visible, and electrical alarm responses to toxic military chemical agent vapors, e.g., GB, VX, HD, etc., and to many other substances at any of a variety of regulatory threshold concentrations, e.g., TWA, MDL, PEL, etc. It also provides accurate vapor concentration readings at concentrations in the general vicinity of the preset alarm threshold. It was specifically designed to detect and accurately quantify the chemical agents and other volatile and semi-volatile compounds at far lower concentrations than most other chemical vapor monitors. MINICAMS is a readily transportable system that is designed to be set up and operated at fixed indoor locations or (under mild conditions) at sheltered outdoor monitoring stations, although instances of successful use in vehicles and other mobile platforms have occurred. It requires one or more compressed gases and a source of 117VAC electrical power for its operation.<br />MINICAMS is based on collection of airborne chemical vapors on a solid sorbent or in a sample loop, thermal desorption or flushing of the collected vapors into a gas chromatographic (GC) column, separation of the sample constituents on the column, and detection by a sensitive GC detector. The available GC detectors include both universal (i.e., nonselective) detector types that respond indiscriminately to virtually all substances, and selective detectors that respond primarily to certain restricted classes of chemicals. The instrument cycles repetitively through a Sample Period, during which an air sample is accumulated, and a subsequent Purge Period, during which the collected sample constituents are separated, detected, and quantified. Total instrument cycle times can range from about 5 min to 20 min or more. When a selective detector is installed, MINICAMS delivers accurate quantification and detection limits in the parts-per-billion and/or parts-per-quadrillion range as a matter of routine, although the system can be reconfigured or "detuned" to cover almost any desired concentration range above these levels.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.</p>
<p>Qualified companies are encouraged to respond. Responses should provide the following information in response to this sources sought announcement:</p>

<p>6. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.</p>
<p>7. Recommendations to improve the approach/specifications/draft PWS/PRS to acquiring the identified items/services. All potential offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), effective October, 30, 2018 to receive government contracts.</p>
<p>NOTE: In March 2018, the General Services Administration (GSA) implemented fraud prevention security measure in the System for Award Management (SAM) which required every notarized letter confirming the entity's Administrator that is authorized to register the entity in the SAM database, or to make changes to its registration. Effective 29 April 18, the notarized letter process is now mandatory on all Current registrants at SAM who have a requirement to update data on their SAM record. The notarized letter is mandatory and is required before the GSA Federal Service Desk (FSD) will activate the entity's registration. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and GSA realizes the length of time needed to transmit, receive, process, and approve the notarized letters presents a significant impact on the ability of the contracting activity to make timely awards, but in order to mitigate the concern of fraud, these steps and the time need for processing, is unavoidable. Coordinated pre-planning and communication can help minimize this impact. The notarized letters must be postal service mailed (not emailed or faxed) to the "Federal Service Desk" and must contain the information outlined in the SAM posted FAQ at: (https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/office-of-systems-management/integrated-award-environment-iae/sam-update</p>
<p>PROCEDURES: This Request for Information (RFI) is a required component of a complete and systematic process to evaluate interested parties in order to minimize cost both to potentially interested parties and the Government. Interested sources are also encouraged to submit product literature in response to this Request for Information (RFI). Any submission of such product literature or catalog cut sheets will be treated separate from, and will have no bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposal.</p>
<p>Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead (not to exceed 20 pages in length) to: U.S. Army Contracting Agency/Dugway, CCMI-CHD-DP, Attn: Mark S. Pratt, Contract Specialist, 5330 Valdez Circle, MS #1, Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway, Utah 84022-5000.

We are seeking information for market research purposes only.  The Government will not pay for any information solicited.
The VHA Network Contracting Office 6 (NCO 6) is conducting a market survey to find qualified vendors who can provide the following: 

GE MAC 5500 EKG Machine

EKG must include at least:
Ability to print EKGs immediately for interpretation 
Ability to communicate wirelessly to allow for the upload of the EKG to patient charting
Ability to scan patient wrist bands for input of identifying information
Ability to plug in to communication port for anytime that the wireless system may be down

      Delivery/Pickup:  Vendor is responsible for delivery to VAMC       

All responses shall be submitted no later than 10/31/18 12:00 pm est Noon 
All interested parties should respond, in writing via email to Fred.Bellamy@va.gov. 
No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  


In response, please include the following:  

Company/individual name
Address
Point of contact with phone number
Information describing your interest 
Indicate FSS/GSA contract number or Open Market, if applicable
Tax ID number
DUNS number
Capabilities Statement 
Company Socio-Economic SIZE (example large, small, SDVOSB, VOSB, WOSB etc.)
Proof of verification as a SDVOSB/VOSB (if applicable)

The Government anticipates this to be either a Services Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) set-aside.  If your firm/company is a SDVOSB or VOSB, the firm/company must be VERIFIED in the VIP database (see internet site: http://vip.vetbiz.gov) as prescribed under the Veterans First Contracting Program as implemented in VAAR subpart 819.70.  The Veteran Administration is mandated by Public Law 109-461 (38 USC Â§ 8127 & 8128) to give first priority to SDVOSB and VOSB concerns if there should be sufficient firms available to compete under a set aside.  If insufficient veteran owned small business responses are received to establish the basis for setting this action aside for other than large business participation, then the action will be advertised as a small business set aside or full and open competition. In this case, all interested parties responding shall be eligible to bid. 
The NAICS 339112- Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing is applicable to this acquisition; with a size standard of 1000 Employees. 
Interested firms are reminded that in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a) Prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications at the System for Award Management (SAM) as a part of required registration in conjunction with FAR 4.1102(a) that states, Prospective contractors shall be registered in the (SAM) database prior to award of a contract or agreement. Therefore, due to time constraints, vendors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) at http://www.sam.gov to be considered for an award.

<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) requires the head of each agency to conduct an annual evaluation of its internal controls and financial management systems. The requirements of FMFIA serve as an umbrella under which related management control assessments and reviews are coordinated and considered to support IHS management's annual assurances on the design and effectiveness of internal control. Multiple regulatory changes implementing OMB Circular A123 have led to a renewed call for delivering additional efficiency and value as part of the overall FMFIA implementation in IHS. More effective risk management integration with internal control assessment approaches have come to the forefront in many of these changes.</p>
<p>The OMB has continued to encourage Federal agencies to integrate assessment of programmatic controls with that of controls over financial reporting to improve efficiency and effectiveness and bring more value to achieving Agency's mission goals and objectives. Federal Agencies are expanding their control programs to integrate control objectives and assessment efforts as they are related to the requirements of OMB Circular A123 and related appendices, and OMB Circular (A-ll) - Incorporating Enterprise Risk Management in Federal budget, performance measures, financial management, and information and regulatory policies.</p>

<p>MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Crane, IN intends to award a sole-source contract to NAMMO RAUFOSS AS, Raufoss, Norway.  This effort will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the fuze design (MK444) used in the MK314 cartridge was exclusively developed by NAMMO and contains unique features that are required for use in the MK47 Advanced Lightweight Grenade Launcher (ALGL).  The  MK444 fuze was specifically designed for the MK47 ALGL which uses an AN/PWG-1 grenade launcher sight providing full weapon system capability.  The programming interface between the AN/PWG-1 sight and MK444 fuze is proprietary to NAMMO.  The full capability of the MK314 is only available when employed with the MK47 ALGL.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of testing, procurement, evaluation, and certification costs, which is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>

<DESC><div>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to conduct market research and to gauge potential interest in subcontracting opportunities for the support of the anticipated program in which DLA intends to contract on a sole source basis with The Boeing Company. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 336413, which has a corresponding size standard of 1000 employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an RFP or commitment by the Government.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>DLA Aviation at Philadelphia anticipates possible award of a contract with Boeing to execute a comprehensive and holistic performance based supply chain management program to support the P-8 aircraft.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The acquisition of performance-based support will be under the Boeing Captains of Industry (BCOI) contract, SPRPA1-14-D-200U. The contractor will be required to fill DoD and FMS customer requisitions for approximately 3,231 P-8 National Stock Numbers (NSNs). Approximately two/thirds are to be maintained under Performance Based criteria to include an availability metric/fill rate. Items not covered by the Performance Based metric will be handled as stock items with catalogue pricing and abbreviated lead times based on existing vendor agreements. The NSNs are comprised of consumable material.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The contractor will be required to meet supply chain performance based metrics for material availability.</div>
<div><br /></div>
Under the BCOI contract the contractor will provide following: logistics management, which Includes wholesale supply support, consumable support, material management, engineering support and sustainment elements, packaging, storage, reliability Improvements, and engineering support. The support includes spare parts/material support used in the maintenance activities at P8 DoD Operating Sites.<br />
<div>The contract is planned as a Fixed Price action against the BCOI contract, which is strategic in nature and will be the primary vehicle for procurement of the P8 support. The contractor will be required to deliver their supplies to Government wholesale and retail supply points within specified time windows.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The BCOl contract has a performance period of five (5) year base period with one five (5) year option to extend the contract for a total performance period of ten years.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Boeing will be using their commercial demand data to develop a forecast due to lack of military historical usage data. Provisioning has not been completed for this aircraft and changes are still being made to the design/configurations. Boeing will insure the parts delivered are the latest configuration using their technical knowledge as the aircraft manufacturer delivering production aircraft. DLA intends to award a follow-on contract to Boeing as an interim support strategy for commercial common consumables during early operations and while processing the provisioning information.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The long-term strategy is continuing to be developed as the aircraft is provisioned.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Any entity interested in providing some of the required products but cannot provide the required Performance Based outcome may be afforded an opportunity to partner with the prime contractor, Boeing, or participate as a subcontractor. Please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar support offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming arrangements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. Entities seeking to become an approved source of supply for any of the items covered by this notice should note that the time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.</div>
<div><br /></div>
Sources that are not approved for manufacture of these items must obtain source approval from the Government. Please note that if the evaluation of source approval requirements precludes the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on support needs.

Request for Information
 
Questions/Industry Input Needed 

This is a Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This request does not commit the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  VA is not currently seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that VA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.
 
Information 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information & Technology (OIT), utilizes a variety of contracts to acquire Rural Local Exchange Carrier (RLEC) services often provided by Telephone Co-operatives.  VA has recognized a need to reduce potentially duplicative, overlapping, and fragmented efforts.  VA intends to establish a consolidated RLEC management and services agreement.  This action aligns with Federal Government priority goals otherwise referred to as crosscutting goals as well as goals to improve management across the Federal Government.  VA is focused on implementing these objectives by means of OIT Enterprise level management of RLEC services.  OIT is tasked to accomplish the goal of reducing overall telecommunications and data expenses with minimal time of implementation as well as improvement in support, reporting, auditing and invoicing.

OIT has the overall business and management responsibilities for all VA telephone and data services.  OIT is currently responsible for the management of Information Technology (IT) operational expenses for VA Medical Centers (VAMC), Veteran Outreach Centers, Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) and other VA facilities throughout the United States (US) and the District of Columbia.as well as the US Territories of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, Samoa, Saipan, and the sovereign Republic of the Philippines.  OIT intends to consolidate telephone services to all facilities within the area of performance; centralize management of telephone services, and reduce expenses to service delivery points that are not available on existing VA OIT service agreements.

Goal 

VA anticipates changing the RLEC Services  current state which features multiple contracts managed at a local level requiring significant effort to fund, implement and manage to a consolidated contract.






The following goals are set for consolidation of LEC Services at the VA enterprise level:
 
Goal 
Expected Outcomes 
Impact 
RLEC Contract consolidation at the Enterprise Level 
Improved Government Productivity 
 
Elimination of multiple contracts across the VA 
Improved TPBO processes 
Simplified Contract Management 
 
Business Initiative Framework 

This project shall include RLEC Services at locations within the Enterprise.  The proposed action is to lower the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the Department s recurring telecommunications expenses for RLEC Services through merged contract management which will improve visibility into usage and spend patterns.

Mission Statement 

This acquisition shall transition RLEC Services for the VA to an optimized model.  The outcome shall address specific OIT requirements of effective and obtainable RLEC Services for VA Facilities.  The future state will result in a consolidated RLEC contract vehicle, economy of scale, and enterprise level management of services.
 
Business Context 

VA consists of approximately 807 CBOCs, 288 VA Vet Centers, 152 VA Hospitals, 131 National Cemeteries, and 56 Veterans Benefits Regional Offices.  Visit this link for detailed information: http://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/quickfacts/Homepage-slideshow.pdf.

VA OIT seeks to standardize across the enterprise in managing assets and expenses for telecommunications services.  A decentralized model of management has created an environment with lower capability to fund or an incapability to procure new requirements. 

VA is centralizing telecom contract management to an enterprise level Telecommunications Procurement Business Office (TPBO).  The TPBO is tasked to lower the TCO in telecommunications spending and reduce procurement times and maintenance of RLEC services through centralization.

Sponsor 

The OIT is the project sponsor. 

Charter 

VA Leadership has required consolidation of RLEC Services beginning in FY19. 



Stakeholders
 
The Chief Information Officer (CIO), OIT Area Managers, and rural field location staff.
   
In FY19, VA intends to consolidate all RLEC services contracts into one enterprise contract.  It is anticipated that this effort will provide improved management of such.

PWS 
Section/Paragraph reference 
Fully(F)/Partially (P) or Not (N) met 
change from 
change 
to 
comment/rationale  
 
 
 
 
 

Is the vendor s able to consolidate all the SDP s?   
What tasks are missing from the draft PWS that typically would be expected?  What modifications or additions to the requirements are recommended?  
What forward thinking considerations relative to technology, service, process, or management does the vendor commend to VA s attention?  Discuss any offerings you would recommend to VA. 
What is the vendor s upcharge for consolidation services? Will it vary by State, location, or Sub-Vendor?

What experience does the vendor have in re-selling RLEC Services? 
What is the vendor s approach to transition services from Telephone Cooperatives to a consolidated invoice?   
Will the vendor be able to report a detailed service record of services each month?

<CONTACT>Lee ALEXIS, Contract Specialist , Phone 4438614965, Email Lee.Alexis.civ@mail.mil - Brian Bosmans, Contracting Officer, Phone 4438614972, Email Brian.c.Bosmans.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><div>The Project Manager for Tactical Radios (PM TR) seeks industry interest regarding availability of representative multi-channel radios to meet Air to Ground (A2G) communications requirements supporting Army Aviation platforms (e.g., AH-64, UH-60, CH-47, MQ-1C). The goals of the A2G radio are to accomplish having unified secure network transport and to support aviation users in a deployed tactical force network.  Of interest are A2G radios currently under development by industry under Research and Development (RAD) efforts, or other efforts that can be quickly adapted to aviation use.  Product Manager for Hand-Held LINK-16, Air to Ground, Multi-role, MIDS, Radios (PdM HAMMR) is interested in responses for products that can be delivered in production quantities that satisfy functional and performance requirements.  Delivery of production representative radios at the earliest possible date is desirable.  If there are dependencies upon Government sponsorship to support certification activities, PdM HAMMR may consider requests for sponsorship independently from requests to provide Government funding.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The PdM HAMMR expects to conduct a Section 804 acquisition for rapid prototyping and initial production quantities, and anticipates release of a Statement of Intent no later than 1QFY20.  PdM HAMMR expects responses from vendors approximately 60 days later; and the government will review and select up to four (4) candidates for radio testing and evaluation.  It is expected the vendor will provide and support the radios at vendor expense.  Test setup and testing will commence 30 days after selection.  After testing, conducted over six (6) months after receipt of hardware, PdM will execute a down-select to one vendor.  Following a final single radio selection, PdM HAMMR requires production representative hardware delivery of up to 40 sets for qualification and verification testing. Additionally, we are expecting delivery of up to 125 sets to begin aviation platform integration efforts. <br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The Government will use responses to this RFI to refine requirements, therefore, we urge respondents not to self-eliminate if a requirement or some aspect of a requirement is not met; rather we encourage you to respond to the RFI with an explanation of why you think your offering is still acceptable (for example, a requirement is unnecessary or overly restrictive, drives cost or SWaP, will be met with growth, or other reasons). The requirements include but are not limited to the following: internal growth capability, modes/capability configuration/reconfiguration via software, multi-channel route and retransmit, waveform support, channel simultaneity, scalable networking, and Operational Availability.  Test activities will be determined before the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is released for consideration, but may include assessments of contractor laboratory facilities, on-site assessments of technical demonstrations (Waveforms, requirements, Manufacturing Readiness Levels), manpower, stress testing, size and power evaluation, interoperability with network management and key loaders, interoperability with other tactical radios and evaluation of technology readiness levels (TRLs).  The expected total quantity of radios to be procured has not yet been finalized due to Service budget and force priorities but is expected to be in excess of 2,500 radios.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not promise a statement of intent or constitute an RFP or a promise to issue either in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if issued.  If a Statement of Intent or RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</div>
<div><br /></div>
Description<br />
<div>The A2G multiple channel radio is a near term capability that will address multiple capability gaps within the Aviation community, the most significant being a data communications capability with ground forces.  This radio is intended as a multi-channel, software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 networking radio providing real-time communications in a dynamic combat environment.  The radio must be able to support the latest Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) waveform on one channel and the ability to host an Advanced Networking Waveform (ANWf) on the other channel(s), offering the users both a voice and data networking capability on Army Aviation platforms, and is backwards compatible with legacy SINCGARS (e.g. ARC-201D, RT-1523).  The Army is currently undergoing an architectural review and approval for the required ANWf(s) to reside on new procurement radios.</div>
<div><br /></div>
Requirements Overview<br />Multiple independent channels running independent waveforms, RF, audio/data and encryption, capable of simultaneous participation in both tactical voice and data networks providing line of site (LOS) airborne and air-to-ground communications<br />Priority waveforms:<br />a)	SINCGARS with cryptographic modernization<br />b)	Advanced Networking Waveform (ANWf)<br />Multiple independent levels of security:<br />a)	Type 1 and Type 2 encryption<br />b)	SBU/CUI and SECRET<br />c)	Capable of Plain text (voice only)<br />Radio Frequency Bands:<br />a)	VHF and UHF 30-88 MHz and 112-225 MHz for narrowband waveforms<br />b)	One channel dedicated to military UHF (&lt;1250 MHz), L-Band (1250 - 2000 MHz), and S-Band (2000-2600 MHz) for narrowband and wideband waveforms <br />c)	Ideal channel operation will accept any waveform operating from 30-2600MHz with limitations imparted only by physical limitations of the Radio Frequency Distribution chain (cabling, filters, amplifiers, antennas etc)<br />Certifications and Accreditations:<br />a)	Waveform Software Conformance Testing/Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) Certification<br />b)	National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 Certification<br />c)	Risk Management Framework (RMF) Certification and Accreditations (for the A2G vendor provided components (e.g. radio, power amp))<br />d)	Airworthiness Certification<br />
<div><br /></div>
<div>Additional Security Criteria:  System designs which employ software configurable cryptographic engines and is capable of hosting software-defined Cryptographic Equipment Algorithms (CEA) and networking waveform Communications Security (COMSEC)/ Transmission Security (TRANSEC) algorithms are more desirable.  Embedded cryptographic capability should not be a limiting factor.  It is desired that the A2G be capable of certified operation with different classification levels assigned to each channel.    Key loading capability must include current force devices such as the Simple Key Loader (SKL) and Over-the-air-rekey.  Components capable of being handled and transported as unclassified Controlled Cryptographic Items (CCI) will receive preference as these will facilitate supportability within the current logistical infrastructure.  Proposed solutions must have a cryptographic architecture compliant with NSA Management Directive 237 Number 10 (MD-10).</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Integration Requirements.  A2G solutions must meet platform integration characteristics of currently fielded radio systems including physical attributes, reliability and durability, performance and features of current capabilities, interfaces, and be able to maintain high-performance capabilities while exposed to environmental extremes.  Additional capabilities driven by the networking waveforms include extensive Internet Protocol (IP) networking features, robust Information Assurance (IA) including platform network authentication and security, software upgradability in the field, and interoperability with all other networking waveform radios being fielded by the DoD.</div>
a)	Capability Integration.  Capability Integration.  Respondents should present innovative solutions such as utilization of a family/combination of radios instead of using a single product to achieve necessary capabilities; and to meet all requirements and platform types (e.g. a separate radio may be able to host Link 16, Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)).  Respondents are invited to present innovative solutions.<br />b)	SINCGARS/Networking Waveform Objective Configuration:  Due to platform installation and space constraints on manned and unmanned aircraft, A2G will replace existing radio systems to add new networking capabilities.  Replacement systems must have all of the capabilities of radio(s) they replace.  Configuration flexibility is key.  For example one channel of the A2G Set (including power amplifier) could be configured for SINCGARS with the second channel (including power amplifier) configured to support multiple waveforms.  To retain maximum flexibility for other applications, it is desirable that each channel of the A2G is capable of being configured for any supported waveform.  The SINCGARS waveform is expected to provide all legacy modes, features, performance and services of the existing ARC-201D (exceptions may be taken for packet, and serial data rates 600bps and below).<br />c)	Physical Installation Constraints.  Installation dimensions of the multi-channel A2G must be nearly identical to those of currently deployed radio sets such as the RT-1478D(C)/ARC-201D(V) and ARC-231.  Example installations could comprise a two-channel A2G set that would fit within the installation space currently occupied by a RT-1478D(C)/ARC-201D(V) radio and two channels of power amplification that would fit within the SINCGARS AM-7189A/ARC existing power amplifier location.<br />d)	Environmental, including Shock, Vibration, and Gunfire.  Relevant performance capabilities across the envelope of Army Aviation platform environmental conditions are specified in MIL-STD-810G and AVNS-PRF-10758.<br />e)	Electromagnetic Interference (EMI).  When transmitting, the A2G Set must have control features which can be used to prevent its emissions from degrading the performance of other Radio Frequency (RF) systems on the platform.  Applicable EMI requirements are described in MIL-STD-461F, as modified by ADS-37A-PRF.<br />f)	Platform Power.  Due to the scope of platforms requiring this radio, it is desired that the A2G set with required ancillary devices be capable of meeting the worst-case full performance requirements over the normal operation power characteristics described in MIL-STD-704 inclusive of versions A through F and maintaining operability under all specified abnormal operation power conditions.  Use MIL-HDBK-704-8 (28 VDC sections) as a test guide.<br />
<div><br /></div>
<div>Reliability.  A2G set reliability requirements are identified in terms of channel hardware mean time between failure (MTBF) and channel software MTBF.  It is desired that the A2G set has demonstrated quantifiable reliability via formal reliability testing and in field use.  It is also desired that the quantified A2G set reliability be translated to hardware and software channel MTBF values.</div>

<CONTACT>Richard Totten, Contract Specialist, Phone 3016192446, Email richard.w.totten2.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB), an agency of the Department of<br />Defense (DoD), is soliciting pre-proposals for original and innovative research designed to develop new interventions for protection of deployed military personnel from diseases caused by arthropod-borne pathogens and to improve control of bed bugs and filth flies. Diseases of significant concern include Lyme disease, malaria, dengue fever and other arboviruses. The program supports development of: (1) new toxicants or the adaptation of existing toxicants to medically relevant vectors; (2) new insecticide application techniques; and (3) new personal protection tools that prevent human-vector contact. Ideally the research would support the Advanced Technology Development (i.e.(i.e. DoD RDT&amp;E "Budget Activity 3" in the DoD Financial Management Regulation Volume 2B, Chapter 5) of new insecticides, or improved<br />formulations of existing insecticides for vector control, new technology or enhanced modalities of personal protection from biting arthropods, or would improve the efficacy and sustainability of equipment for application of pesticides for vector control in a military operational environment. Research should be product-oriented, consisting of advanced research related to a particular technology or new capability, evaluation of experimental products for military uses, or research directed towards development of an existing prototype product for commercial manufacture. Research should include semi-field or field evaluation of prototype products. The research must be primarily applicable to the military, products should be transferable to civilian uses. The program consists of competitive grants open to principal investigators (PI) from academia, industry, and local or state government agencies.

<RESPDATE>110618
<CONTACT>Mallory C. Person, Contract Specialist, Phone 7035885833, Email mallory.c.person.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE<br />Subject: Deployed Tele-Radiology System (DTRS) Sustainment<br />The Defense Health Agency (DHA), Contracting Office Defense Healthcare Management Systems (CO-DHMS), on behalf of the Joint Operational Medicine Information Systems (JOMIS), Program Management Office (PMO), intends to issue a sole source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)/ firm fixed price (FFP) contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. If the Government proceeds with the intended action, written solicitation HT0038-18-R-0002 will be issued to:
<p>Nexsys Electronics, Inc., dba Medweb<br />70 Zoe Street, Suite 100<br />San Francisco, CA 94107</p>
<p>The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541511, (size standard $27.5 million).</p>
<p>This requirement will sustain the Deployed Tele-Radiology System (DTRS) that provides in-theater users with deployed imaging capability. This capability improves the quality, timeliness, and availability of stored images to medical treatment decision makers and facilities when patients require follow-up treatment.</p>
<p>The services under this requirement are currently under contract HT0011-13-F-0052, which resulted from full and open competition. The DTRS serves as the local Picture Archiving Communications System (PACS) providing tele-radiology services to deployed forces in the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility. The servers combine the functions of a PACS archive, Digital Imaging Communication in Medicine (DICOM) web server, telemedicine web server, Ethernet Proxy gateway, Virtual Private Network encryption router, and satellite enhanced DICOM internet tunnel. The DTRS servers receive, store, and transmit medical images acquired from diagnostic imaging devices (e.g., Computed Radiography x-ray, Computed Tomography, and ultrasound). Diagnostic workstations running the Medweb client application provide the presentation and manipulation of DTRS PACS images. HT0011-13-F-0052 expires on 23 DEC 2018.</p>
<p>DTRS is not being replaced by JOMIS Increment 1, but modernization or replacement of DTRS will be considered in future JOMIS increments.</p>
<p>Until such time as DTRS is modernized or replaced, the Government is procuring the services required to sustain the deployed capability are highly complex due to the engineering dependencies on other in-theater systems, cybersecurity requirements in a warfighting environment, and the criticality of the capability to three major theater hospitals. <br />Further, replacing this follow-on action with new PACS and DICOM capabilities would result in substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirement.</p>
<p>Notably, a new system would have to be configured and integrated (or developed), new interfaces to other external systems would need to be implemented, cybersecurity hardening and accreditation would be required, and the fully configured system would require testing and validation prior to being deployed and connected. Once these activities were complete, the system would need to be deployed throughout the CENTCOM AOR, existing imaging data would need to be migrated, and end users would need to be re-trained on how to operate the new system. Each of these steps would require significantly more time than sustaining the already deployed system and would result in considerable duplication of effort as each of these actions has already been completed for DTRS.</p>
<p>Further, during the initial acquisition of the system, the Government did not obtain sufficient data rights or technical data packages to allow for the extraction of data in a useable format from DTRS and a migration to any new system would require that system to be compatible with the DTRS architecture, the description of which is proprietary to Medweb. In order to enable this migration, the Government would need to enter negotiations with Medweb to obtain the appropriate rights, which would require additional time and cost, and no resulting agreement is assured or certain.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Government deemed the highly specialized services to be available only from the original source for this follow-on action.</p>
<p>Be advised that the aforementioned information is anticipatory in nature and is not binding. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm believing that they can fulfill the requirement of providing these services may be considered by the Agency. Interested parties shall identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis within 15 calendar days of publication, and must clearly demonstrate their ability to successfully fulfill all of the above requirements without substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delay.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right not to respond to any expressions of interest received. Any comments, questions, or concerns regarding this notice may be submitted IN WRITING via e-mail to Mallory Person, Contract Specialist at Mallory.c.person.civ@mail.mil. No telephone responses will be accepted.</p>
<p>Submissions will NOT be reimbursed by the Government and the entire cost of any submission will be at the sole expense of the source submitting the information. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This synopsis is for informational purposes only. Any Justification &amp; Approval resulting from a decision to award the proposed sole source action will be posted on this website.</p>

The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Submissions will not be returned nor will the Government confirm receipt of submissions.</p>
<p>In addition, respondents should be aware that the JOMIS Program Office may utilize contractor support personnel from the below listed companies (under existing contracts) to review responses and information submitted. These companies and individual employees are bound contractually by Organizational Conflict of Interest and disclosure clauses with respect to proprietary information, and they will take all reasonable action necessary to preclude unauthorized use or disclosure of a respondent's proprietary data.

<p>52.212-2 Addenda:</p>
<p>Basis for Award<br />The Government plans to award a purchase order (or call order if a Blanket Purchase Agreement is available) as a result of this Request for Quotation (RFQ). The evaluation of quotes shall be conducted utilizing the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) evaluation approach, based on an evaluation of quotes in the areas of Technical and Price Under this evaluation approach, a quote would not receive any additional credit for exceeding the established minimum defined requirements of technical acceptability.<br />Discussions: The Government intends to evaluate quotes and make an award decision without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the initial quote should contain the offeror's best terms. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer determines them to be necessary.<br />Evaluation Factors:<br />(1) Technical<br />(2) Price<br />Evaluation Approach<br />Careful, complete and impartial consideration will be given to all quotes received pursuant to this RFQ. A team of Government personnel will evaluate each quote in the areas described below.<br />1) Technical: The technical portion of the quote will be rated Acceptable or Unacceptable based on the assessment of the stated minimum requirements. In order for a quote to be rated Acceptable, Offerors are required to provide a brief (no more than 10 pages) capability statement clearly describing the Offeror's equipment/facilities, quality assurance practices, any additional process capabilities, and how they will be used to satisfy the delivery of the assemblies as described in the SOW. All items listed in the attached SOW Appendix A shall be delivered NLT ten (10) weeks after receipt of order.</p>
<p>Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal meets the requirements of the solicitation<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not meet the requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>2) Price will NOT receive a rating. The quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>
<p>The total evaluated price is the total price proposed for this order. Offerors shall propose prices for each item in Appendix A as a total overall price (i.e., Line 001 Angle should be one price for all 500 items to be finished according to the Appendix). All pricing shall be submitted on an Excel spreadsheet (with formulae intact) and submitted with a total price calculated.<br />Price Inconsistencies: A quote is presumed to represent an offeror's best effort to respond to the solicitation. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performance and price, shall be explained in the quote. Any significant inconsistencies, if unexplained, raise a fundamental issue of the offeror's understanding of the nature and scope or the work required and their financial ability to perform the contract, and may be grounds for rejection of the quote</p>
<p>Please complete provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications- Commercial Items; OR indicate that your company's representation's and certifications are current and available via Sam.gov.

<p>Complexity<br />The programs implemented by INL are generally highly complex multi-year development and capacity-building programs. The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.</p>
<p>Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1:	Program Management				(25 points)<br />Demonstrated experience in providing contractor oversight on high dollar contracts, ensuring contractor requirements are being fulfilled per the Statement of Work and other deliverables; evaluating and documenting contractor performance, especially through a well-developed Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).</p>
<p>FACTOR 2:	Federal Acquisition					(25 points)<br />Demonstrated comprehensive understanding of contract administration principles, policies, regulations and procedures, including U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).</p>
<p>FACTOR 3:	Department of State					(25 points)<br />Demonstrated knowledge of government programs and experience working on international programs or projects.</p>
<p>FACTOR 4:	Past Performance 					(25 points)<br />Past performance evaluation of applicant's ability to perform under a contract.  In conducting the evaluation, the Government reserves the right to utilize all evaluation information available at the time of evaluation, whether provided by the applicant or obtained from other sources.</p>
<p>The most qualified candidates may be interviewed, required to provide a writing sample, and demonstrate an ability to operate commonly used office applications. INL will not pay for any expenses associated with the interviews. In addition, applications (written materials and interviews) will be evaluated based on content as well as on the applicant's writing, presentation, and communication skills. In the event that a candidate has fully demonstrated his/her qualifications and there are no other competitive applicants, INL reserves the right to forego the interview process. Professional references and academic credentials will be evaluated for applicants being considered for selection.</p>
<p>COMPENSATION (BASE PAY)<br />For award, INL will negotiate for this contract based on the market value as outlined above and overall experience relevant to the solicitation requirements.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Prefilled IV Flush Syringes. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Prefilled IV Flush Syringes products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at <a href="https://www.medical.dla.mil">https://www.medical.dla.mil</a>. <br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Prefilled IV Flush Syringes in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Prefilled IV Flush Syringes will be established approximately February 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately March 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Prefilled IV Flush Syringes. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Prefilled IV Flush Syringes.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Prefilled IV Flush Syringes. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,813,266. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Five items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 95.9% ($1,738,611) of the total volume in sales ($1,813,266). The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Logistics Directorate has a requirement to procure a secure lockbox system to securely store entry door keys for Manufactured Housing Units during the installation and maintenance phase. The lockboxes are to be mounted in a tamper resistant container securely attached to the Transportable Temporary Housing Units (TTHU) and equipped with Bluetooth technology allowing the user to open the box by entering a secure code using a smartphone application. Access to the lockbox activity database is to be available to government for the purpose of creating custom reports.
<p>The lockboxes will be used to control, monitor and report all access to the TTHUs to provide improved security and accountability for the units, occupants, and field personnel. FEMA anticipates that the result of using this access control system will lead to better security and accountability for TTHUs, and personnel involved in unit installation and maintenance.</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of this requirement is to establish a Firm-Fixed Price purchase order to provide lockboxes that will secure access control of manufactured homes and other TTHUs during the installation and maintenance phase.</p>

<p>Proposal is due on <strong>October 25, 2018 @10:00pm CDT/CST</strong>. Submit proposal to:<br />Great Plains Area Indian Health Service<br />Attn: Connie Valandra, Contract Specialist<br />Federal Building, Room 309<br />115 4th Avenue Southeast<br />Aberdeen, South Dakota 57401-4360<br />Telephone: 605/226-7567<br />Facsimile: 605/226-7669<br />E-mail: connie.valandra@ihs.gov</p>
<p>Note to the Proposed Contractor:<br /><strong>Security Clearance<br /></strong>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the IHS (Indian Health Service). Before starting work requiring routine access to IHS facilities or systems each person must complete an FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an IHS employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for IHS processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an IHS site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of IHS sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The IHS utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the eQIP entry to the OPM (Office of Personnel Management) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the Service Unit for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>OIG Exclusion List</strong> <br />No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>

<p>NAM 1330-52.222-70 NOAA SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE POLICY (MAY 2018)<br /><br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.</p>
<p>(a) Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members. <br />Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim. <br />Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true: <br />&bull; Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment; <br />&bull; Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; <br />&bull; The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. <br />The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.</p>
<p>(b) Requirements.</p>
<p>1. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment. 2. The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor. 3. If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6, .07, Reporting from Remote Locations. i. Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed. ii. The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4. The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within ____ business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable. Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion. Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.</p>
<p>i. The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace</p>
<p>Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.</p>
<p>ii. The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically.

<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>

<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.<br /><br />(End of Clause)</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products. <br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________ ___________________<br />___________________ ___________________<br />(2) Certification.

(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, Compliance with the Laws (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:</p>
<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

<p>NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>Contractor Access to NOAA Facilities (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The performance of this contract requires employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members ("contractor employees") to have access to and to the extent authorized, mobility within, a NOAA facility.</p>
<p>(2) NOAA may close and or otherwise deny contractor employees access to a NOAA facility for a portion of a business day or longer for various reasons including, but not limited, to the following events:</p>
<p>(i)	Federal public holidays for federal employees in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6103;</p>
<p>(ii)	Fires, floods, earthquakes, and unusually severe weather, including but not limited to snow storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes;</p>
<p>(iii)	Occupational safety or health hazards;</p>
<p>(iv)	Lapse in Appropriations; or</p>
<p>(v)	Federal Statute, Executive Order, Presidential Proclamation, or any other unforeseen reason.</p>
<p>(3) In such events, the contractor employees may be denied access to a NOAA facility that is ordinarily available for the contractor to perform work or make delivery, as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(b)	In all instances where contractors are denied access or required to vacate a NOAA facility, in part or in whole, the contractor shall be responsible to ensure contractor personnel working under the contract comply.  If the circumstances permit, the contracting officer will provide direction to the contractor, either directly or through the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), which could include continuing on-site performance during the NOAA facility closure period; however, if Government oversight is required and is not available, on-site performance shall not be allowed. In the absence of such direction, the contractor shall exercise sound judgment to minimize unnecessary contract costs and performance impacts, for example, performing required work off-site if possible or reassigning personnel to other activities if appropriate.</p>
<p>(c)	The contractor shall be responsible for monitoring the Office of Personnel Management at www.opm.gov, the local radio, television stations, NOAA web sites, and other communication channels.  Once the facility is accessible, the contractor shall resume contract performance as required by the contract.</p>
<p>(d)	For the period that NOAA facilities were not accessible to contractors who required access in order to perform the services, the contracting officer may-</p>
<p>(1)	Adjust the contract performance or delivery schedule for a period equivalent to the period the NOAA facility was not accessible;</p>
<p>(2)	Forego the work; or</p>
<p>(3)	Reschedule the work by mutual agreement of the parties.</p>
<p>(e)	Notification procedures of a NOAA facility closure, including contractor denial of access, are as follows:<br />(1)	The contractor shall be responsible for notification of its employees of the NOAA facility closure to include denial of access to the NOAA facility.  The dismissal of NOAA employees in accordance with statute and regulations providing for such dismissals shall not, in itself, equate to a NOAA facility closure in which contractors are denied access.  Moreover, the leave status of NOAA employees shall not be conveyed or imputed to contractor personnel.  Accordingly, unless a NOAA facility is closed and the contractor is denied access to the facility, the contractor shall continue performance in accordance with the contract.</p>
<p>(2)	Access to Government facilities and resources, including equipment and systems, will be limited and personnel necessary to administer contract performance may not be available. Generally, supply and service contracts that are funded beyond the date of the lapse in appropriation and do not require access to Government facilities, active administration by Government personnel or the use of government resources in a manner that would cause the government to incur additional obligations during the lapse in appropriation may continue.  If a delivery date for a contract falls during the period of a lapse in appropriations, Government personnel may not be available to receive delivery.  Contractors are directed to consult with a contracting officer before attempting to make a delivery.  Contracting officers will be available throughout the lapse in appropriation period to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Once OMB guidance is given, CORs, in consultation with the contracting officer, will notify those contractors that are deemed by the Program Office to be performing excepted work and identify the contractor personnel requiring access to NOAA facilities.  CORs will also coordinate with directly with facility management or physical security personnel at respective locations to ensure that the names of contractor personnel requiring access to government facilities during the lapse in appropriations are provided to physical security personnel.</p>
<p>Contractors who are not designated as performing excepted work are not allowed access to Government facilities or to utilize government resources in a manner that would incur any additional obligation of funding on behalf of the government during the lapse in appropriation.</p>
<p>(3) Unless otherwise specified within the contract award, contractors requiring access to NOAA facilities outside normal business hours or outside the normal workweek shall submit a written request in writing through the COR to the contracting officer.  The written request shall provide justification supporting the required access and be submitted 72 hours/days (contracting officer insert number of days. <br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Government-Contractor Relations - Non-Personal Services Contract (SEPT 2017)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>
<p>(2)	Be placed in a position of command, supervision, administration, or control over Government personnel or over personnel of other Contractors performing under other NOAA contracts.</p>
<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>
<p>(e)	Both parties are responsible for monitoring contract activities for indications of improper employee-employer relationships during performance.  In the event a situation or occurrence takes place inconsistent with this contract language, the following applies:</p>
<p>(1)	The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing within 5 business days from the date of any situation or occurrence where the Contractor considers specific contract activity to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language.  The notice must include the date, nature and circumstance of the situation or occurrence, the name, function and activity of each Government employee or Contractor employee involved or knowledgeable about the situation or occurrence, provide any documents or the substance of any oral communications related to the activity, and an estimated date by which the Government is recommended to respond to the notice in order to minimize cost, delay, or disruption of performance.</p>
<p>(2)	The Contracting Officer will review the information provided by the Contractor, obtain additional information (if needed), and respond in writing as soon as practicable after receipt of the notification from the Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's response will provide a decision on whether the Contracting Officer determines the situation or occurrence to be inconsistent with the intent of this contract language and, if deemed necessary, will specify any corrective action(s) to be taken in order to resolve the issue.<br /> (End of Solicitation and Contract Language)</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>1330-52.222-70 NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy (MAY 2018)<br />In accordance with NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-1106, NOAA Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Prevention and Response Policy, it is the policy of NOAA to maintain a work environment free from sexual assault and sexual harassment. NOAA prohibits sexual assault and sexual harassment by or of any employee, supervisor, manager, contractor, vendor, affiliate, or other individual with whom NOAA employees come into contact by the virtue of their work for NOAA.</p>
<p>(a)	Definitions.</p>
<p>Contractor Employees - The term "contractor employees," as used in this solicitation and contract language, refers to employees of the prime contractor or its subcontractors, affiliates, consultants, or team members.</p>
<p>Sexual Assault - The term sexual assault, as used in this solicitation and contract language, means any conduct proscribed by state or federal sexual abuse laws, including, but not limited to, those defined in chapter 109A of title 18 of the U.S. Code (sexual abuse), and assaults committed both by offenders who are strangers to the victim and by offenders who are known or related by blood or marriage to the victim.</p>
<p>Sexual Harassment - As defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature when any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&bull;	Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly as a term or condition of an individual's employment;<br />&bull;	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual;<br />&bull;	The conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.</p>
<p>The main characteristics of sexual harassment are that the harasser's conduct is targeted against the recipient's sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and is unwelcome to the recipient. It may include, but is not limited to: offensive jokes, slurs, epithets or name calling, undue attention, physical assaults or threats, unwelcome touching or contact, intimidation, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, constant or unwelcome questions about an individual's identity, and offensive objects or pictures.<br />(b)	Requirements.</p>
<p>1.	It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that contractor employees maintain the highest degree of conduct and standards in performance of the contract. In support of this, NOAA urges its contractors to develop and enforce comprehensive company policy addressing sexual assault and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>2.	The contractor shall include wording substantially the same as this solicitation and contract language in every subcontract so that it is binding upon each subcontractor.</p>
<p>3.	If a contractor employee observes or is the object of sexual assault or sexual harassment, he or she is highly encouraged to report the matter, as soon as possible, to their immediate supervisor, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), subset of the COR (e.g. Task Manager or Assistant COR), or contracting officer (CO) if a COR is not assigned to the contract. The contract employee may also contact the NOAA Civil Rights Office to obtain guidance on reporting instances of sexual assault or sexual harassment. If deemed necessary, the contractor employee may also report such instances to local law enforcement. In the case where the incident occurs while performing at a remote location, such as at sea or in the field (at a field camp or other isolated location) where the above referenced individuals are unavailable, the contractor employee should follow the reporting procedure set forth in NAO 202-1106, Section 6,.07, Reporting from Remote Locations.</p>
<p>i.	Swift reporting allows NOAA and the contractor to take the appropriate measures to ensure that offensive behavior stops and the complainants' needs are addressed.<br />ii.	The COR (if assigned), CO, and contractor, where applicable, will work together to ensure appropriate action is taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contract terms and conditions, and the contractor's written policy (where applicable).</p>
<p>4.	The contractor shall provide all contractor employees assigned to perform under this contract with mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment prevention and response training in compliance with the requirements of NAO 202-1106, Section 5, Prevention Training and Awareness, as part of their initial in-processing and on an annual basis thereafter. The initial training shall be completed within          business days [30 unless a different number is inserted] of contract award or the date a contractor employee is assigned to perform under the contract, as applicable.</p>
<p>Evidence of initial training by name and date completed for each contractor employee, shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) within 10 business days of completion.</p>
<p>Evidence of annual training by name and date completed for each contractor employee shall be submitted to the COR or contracting officer (if no COR assigned) no later than March 1st of each calendar year of contract performance.</p>
<p>i.	The mandatory sexual assault and sexual harassment training provided by the contractor shall include the required elements set forth by NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager. A link to the website including the required elements of the training is provided at: http://www.ago.noaa.gov/quicklinks/harassment_training.html. The website will also provide training materials and resources to assist the contractor in conducting the training. The contractor may provide training that solely addresses the NOAA required elements or may supplement existing company sexual assault and sexual harassment training in a manner that ensures all of the elements are adequately addressed.<br />ii.	The required elements of the training and resources available to the contractor for the training may be updated by NOAA periodically. The contractor is responsible for monitoring the website and incorporating any changes to the NOAA required elements into the contractor provided training.<br />iii.	NOAA's Workplace Violence Program Manager, COR, or CO may periodically review the contractor's training outline to ensure all required elements are included and, if necessary, any appropriate adjustments are made to the training by the contractor.<br />iv.	Contractor employees performing on assignments in a remote location, such as at a field camp or other isolated locations, are subject to receiving the same briefing on the parameters of the order provided to NOAA employees as set forth in Section 6 of NAO 202-1106.</p>
<p>5.	The contractor shall provide a copy of this solicitation and contract language and NAO 202-1106 to contractor employees.</p>
<p>(c)	Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) Helpline.</p>
<p>For NOAA employees, affiliates, and contractors who have experienced sexual assault or sexual harassment, NOAA has established the NOAA Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment (SASH) helpline. This helpline is designed to provide crisis intervention, referrals, and emotional support to those who are victims and/or survivors of sexual harassment or sexual assault within the workplace. Contractor employees may use the helpline to receive live, confidential, one-on-one support in an occurrence of sexual harassment or assault by a Federal Government employee.<br />All services are anonymous, secure, and available worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The NOAA SASH helpline is accessible through a variety of channels, including:</p>
<p>&bull;	Phone: 1-866-288-6558<br />&bull;	Website &amp; Online Chat: http://NOAASASHHelpline.org<br />&bull;	Mobile App: NOAA SASH Helpline (available via iOS and Android App Stores)<br />&bull;	Text: (202) 335-0265</p>
<p>(d)	Confidentiality.</p>
<p>Any party receiving information from the filing of a complaint alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment, or while performing an investigation into such a complaint, shall keep the information confidential. "Confidentiality" means that the information shall only be shared with others who have a need to know the information to conduct their official duties.<br />(e)	Remedies.</p>
<p>In addition to other remedies available to the Government, contractor employee violations of Federal requirements (e.g., law, statutes, executive orders, code, rules, regulations) applicable to sexual assault and sexual harassment and/or failure to complete the mandatory training set forth in this solicitation and contract language, may result in:</p>
<p>1.	Requiring the Contractor to remove a contractor employee or employees from the performance of the contract;<br />2.	Requiring the Contractor to terminate a subcontract;<br />3.	Suspension of contract payments until the Contractor has taken appropriate remedial action;<br />4.

<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p>(a)	The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services as defined in FAR Part 37, Service Contracting, and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor's personnel.  It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>

<p>(c)	The services to be performed under this contract do not require the Contractor or the Contractor's personnel to exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Government.  Rather, the Contractor's personnel will act and exercise personal judgement and discretion on behalf of the Contractor.</p>
<p>(d)	Rules, regulations, directives, and requirements that are issued by the Department of Commerce and NOAA under its responsibility for good order, administration, and security are applicable to all personnel who enter the Government installation and facilities, who are provided access to Government systems, or who travel on Government transportation. This is not to be construed or interpreted to establish any degree of Government control that is inconsistent with a non-personal services contract.</p>

It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties an understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>(b)	Contractor personnel under this contract shall not:</p>
<p>(1)	Be placed in a position where they are under relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government employee.</p>

<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to joel.heisler@noaa.gov no later than 5:00pm PST, Tuesday, 10/30/18.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Joel Heisler at (541) 867-8763 or joel.heisler@noaa.gov  for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. <br />Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>

<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103.

BACKGROUND:</strong>
<div><strong><br /></strong>The Duplication Services service unit at the Library of Congress provides the public with print and digitized copies of nearly everything held in the Library's collections in numerous formats.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; <br />The most popular delivery format is digital PDFs and TIFFs. Customers are often researchers, scholars, publishers, and documentarians.</div>
<div><br />The purpose of the anticipated contract is to provide the Duplication Services service unit with the means to support larger requests without negatively impacting service to its existing customer base.&nbsp; In essense, "overflow" work will be contracted out via the anticipated Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract via Task Orders on an as-needed basis.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /><strong>CONTRACT TYPE:</strong></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong> The Contractor will receive orders on an on-demand basis.  Meaning, that when the Duplication Services service unit receives a large order, the Contractor will be contacted and the work order will be outsourced via a Task Order issued against a base Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract utilizing the pre-negotiated price list contained therein.  All Task Orders will be issued on a firm fixed price basis and may be issued at any time during the period of performance of the base IDIQ contract.
<p><strong>SCOPE OF WORK: </strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide scanning and production of digital images from original Library source materials to archival/FADGI standards on an as-needed basis, both at the Contractor's facility and on-site at the Library of Congress (when digitizing from rare and/or fragile materials than cannot leave the Library) in support of the Duplication Services service unit of the Library of Congress during the period of performance of this contract.</p>
<p><br /><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong><br />The Contractor shall perform requested digitization work either off-site at the Contractor's facility or on-site at the Library of Congress (when producing digital copies from rare and/or fragile source material).  If working on-site at the Library, the Contractor must supply its own digitization equipment and staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />Materials must be digitized to meet individual project needs, to be specified in each issued Task Order. Typically, our standard is 300 ppi 24-bit color uncompressed TIFF images.  The camera should be calibrated to FADGI 3- star (http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov) using the DICE target prior to the start of each scan session. Archival TIFFs and JPEG files should be loaded onto a hard drive.  If copying or digitizing microfilm, the Contractor must supply a positive reel.<br />It is expected that the contractor's pricing includes: image processing, metadata collection/filename schema, quality review (100%), materials, media delivery, shipping, taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The following requirements for digitization services may be ordered via the antcipated contract and offerors must demonstrate in their proposal their ability and experience to providing the following services and to digitize to FADGI archival standards (project-specific standards will be supplied at time of order):</p>
<p><br />1) Provide FADGI 3 star scans of print materials in bulk</p>
<p>2) Provide file names to each digital scan</p>
<p>3) Supply equipment to conduct digital scanning onsite if needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Supply staff to conduct digital scanning onsite when required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Supply staff trained in handling and processing rare and unique materials.</p>
<p>6) Copy and digitize micrographics (including high contrast or continuous tone microfilm). For digital format orders file type will be specified at time of order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) Digitize original materials (including microfilm, microfiche, photographs, negatives, slides, and paper based items such as newspapers, correspondence, journals, blueprints, maps, etc.)</p>
<p>8)&nbsp;Develop project plans that enable Contractor to meet deadlines.  Each deadline will be assessed on a project by project basis and agreed upon before the work is awarded.</p>
<p>9) Digitize micrographics (including high contrast or continuous tone microfilm)&nbsp;</p>
<p>10) OCR document files as requested on order</p>
<p>11) Create 2D and 3D capable files.</p>
<p>12) Print 2D and 3D files.</p>
<p><strong>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: </strong></p>
<p>Task Orders against the base Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract may be placed at any time during the base IDIQ contract period of performance.</p>
<p><br />The contract period of performance of this Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract is anticipated to be as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;					<br />Base year: November 15, 2018- November 14, 2019.<br />Option year 1:  November 15, 2019- November 14, 2020.<br />Option year 2:  November 15, 2020- November 14, 2021.<br />Option year 3:  November 15, 2021- November 14, 2022.<br />Option year 4:  November 15, 2022- November 14, 2023.</p>

<p><br /><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong>Please reference <strong>Section L</strong> in the attached Solicitation, <strong>"Proposal Submission Instructions - Best Value Trade-Off"</strong>, for instructions on how to prepare and submit your proposal (and what information should be included to constitute a complete proposal - <strong>the information being requested is beyond a simple price quote and it is critical that offerors supply information demonstrating their ability and experience in providing the requested digitization services to FADGI archival standards</strong> as this information will be key in the selection of the awardee.  The awardee will NOT be selected on the basis of "Lowest Price - Technically Acceptable", but rather on the basis of "Best Value - Trade Off" whereby the Corporate Experience and Past Performance evaluation factors will be critical in the award selection process and when combined, are considered to be more important than price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reference <strong>Section M</strong> of the attached solicitation, <strong>"Evaluation Factors for Award"</strong> for full details as to how the Government will evaluate offers and select the awardee.</p>
<p><strong>As indicated in Section L, please reference and complete the Pricing Template, Attachment One to the solicitation, for Library-supplied pricing assumptions and the items to be priced.</strong> (Offerors may use their own format/forms as long as all of the requested pricing information is included).</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions and Answers 2<br /></strong>Note: Some question may appear twice, however to ensure that your question was answered all questions were listed and answered.</p>
<p>Q1. The PWS provides a Schedule of Events for the pre-EXEVAL CTE in November but does not provide the same for the EXEVAL in January. Can the government please provide the schedule for the EXEVAL in January?</p>
<p><strong>A1. The pre-EXEVAL schedule of events is the same for January. Training will be from 0800-1600. </strong></p>
<p>Q2. Can the government confirm that a combined minimum wage/benefit of $14.83 per hour is required for role players under the wage determination?</p>
<p><strong>A2. The Government believes that since the role players are not full time employees of the offeror then paying the Health and Welfare would not be required. However, the offeror must follow current rules and regulations for fair pay.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Indiana - Under Executive Order (EO) 13658, an hourly minimum wage of $10.35 for calendar year 2018 applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which the contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1, 2015. If this contract is covered by the EO, the contractor must pay all workers in any classification listed on this wage determination at least $10.35 per hour (or the applicable wage rate listed on this wage determination, if it is higher) for all hours spent performing on the contract in calendar year 2018. The EO minimum wage rate will be adjusted annually. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Florida - Under Executive Order (EO) 13658, an hourly minimum wage of $10.35 for calendar year 2018 applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which the contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1, 2015. If this contract is covered by the EO, the contractor must pay all workers in any classification listed on this wage determination at least $10.35 per hour (or the applicable wage rate listed on this wage determination, if it is higher) for all hours spent performing on the contract in calendar year 2018. The EO minimum wage rate will be adjusted annually. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts. </strong></p>
<p>Q3. Can the government reconfirm what is the minimum number of casualty role players desired for each day of the exercises? The response to Question 1 in the 12 October Q&amp;A stated: "Typically there are about 40 Role players total. 20 trauma and 20 displace. But, offeror should ensure enough personnel to not allow for breaks in training."</p>
<p>- In our professional experience, 40 casualty role players is light but can be sufficient on practice days but is not sufficient at all for External Evaluation (EXEVAL) days when the current NGB standard is 120-125role players to ensure the 60 role player per hour throughput. 40 role players cannot support a 60 per hour through put.</p>
<p>- Recommend that the government consider changing to the requirement to at least 90 role players on the EXEVAL day.</p>
<p><strong>A2. After making several inquiries to counter parts, which have previously conducted this type of exercise, the number of role players required is 100-120 to meet through put requirements. So the Government is acceptable of an increase in the number of role players. </strong></p>
<p>Q4. Regarding para 5.2.1.4 Real World Medical Support-can the government please clarify the number of ambulances required, and whether the requirement is for ALS or BLS level personnel/ambulance?</p>
<p><strong>A4. A normal ambulance crew will be sufficient. Personnel should be able to provide basic medical support and be able to transport any injured personnel to a local hospital. </strong></p>
<p>Q5. Regarding para 5.5 NIMS/ICS Incident Commander-can the government confirm that only one (1) NIMS/ICS SME is required, as these CERFPCTE/EXEVAL exercises normally require 3-4 SMEs for an Incident Command staff.</p>
<p><strong>A5. Two personnel are needed. One to act as the Plans Chief and another to act as the Operations Chief. JITEC will provide the bulk of the experts during the exercise.</strong></p>
<p>Q6. Can the government confirm how many Past Performance references of CERFP External Evaluation (EXEVAL) support are required to be submitted?</p>
<p><strong>A6. A minimum of three will be sufficient.</strong></p>
<p>Q7. Can the government confirm where the role player staging area will be located at each venue? And what the distance will be from the victim medical treatment exit area back to the role player staging area? This is needed to determine how many transport vans may be required.</p>
<p><strong>A7. The area will be close by during the November exercise, less than a quarter mile. Currently the Government cannot confirm this area for the January exercise.</strong></p>
<p>Q8. Will any hard structure be available at either exercise venue for role player staging? Or will the contractor be required to use tents at one or both locations?</p>
<p><strong>A8. There will be a hard structure for the November location, but cannot confirm, at this time, for the January location.</strong></p>
<p>Q9. The Technical Exhibit 3, Estimated Workload Data, states that only one (1) moulage artist is required for each exercise day. It is our professional experience that one moulage artist minimum is required for every 25-30 casualty role players. Can the government confirm that they only require one (1) moulage artist for each exercise day? Or would the government consider changing the requirement to one artist for every 30 role players. Or do another more accurate metric.</p>
<p><strong>A9. The Government has no objections to an increase in the number of moulage artist utilized. Interested offerors have the latitude to provide the necessary support based on their past experience. The intent of the Government is to provide the most realistic training possible.<br /></strong><br />Q10. Can the government confirm if an injury coach is desired for each exercise day? And if so, if this can be added to the Technical Exhibit 3?</p>
<p><strong>A10. This is not needed.</strong></p>
<p>Q11. What is the actual EXEVAL day/date?</p>
<p><strong>A11. The actual EXEVAL day will be 10 January 2019 at Camp Blanding, Florida.</strong></p>
<p>Q12. Will the government provide a building for FLSS to moulage/stage our role players? If so, is the following support available?</p>
<p>a. Is there power? <br />b. Lighting?<br />c. Running water?<br />d. Chairs/tables?</p>
<p><strong>A12. There will be a power and lighting available however at this time there are no tables, chairs or running water.</strong></p>
<p>Q13. Will the government provide a map of the training area?</p>
<p><strong>A14. Yes the Government will provide a map of the training areas.</strong></p>
<p>Q15. Can the contractor moulage the mannequins the day before the exercise starts?</p>
<p><strong>A15. Yes.</strong></p>
<p>Q16. Are there special access procedures required for role players to access the site?</p>
<p><strong>A16. Yes. Successful vendor will need to coordinate with Camp Atterbury and Camp Blanding for access requirements.</strong></p>

If the apparently successful offeror fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable to the contracting officer within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the offeror will be ineligible for award.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>Evaluation of offers shall consist of a two phase approach. Offerors found to be at least acceptable in Evaluation Phase I will be given an opportunity to provide an oral presentation, which will be evaluated as part of the overall offer.</p>
<p>Evaluation of all offers will be made in accordance with the criteria outlined in this section.<br />A single award will be made to the responsible Offeror submitting an overall proposal that is determined most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal meets the Government's requirements and whose technical proposal and price represent the best value to the Government. The evaluation of proposals will be based on the following factors:</p>
<p>(a) Technical Approach<br />(b) Management/Personnel Approach<br />(c) Past Performance <br />(d) Oral Presentation <br />(e) Price (non-rated)</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Approach</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed technical approach in determining the Offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements described in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Management Approach</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's management approach and the extent to which the Offeror has the organizational resources to successfully perform the requirements described in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Past Performance. The SEC will assess the Offeror's performance record, and record of integrity and business ethics for work that is similar and/or relevant to the requirements of the SOW.</p>
<p>Factor 4: Oral Presentation. The Government will evaluate the degree to which the Offeror effectively demonstrates the ability to successfully engage with senior executives and subject matter experts to perform the requirements of the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Technical Approach is more important than Management/Personnel which is more important than Past Performance. Past Performance is more important than the Oral Presentation. When combined, the technical evaluation factors of (a) Technical/Management Approach, (b) Personnel, (c) Past Performance, and (d) Oral Presentation are significantly more important than (e) Price. As the technical proposals become more equal, price becomes more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e., are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced proposal. It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced proposal if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated proposal, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.</p>
<p>Awards may also be made on the basis of initial offers without discussions. Offerors are, therefore, cautioned that each initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms. The failure of an Offeror to meet any given requirement of the RFP in their proposal may result in the entire proposal being found unacceptable and eliminated from the competition.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors:<br /><br />(a) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of any offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>x. The offeror shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certification - Commercial Items (Aug 2018) with its offeror. The offeror shall complete only paragraph b of this provision if the Offeror has completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) website located at https://www.sam.gov/portal.

Further, the proposal must indicate where full details of compliance can be found (e.g., vendor's website or other exact location). The offeror further represents that all ICT products and services that are less than fully compliant have been reviewed and plans to correct are in place.<br />Respondents to this solicitation must provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance. If a vendor claims its products and/or services, including ICT deliverables such as electronic documents, web content or electronic reports, meet applicable Section 508 standards, and it is later determined by the Government - i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products and/or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.</p>

The Contractor shall, without charge to the Government, repair or replace the non-compliant products or services within the period of time to be specified by the Government in<br />writing. If such repair or replacement is not completed within the time specified, the Government shall have the following recourses:<br />The right to Termination of the contract, delivery or task order, purchase or line item without termination liabilities pursuant to the contract termination clauses; or<br />In the case of custom Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) being developed for the Government, the Government shall have the right to have any necessary changes made or repairs performed by itself or by another firm and the contractor shall reimburse the Government for any expenses incurred thereby.<br />For every EIT product or service accepted under this contract by the Government that does not comply with 36 CFR 1194, the contractor shall, at the discretion of the Government, make every effort to replace or upgrade it with a compliant equivalent product or service, if commercially available and cost neutral, on either the planned refresh cycle of the product or service, or on the contract renewal date, whichever shall occur first.<br />In the event of a modification(s) to this contract/order, which adds new EIT products and services or revises the type of, or specifications for, products and services the Contractor is to provide, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, the Contracting Officer may require that the contractor provide an update of information provided in the solicitation to identify EIT compliance. Under any maintenance agreement, Contractor<br />agrees to maintain compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for all EIT.<br />In order to comply with 36 CFR 1194 Section 41, the Contractor shall submit all soft copies (e.g., user manuals, product documentation, etc.) in a format that will be readable using assistive technology, (e.g., screen reader).

In support of these requirements, the<br />Contractor shall have:<br />&bull; policies, procedures, and mechanisms designed to restrict access to SEC data on Contractor, subcontractor, or SEC inter/intra agency partner systems exclusively to authorized personnel;<br />&bull; policies, procedures, and mechanisms that prevent transmission or disclosure of SEC data to an unauthorized party;<br />&bull; policies, procedures, and mechanisms that ensure SEC data on portable devices are encrypted using methods compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2; and<br />&bull; policies, procedures, and mechanisms that ensure SEC data transmitted across public networks (i.e., the Internet) by the Contractor, or its employees, agents or subcontractors, are protected using encryption compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2.<br />(c) The Contractor shall provide quarterly assessments to the SEC demonstrating that the policies, procedures, and mechanisms required by (b) continue to be functional, that the Contractor is compliant with these requirements, and that these requirements are effective.<br />(d) The Contractor shall provide a copy of its privacy policies to the Contracting Officer.

The Contractor shall act in accordance with its policies and procedures in the event of any suspected loss of SEC PII and shall support the SEC's investigation and resolution of reported incidents as requested by the SEC. For purposes of this Clause, a "suspected loss of PII" shall be interpreted liberally to mean any situation in which the loss of PII or unapproved access to PII is deemed a reasonable possibility.</p>
<p>6015.0 SEC On-Site Contractors (Feb 2012)<br />Space, desk, phone and laptop computer will be made available to on-site contractor personnel at the SEC for use in the performance of their task and will be returned when they are no longer on-site.</p>
<p>6016.00 Supplies (Jan 2013, revised May 2013)<br />The Contractor shall provide all supplies to support the requirements of this award. The SEC will not provide supplies used in the normal daily performance of work such as note paper, pens, calendars, staplers, etc. If there is a need for specific supplies required by the performance of the work, the Contractor's Program Manager shall notify the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>6020.00 Contractor Workforce Inclusion (Aug 2015)<br />The Contractor confirms its commitment to equal opportunity in employment and contracting, and that it shall ensure, to the maximum extent possible and consistent with applicable law, the fair inclusion of minorities and women in its workforce.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall insert the substance of this contract standard in each subcontract for services awarded for performance of this contract with a dollar value of $100,000 or more.</p>
<p>Within ten (10) business days of a written request from the Director of the Commission's Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI Director) or designee, or such longer time as the OMWI Director or designee determines, and without any additional consideration, action or authorization required from the OMWI Director, the Contractor shall provide documentation, satisfactory to the OMWI Director, of the actions it has undertaken (and as applicable, the actions each covered subcontractor under the contract has undertaken) to demonstrate its good faith efforts to comply with the aforementioned provisions.</p>
<p>For purposes of this contract, "good faith efforts" shall include actions by the Contractor (and as applicable, actions by each covered subcontractor under the Service Contract) to identify and, if present, remove barriers to minority and women employment or expansion of employment opportunities for minorities and women within its workforce. Efforts to remove such barriers may include, but are not limited to, recruiting to ensure that applicant pools include minorities and women, providing job-related training, or other activity that could lead to removing such barriers.</p>
<p>The documentation requested by the OMWI Director or designee to demonstrate good faith efforts may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following:</p>
<p>&bull; The total number of Contractor's employees, and the number of employees by race, ethnicity, gender, and job title or EEO-1 Report job category (e.g., EEO-1 Report(s));<br />&bull; A list of covered subcontract awards for services under the contract, and for each covered subcontract award, the dollar amount, date of award, and the subcontractor's race, ethnicity, and/or gender ownership status;<br />&bull; The contractor's plan for ensuring the fair inclusion of minorities and women in its workforce, including outreach efforts; and<br />&bull; For each covered subcontractor, the documentation specified in paragraphs a. and c. above.</p>
<p>Consistent with Section 342(c)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), 12 U.S.C. 5452(c)(3), a Contractor's failure to demonstrate to the OMWI Director that it has made good faith efforts to include minorities and women in its workforce (and as applicable, failure to demonstrate that its subcontractor(s) has made such good faith efforts) may result in termination of the contract for default after the contractor is provided written notice and an opportunity to cure the failure in accordance with the procedures set forth in FAR Subpart 49.402-3(d), other contractual remedies, referral to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), or other appropriate action.</p>
<p>Compliance with this standard does not necessarily satisfy the requirements of EO 11246, as amended, nor does it preclude OFCCP compliance evaluations and/or enforcement actions undertaken pursuant to that Executive Order, or demonstrate compliance with other FAR clauses that may be included in this contract.</p>

"Audited annual financial statements" are required only for those firms with actual receipts of more than $10,000,000. If our firm has gross annual receipts between $2,000,000 and $10,000,000 will "reviewed annual financial statements from a licensed independent public accountant" be sufficient for this proposal? Yes, it will be sufficient for this proposal.<br />

<p>The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement, if a requirement materializes. Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition. All small business set-aside categories will be considered. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding submissions.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) TO BE SUBMITTED. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) is a capability providing the Department of Defense (DOD) cyberspace workforce the ability to conduct cyberspace operations training (including exercises and mission rehearsals), experimentation, certification, as well as the assessment and development of cyber capabilities and tactics, techniques, and procedures for missions that cross boundaries and networks. PCTE provides the capability required to train forces operating in cyberspace in accordance with congressional and DOD mandates.</p>
<p>PCTE's ultimate solution will be a cloud-based training platform to support Cyber workforce with individual through force level sustainment training, team certification, and provide the foundations for a collective training network (i.e. Cyber Flag, Cyber Guard). It will leverage existing architecture and capability, including existing Service tools connected to the various cyber ranges, in order to provide the emulated environments for virtual cyber training. The materiel development activities for PCTE include integrating hardware and software into a training platform that orchestrates event planning, training resources, and after action review into a cohesive and networked training event.</p>
<p>The PCTE platform, in its desired end state, will use integrated virtual machines connecting Cyber Training and Test Ranges. As part of the Cyber Range cloud-based environment, PCTE will have the ability to share resources, such as scenarios and content, and providing additional "maneuver space" such as emulated Red (adversarial), Blue (friendly), Grey (neutral), and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments. It will connect to six geographically disperse Cyber workforce locations and allow individual units to access capabilities and participate in distributed training (called Connectivity). PCTE is not a cyber range; it is every aspect of training exercise means and training systems that would take place in a range.</p>
<p>The PCTE program continually deploys prototype capabilities through competitive Cyber Innovation Challenges (CICs) to the field to include such capabilities as event management, environment creation/replication, and connections into to the Services' Crew Training Facilities. With continued evaluation of the CIC prototypes by Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) personnel, the PCTE platform will evolve based on changes in technology, threat, and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). These changes will require software developed by contractors, external vendors, and other Government organizations to be holistically incorporated into the existing platform for rapid delivery.</p>
<p>Product Manager (PdM) Cyber Resiliency and Training (CRT) is currently integrating vendor solutions into the modular PCTE baseline that includes a number of commercial and proprietary products. Integration requires technical data exchange, specifications, and coordination with other contractors to ensure compatibility and selection the best-of-breed cyberspace operations training platform. It is expected the P-CIDC contract will require the integration of software delivered under the CICs to meet identified gaps and integrate new capabilities.</p>
<p>As part of the lifecycle sustainment of PCTE, the PdM CRT has a requirement for a contracting vehicle to continue development operations with the integration of software and hardware enhancements delivered on other contracts as technology insertion occurs while conducting testing, providing periodic system updates, and fielding technology upgrades of PCTE to CMF. In addition, the contract will provide a limited operations and maintenance support for PCTE to ensure high system availability throughout the acquisition life cycle. The contract will be dynamic and agile to support a highly complex joint program operating in a number of classifications at geographically disparate sites requiring 24/7 on-demand accessibility.</p>
<p>The P-CIDC has the underlying need to ensure standardization, synchronization, and management while maximizing reuse, commonality and high system availability while maintaining the systems cyber security posture. The contract must provide for a dynamic mechanisms for multiphase configuration management, development and support, integration and sustainment labs, and technology insertion and growth.</p>
<p>The purpose of the P-CIDC contract is to support the business goals of the PCTE program. These goals include:</p>
<p>&bull; Decreasing time to produce and present training scenarios<br />&bull; Increasing training throughput<br />&bull; Increasing quality of training<br />&bull; Increasing the reuse of training scenarios/emulated environments</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES<br />The Government requires the development and integration of software, hardware and associated levels of testing to support release of PCTE material solution to satisfy current and future PCTE requirements. In this the Government seeks the contractor to deliver a fully integrated training platform involving software and hardware contributions from various sources for integration, to include performing testing prior to fielding the software. This will require such activities that include software development, system integration, test and system delivery and upgrades to ensure compliance with contract requirements and timely delivery of required products. It is expected the system development, integration and release of the PCTE platform will occur with direct Cyber Mission Forces (CMF) user-centric feedback integrated and driving agile six month capability releases.</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor will provide a real time web-based reporting mechanism to collect, store and analyze operations, maintenance, supply, and inventory data of all the sites. This reporting system will provide Government access for the purposes of operations and logistics reviews. A customer call in center will be required providing twenty-four hours per day seven days a week toll-free call-in support services. The contract efforts are to include repairs and replacement stocks for maintaining required Operational Availability (Ao) of 95%; it will include updates to logistic documentation such as provisioning data, tech manuals and drawings, and provide integration instruction and field support for SW and HW upgrades at customer locations. This effort will encompass logistics support and sustainment of Regional Compute and Storage (RCS) nodes over seven locations CONUS and OCONUS.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The development of HIV vaccines and other prevention strategies relies on the use of nonhuman primates in preclinical studies to advance the development of effective AIDS vaccine candidates and to advance development of effective topical microbicides and other prevention modalities or immune-based therapies. For this reason, he NIAID, Division of AIDS, has a requirement for Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units.
<p><strong>Description<br /></strong>The NIAID Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit (SVEU) contracts shall provide nonhuman primate resources that primarily support preclinical evaluation of AIDS vaccines and prevention strategies. The SVEUs conduct studies in support of vaccines being developed by a wide range of investigators. These studies complement NIAID-supported basic vaccine research and vaccine evaluation studies funded through R01 (investigator-initiated research) grants, HIVRAD (HIV Vaccine Research and Design Program) grants, IPCAVD (Integrated Preclinical-Clinical AIDS Vaccine Development) grants, and NHP Consortium awards. The SVEUs also perform studies of candidate vaccines offered by companies or other researchers.</p>
<p>The SVEUs will use state-of-the-art techniques and technologies in evaluating promising AIDS prevention strategies in nonhuman primate models and will incorporate new and improved techniques and technologies into the studies conducted throughout the contract period.</p>
<p>This is a recompetition of existing contracts entitled "Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units (SVEUs)" (contract number HHSN272201300002I with Advanced BioScience Laboratory, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, contract number HHSN272201300003I with BioQual, Inc., Rockville, Maryland, and contract number HHAN272201300004I with Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana).</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance<br /></strong>NIAID anticipates awarding two to three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts to the organizations that best meet the overall qualifications needed to fulfill the technical requirements outlined in the Statement of Work. The base contracts will be awarded on or about February 1, 2020 for a period of 7 years, through January 31, 2027.</p>
<p>The requirement includes four Task Areas as follows: Task Area 1: Administrative, Management, and Technical Support Core Activities, Task Area 2: Maintenance of Nonhuman Primates, Task Area 3: Conduct of Studies in Nonhuman Primates, and Task Area 4: Operation of a Nonhuman Primate Breeding Colony.</p>
<p>Offerors must demonstrate capabilities to perform all of the work in Task Areas 1, 2, and 3, or the work in Task Area 4 alone. Offerors may submit capabilities to perform all work in Task Areas 1, 2, 3, and 4. If an offeror chooses to submit a capability statement for all Task Areas, the capabilities for Task Area 4 should be included in a separate section.</p>
<p>Facilities requirements include: 1) Animal Biosafety Level (ABSL) 2/3 facilities (ABSL2 with ABSL3 practices) capable of housing from 200 to 300 nonhuman primates on Study Plans; and 2) ABSL2/3 facilities capable of housing approximately 15-30 nonhuman primates not assigned to a Study Plan. As appropriate for the task order, other facilities requirements may include: 1) ABSL2 facilities capable of housing approximately 30-60 nonhuman primates not assigned to a Study Plan; and 2) facilities for housing a breeding colony of approximately 500-550 SPF Indian-origin Rhesus macaques.</p>
<p>Below is a general description of the Task Areas:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Task Area 1 - Core Activities: Administrative and Technical Support:</span> Under this Task Area the Contractor shall support work that will be performed on a regular, on-going basis including (i) general administration and financial management; (ii) project planning (iii) coordination of activities across all nonhuman primate activities awarded to an SVEU unit under Task Areas 2 and 3; (iv) receipt, storage and shipment of vaccines, virus stocks, study samples including cells, tissues, mucosal secretions, blood, sera, and plasma; (v) reporting and maintenance of data; and (vi) transition activities.</p>

<DESC><p>The Netherlands Carillon tower is a 127' tall x 25' deep x 36' wide steel framed structure with steel panel cladding. The tower houses 50 bronze bells, and the total weight of the bells is over 30 tons. There is also a climate controlled room with a wooden console which allows carilloneurs to play the bells and perform public concerts. Built in 1960, the carillon was last renovated/repaired in 1994 through a cooperative agreement with the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce (the 1994 repairs were completed at no cost to the NPS).<br /><br />The tower structure is showing severe signs of deterioration and the early stages of structural failure. This deterioration is accelerating at such an alarming rate that all public access to the tower structure area is closed. Access to the tower structure, tower stairs and platforms is currently restricted to official business only.<br />This project will rehabilitate the monument following the Secretary of Interior's Standards of Rehabilitation. The specific project scope is as follows:<br /><br />&bull; Develop Construction Drawings<br />&bull; Develop and maintain a construction schedule<br />&bull; Develop and maintain a Health and Safety Plan<br />&bull; Develop and maintain a Quality Control Program<br />&bull; Tree and landscape protection, secure work area, and temporary facilities<br />&bull; Asbestos abatement<br />&bull; Provide as-constructed drawings<br />&bull; Remove and replace deteriorated exterior cladding panels.<br />&bull; Remove and replace deteriorated sections of metal support structure.<br />&bull; Remove paint and rust scale from entire structure and apply galvanizing compound to structural steel members including the rear and sides of exterior cladding panels.<br />&bull; Remove and replace rubber isolators and threaded fasteners.<br />&bull; Remove and replace deteriorated checkered plate floor panels at lower and upper floor landings.<br />&bull; Remove existing metal ceiling panels under lower floor landing and replace deteriorated structural angle ceiling supports. Sandblast, paint and reinstall ceiling panels<br />&bull; Rehabilitate handrails around perimeter of observation platforms, stair landings, and stairs<br />&bull; Rehabilitate access stairs<br />&bull; Install new roofing at the clavier room and soundboard roof<br />&bull; Remove the existing aviation lights which are currently not functioning and contain mercury<br />&bull; Coordination with the Netherlands Embassy's renovation: removal, refurbishing and return of the existing 50 bells, elevation to Grand Carillon status with 3 new bells, reconfiguration and installation of the 53 bells and their related systems, and full mechanical upgrade of instrument keyboards</p>

<SOLNBR>19-REG05_MONTHLY
<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<RESPDATE>110718

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and are located under the "HELP" tab on the website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<div><br />&nbsp;
<p>The Open Period for<strong>&nbsp;NOVEMBER</strong>* is November 1, 2018 to November 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement that will be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2019 (10/1/2018 - 9/30/19) or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 19-REG05 must be located within Region 5.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 17 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2018, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2019 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY19 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&amp;A)<br />FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION J&amp;A Number N102A-18-D-1000
<p>1. Contracting Activity: Military Sealift Command, Norfolk, VA, N102A IT/Engineering Supplies and Services (ITESS).</p>
<p>2. Description of the Action Being Approved: Providing notice and justification for continuation of services for a period of approximately six (6) months from 19 Oct 2018 to 18 April 2019 for the Military Sealift Command (MSC) Contract N32205-18-D-1000, for Information Technology Engineering Support Services (ITESS) and all of its Task Orders. MSC awarded Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract N32205-18-D-1000 for ITESS in August of 2018. A small business size protest was received prior to the issuance of the award to Sentient Digital, Inc. doing business as Entrust Government Solutions. The Small Business Administration (SBA) did not adjudicate the protest within 15 business days and the award was made in accordance with FAR 19.302(g)(2) on 07 August 2018. The SBA completed their size determination on 23 August 2018 and found Entrust Government Solutions to be an other than small business for this specific contract. An appeal to the SBA office of hearings by Entrust Government Solutions was rejected on 09 October 2018. The Government, under the authority of this Justification and Approval, will continue the current contract with Entrust Government Solutions until 18 April 2019 to conduct a proper and thorough recompete, at which that time the Government will terminate the base award and all task orders under contract N32205-18-D-1000 in accordance 13 C.F.R. 121.1009. This action is being conducted under an other than full and open competition basis to the incumbent contractor Entrust Government Solutions utilizing the single award IDIQ contract vehicle.</p>
<p>3. Description of the Supplies/Services: N32205-18-D-1000 provides "ITESS" that assists N6 manage emerging requirements, enhances and develops IT capabilities in support of MSC's mission, and assists in the development of governance to ensure IT capabilities align to MSC N6's strategic plan, align to MSC N6's technical architecture road maps, and meet DoD mandates. The total estimated dollar value for this action is approximately $2,979,048.30. The value for this action is derived from the labor rates, travel, and material costs proposed by the incumbent contractor under the current contract and all issued Task Orders. The period of performance for this action will be from 19 Oct 2018 through 18 April 2019. See paragraph 5 below for more information.</p>
<p>The Task Orders included in this sole source justification are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Secure Host Baseline (SHB)<br />Contract Management<br />NAVAIDS<br />Mobile Communications<br />Visual Information (VI)<br />Change Management <br />Integrated Configuration and Asset Management (ICAM)<br />MSC C4 Engineering Lab (MCEL)<br />Afloat CLAN GOSUP version 2 (ACGV2), and Afloat CLAN GOSUP version 3 (ACGV3)<br />Service, Validation, and Testing (SV&amp;T)<br />Enterprise Architecture (EA)<br />In Service Engineering Activities (ISEA)<br />Windows Secure Host Baseline Process Engineering (WIN SHB)</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition. This action is essentially continuation of performance under a valid current contract to cover a period before termination of that contract as required by 13 CFR &sect; 121.1009(g)(2). Alternatively, it could be characterized as authorized as a sole-source, limited duration contract under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), One source or limited sources, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, for the reasons set forth in paragraph 5, below, and in the unusual and unforeseeable circumstances described in paragraph 2, above.</p>
<p>5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority. Under Contract N32205-18-D-1000, Entrust Government Solutions is currently providing highly specialized services in the form of critical support to MSC by delivering Systems Network Engineering and IT Service Management support services. This includes systems planning, research, and development engineering that deliver secure and accredited networks and capabilities for both MSC's classified and unclassified ships networks. Additionally, these services support the configuration management and control for MSC C4S hardware and software assets and the C4S System Validation &amp; Testing capability to ensure a secure network environment.</p>
<p>The immediate termination of the current contract would ultimately result in a gap in service for the Government and an interruption or suspension of the support services and projects under this contract including the MSC C4 Engineering Lab. The termination would eliminate the current Service Validation &amp; Tests required to field new software versions which prevents the Government from remediating IT vulnerabilities. This would also cause the Supporting Patching and Antivirus updating with support of the MSC C4 Engineering Lab (MCEL) for the N62 patch disk preparation and validation to no longer maintain the software images to be up to date and compliant including software associations in the DoN Application and Database Management System (DADMS). An immediate termination would deny the deployment of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) System categorization and MSC's accredited systems or software. Terminating the current contract would also disable MSC's ability to maintain compliant systems and networks within the In-Service Engineering SMIS including Windows 10 image deployment, mobile communications integration tests, the Afloat CLAN GOSUP version two upgrade and version 3 development, NAVAIDS Windows 10 system upgrade, visual information integration and testing, AC2 modem support and integration testing, and the integrated configuration and asset management.</p>
<p>The continuation of services by Entrust Government Solutions enables MSC to continue to operate C4S systems worldwide in support of its mission. No other source is currently in a position to supply these critical services while providing continuity of operations, pending any effort to solicit new sources and re-compete the contract. Any award to another company to provide these services during this interim period would result in unacceptable delays and gaps in fulfilling MSC's critical requirements as well as immense budgetary restrictions. Awarding any interim contract is not feasible as there is insufficient time to solicit a new procurement, account for a turnover period between incumbent and awardee, and allow time for the awardee to obtain a Secret Facility Clearance. Any lag or gap in the continued provision of these critical services is operationally unacceptable. The incumbent contractor is the only source in a position to provide continued, uninterrupted service. As such, awarding a 6-month "extension," in essence continuing the contract awarded in August 2018 to the incumbent, is the best and only viable option.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable. The recompete effort for the ITESS contract is projected for award on or before 18 March 2019 with a start date of 18 April 2019, allowing for a transition period. Solicitation N32205-19-R-1000, the recompete effort, is currently underway with a scheduled release date of 18 November 2018. As the time period is critically short, see paragraph 5 above, and the market research conducted in 2017-18 is recent, no additional market research was conducted. It is anticipated that several companies will express interest in the solicitation, thereby ensuring good competition.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost. The current contract has approved rates based on adequate competition and the task orders listed in paragraph 3 that have been determined fair and reasonable. This justification and approval enables the current contract and all Task Orders to remain in effect through 18 April 2019. The rates have already been determined to be fair and reasonable using price analysis techniques described in FAR 15.404-1(b).</p>
<p>Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition. A new competitive Solicitation, N32205-19-R-1000, will be issued through Federal Business Opportunities no later than 19 November 2018. The new Solicitation will be very similar to that which was released for the current contract, N32205-18-R-1002, in both the scope of work and evaluation criteria to minimize the amount of Government re-work and in the proposal submissions, saving the Government both time and money. As such, the circumstances giving rise to the need for the extension of services through 18 April 2019 have been addressed by the Government and are not expected to recur prior to award of the new contract.</p>
