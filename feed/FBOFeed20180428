The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>The Government intends to award on a sole source basis to General Micro Systems CAGE Code:  0A8J6, 8358 MAPLE PL RANCHO CUCAMONGA, CA, 91730-3839 for the acquisition of approved electronic components supporting the LCAC 100 baseline as follows:
<p>1 Each 97-2648-000 S930-FSS, 2.3 Ghz Quad Core i7, 16 GB RAM, 256GB RSSD<br />6 Each 97-2649-000 VSB2102, R1, 32GB RAM, 128GB MSATA, 128GB 2.5"<br />6 Each 95-2110-000 Rear Transition Module for VSB2102</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) General Micro Systems, Inc. (e.g. GMS), is the only responsible source capable of providing licenses and training. This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition and it is in the best interest of the Government to acquire this item using a non-competitive purchase for the following reasons:<br />a. Electronic components from GMS have been selected by the LCAC 100 integrator as<br />key components in the Data Storage Device (DSD) and navigation system. It is not<br />cost effective to replace the system baseline as it will require a change to the production contract and will impact successful completion of acquisition milestones for the program in FY19. The cost of integrating any other brand of similar system capabilities is estimated at $4,000,000.00 over the course of 36 months. As a result, it is in the Governments best interest to award on a sole source basis as aforementioned. See attached clausesSection C - Specifications</p>

<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts.  CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification.  This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended.  FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy:  adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems.  Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /> <br />Information Safeguards<br /> <br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned  duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a.  Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b.  Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c.  Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system.  However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /> <br /> a.  Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e.  Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /> <br /> f.  Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /> <br /> h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j.  Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /> <br /> (1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /> <br /> (2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k.  Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l.  Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information:  facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br /> - Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br /> - Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br /> - Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br /> - Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br /> - Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br /> - Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br /> - Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>
<p>The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:<br /> <br /> - Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; <br /> - Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; <br /> - Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; <br /> - Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; <br /> - When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;<br /> - During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Section F - Deliveries or performance</p>

<CONTACT>Steven Baldomero, Assistant, Phone 8502307468, Email steven.baldomero2@navy.mil
<DESC>The Government intends to award on a sole source basis to NORTH ATLANTIC INDUSTRIES, INC. CAGE Code: 0VGU1, 110 WILBUR PL BOHEMIA, NY, 11716-2416 for the acquisition of approved electronic components supporting the LCAC 100 baseline as follows:
<p>Sensor Interface Unit with P/N: SIU35-AB-0002</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) NORTH ATLANTIC INDUSTRIES, INC., is the only responsible source capable of providing licenses and training. This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition and it is in the best interest of the Government to acquire this item using a non-competitive purchase for the following reasons:<br />a. The Sensor Interface Unit from NAI has been selected by the LCAC 100 integrator as<br />Data Acquisition Unit (DAU) for the craft. It is not cost effective to replace the LCAC<br />100 system baseline as it will require a change to the LCAC 100 production contract and<br />will impact successful completion of acquisition milestones for the program in FY19.<br />The cost of integrating any other brand of similar system capabilities is estimated at<br />$2,000,000.00 over the course of 36 months.</p>
<p>Section C - Specifications</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.
