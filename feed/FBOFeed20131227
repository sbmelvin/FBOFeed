<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. A SUBSEQUENT SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT MAY FOLLOW. RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE TO ANY FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENT.

The Louis Stokes Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (LSDVAMC), Cleveland, Ohio 44106 anticipates award of an indefinite quantity FIRM FIXED PRICE contract. The purpose of this contract is to engage community providers (Contractors) who will provide emergency housing to Veterans along with services consistent with Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program objectives. The goal of this contract is to remove homeless Veterans or Veterans with families from the street or places unfit for human habitation and place them in community-based, residential environments. These residences must have sufficient services to meet the needs of the Veterans or Veterans with families served. Entities that are interested in providing Veterans these services should be aware that this contract seeks to provide services and housing in the area of Stark County of Ohio only.
The Contractor shall provide housing, to include, but not necessarily limited to beds, restroom, bath and kitchen facilities and related furnishings. The Contractor shall provide food for a minimum of two balanced meals daily and snacks daily to each resident. The Contractor shall provide personal hygiene items and storage as needed.
The primary goal is to develop Emergency Contract Transition Housing (ECTH) for the Veterans and to prepare them for independent living. It is the ultimate goal that these Veterans will eventually find their way to housing located within the community.
Through this announcement, the VA seeks to support Veterans served by ECTH by expediting placement of these Veterans into safe, supportive housing. This housing must meet the criteria established both by IOP clinical staff and VA fire and safety officials in addition to the local city, county and state regulations.

The HCHV Program, an essential and critical part of VHA, is vital for providing a gateway to VA and community supportive services for eligible Veterans who are homeless.  

THIS "PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUCEMENT" SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR OFFERS.  A FORMAL SOLICITATION WILL FOLLOW THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE COMING DAYS.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: <br />The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), seeks the services of a qualified small business general contractor (GC) to renovate the Main Building (Building No # 1) at the South Bronx Job Corps Center in Bronx, New York. <br />The project involves construction services for a phased renovation project for the Main Building (Building No. 1) at the South Bronx Job Corps Center. The work consists of three components, namely: mechanical/plumbing, electrical and architectural upgrades throughout the building, including miscellaneous site improvements such as general landscaping, drainage, pavements and connections to existing utility lines as may be required. The mechanical/plumbing component comprises the installation of new HVAC system(s) to provide thermal comfort throughout the building. The electrical component consists of upgrades to the building's power supply to support the new mechanical/plumbing systems. The architectural component consists of historical restoration of the building's exterior stone envelope and roofs, such as to render it weather-tight, as well as interior upgrades to finishes and restrooms.</p>
<p>Building 1 has been listed as a Historic Landmark by the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission. Therefore, all work to be carried out on the exterior of the building is to be executed with due regard for its historical character and significance.</p>
<p>The project has been designed by others under a previous contract and project title. The Scope of Work requires the contractor to review the original design as a reference and update it as required to meet current codes as well as compliance with the Scope of Work. The contractor shall develop a set of Contract Documents and Specifications reflecting the current conditions of the building and all applicable codes and standards.</p>
<p>WHO MAY RESPOND: <br />Interest in this pre-solicitation announcement is open to certified small business contractors, relative to the primary NAICS code 236220 with a Small Business Size Standard of $33.5 Million dollars.

You will need your DUNS number and CCR MPIN in order to log into the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: <br />Selection of the successful bidder will be made by the Contracting Officer using the sealed bid process based on Responsive, Responsible, and Lowest [Reasonable] Price bid of the successful bidder. The successful bidder must be determined as responsive, meaning a bid that complies in all material respects with the invitation for bids as prescribed by FAR 14.301 and 14.404-2. As prescribed by FAR 9.104, the successful bidder must also be determined as responsible which is evaluated prior to award after selecting an apparent successful bidder. Last, the Contracting Officer will ascertain whether prices offered by the successful bidder are reasonable. The standard price analysis techniques in FAR 15.404-1 will be used in making this determination. If prices received are not considered reasonable, the Contracting Officer may either: cancel the solicitation; or convert from the sealed bid process to a negotiated process as described within FAR 14.401-1.</p>

<DESC>USAID/CAR Regional Mission intends to issue a solicitation to qualified offerors for the USAID Kyrgyz Republic Agriculture Activity to be implemented in Kyrgyzstan.
<p>The estimated cost of the contract is within the rage from $22,500,000 - $24,000,000. The period of performance is anticipated to be four years, beginning on or about October 1, 2014.</p>
<p>This agricultural project is a key component of USAID Kyrgyz Republic's overall economic development program designed to accelerate the growth of diversified and equitable economic growth in the Kyrgyz Republic.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is for the agricultural value chain(s) to increase productivity and output, increase nutritious foods available to agricultural producers, increase employment in the agricultural sector, and increase the market share of crops in the value chains(s) in both domestic and foreign markets.</p>
<p>Growth in the agricultural sector is slower than the growth of the total Kyrgyz economy. According to the World Bank, real annual GDP in the agricultural grew at an annual rate of 2.27 percent from 2003-2010. Meanwhile formal employment in agriculture fell from 43 percent to 32 percent of the total labor force. Growth in agriculture is hampered by credit, land management, quality control, tax, and trade constraints. Despite the problems, agriculture remains important to the wellbeing of Kyrgyz citizens. Over half of rural households earn income from agriculture.</p>
<p>Kyrgyz Republic is part of the US government's Feed the Future initiative. Though not a focus country, USAID's work in Kyrgyz Republic contributes to the initiative's high-level goals of reducing poverty and stunting, and the agency's work is guided by Feed the Future operational principles.</p>
<p>The zone of influence for this project - and thus the area of geographic focus - is defined as the entirety of Naryn, Jalalabad, Osh, and Batken Oblasts. While this project will focus on a particular geographic area, work with value-chain actors in other areas may be warranted, particularly if it has relevance to the zone of influence.</p>
<p>Priority will be given to developing value chains that directly involve smallholder farmers in the zone of influence and/or expand their access to markets.</p>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
Radial Artery Compression Device
Micro Access Kit

1. Background
A. Radial Artery Compression Device
The radial artery compression device has the ability to achieve hemostasis without compromising local nerve structure, enhances patient comfort and provides direct visualization of the access site to facilitate management following transradial procedures.

The radial artery compression device is designed to safely and comfortably stop bleeding after transradial procedures and with its easy-to-apply transparent band and precision pressure balloons that enable unobstructed visualization and monitoring of radial artery compression - all while preventing numbness and pain for enhanced patient comfort.

The primary benefit that the radial artery compression device  has over similar devices is its directed radial compression, which enables hemostasis achievement without compromising local nerve structure and does so with its two separate inflatable balloons. A large balloon compresses the entire puncture site, and a small balloon gives it an angled direction for point compression. This dual system enables the radial artery compression device to avoid compression of the nerves or the ulnar artery, which can cause discomfort and/or complications. The transparent band, which allows full visibility to the clinician during the critical post procedure stage, is another significant clinical benefit of this product.


In an age of increasing peripheral vascular disease and our nation's propensity for obesity, radial access has significant advantages over femoral access when considering the complications and challenges often associated with this approach. 

The required types and specifications of radial artery compression devices are as follows:
a)	 Radial artery compression device:
Radial artery compression device provide the approximate size to achieve hemostasis following transradial procedures:
i.	TR Band Product Code: XX*RF06		TR Band Type:  Regular		Length:  24 cm
ii.	TR Band Product Code: XX*RF06L	TR Band Type:  Long		Length: 	29 cm
 

B.  Micro Access Kit
Micro Access Kit is  a vascular access system specifically designed for smooth, efficient, and reliable vascular access. It offers the a tapered introducer needle to minimize vessel trauma, dilate the tissue, and gain more precise access in difficult cases, such as those impeded by scar tissue or calcification.
Micro Access Kit will help to  achieve success in peripheral vascular intervention, specifically where critical limb ischemia (CLI) is present  From the tapered needle to the TIF (Total Integrated Fit) sheath, it provides a seamless transition for vascular access femorally or peripherally."
One of the Micro Access Kit's most significant advantages is the elimination of procedural steps compared to alternative products. Traditionally, once access is achieved, the site is gradually enlarged to the desired French size by exchanging to a larger wire and sheath.  The micro access kit eliminates the need for both a micropuncture kit and a standard size introducer sheath. It features proven TIF (Total Integrated Fit) technology and a new tapered 21 gauge needle that allow for a smaller, straighter and more accurate puncture to significantly reduce vessel entry site trauma and access complications.
The required types and specifications of micro access kits are as follows:
a)	 Micro Access Kit:
Micro Access Kit for peripheral vascular intervention:
i.	Pinnacle Precision Access System  Product Code:  70-5240  Sheath Size  (Fr):  5  Wire:  Nitinol  Needle:    Non-Echogenic  Sheath length:  10 cm  Wire length:  45 cm  Tapered needle gauge: 21G/19G
	

2. Scope
The essential requirement is for the contractor to provide an annual supply of  each type Terumo TR Bands and Pinnacle Precision Access System, as enumerated in the 2237 # 660-14-1-060-0001  request provided.   Only the initial supply is to be delivered upon award.  Orders for additional quantities up to the maximum annual quantity are to be placed as needed by authorized VASLCHCS Logistics staff.  This request includes the option to increase quantities of items if additional needs above the annual estimate are identified.  Two option years are required to meet demands of the recurring need.  Competed bids must meet or exceed all listed specifications.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center is conducting a sources sought/market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified businesses capable of serving the needs mentioned below.  This sources sought/market survey announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy.  This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research.  The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this sources sought/market survey.<br /><br />The Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health has a requirement to provide the Department of Clinical Research Informatics with CBORD FMS maintenance and support, for a fixed-price type contract, and will include one 12-month base period, with four 12-month options to extend the effective period of the contract.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541519 (small business size standard is $25.0).<br /><br />The CBORD system is used to manage patient's dietary information as well as the delivery of patient meals at the NIH Clinical Center.  CBORD FMS consists of two major modules: 1) Food Service Suite (FSS) and 2) Nutrition Service Suite (NSS).<br /><br />FSS went live July 2003.  FSS provides the basis of the whole system.  It contains recipe, nutrition and dietary compliance information.  It also handles ordering and requisitioning, and is currently being developed to submit electronic orders to our prime vendor.  The Handheld Inventory Management System (HIMS) module is a component of FSS, providing for the use of handheld barcode readers for inventorying stock.<br /><br />NSS went live May 2004.  NSS is interfaced with CRIS, receiving patient diet orders for patients.  NSS provides a meal entry interface used by our room service call center to enter patients' meal selections, using the diet order to screen out foods that are inappropriate for the patient.  The system also provides a variety of other nutrition related tools.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide support for the following features or modules listed below.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award sole source award to Desktop Alert Inc. The award will be made for the purchase <br> of 1 year annual software assurance and technical support for the Desktop Alert Software that was purchased for the TNARNG. This procurement is being conducted under the <br> Federal Acquistion Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services <br> will satisfy requirements and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. All inquiries and concerns must be <br> emailed to SSG Jonathan Forren at jonathan.d.forren.mil@mail.mil no later than 4 P.M. Centeral time, 10 JAN 2014. Any response to this must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to <br> the government in future procurements. POC for this is SSG Jonathan Forren. The following justifcation and <br> approval is to provide for only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy agency <br> requirements: <br> SUBJECT:  Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition  <br>  <br>  <br> 1.	  This request is for justification for other than full and open competition for the J6 Directorate of the TNARNG.  <br>  <br> 2.	  This request is for the Desktop Alert Mass Notification support maintenance and support for the Desktop Alert System that the TNARNG currently has in place <br>  <br> 3.	  The TNARNG currently has the Desktop Alert Mass Notification Software in place that was purchased by NGB. This software provides the J6 with the capabilities of providing mass notification via the network to PC's across the state of Tennessee.  The maintenance agreement for this software, which is solely provided by Desktop Alert, Inc, provides the following support: remote support during workdays from 9 a.m to 5 p.m. eastern, audit trails for all published alerts, along with software patches and updates.  The estimated amount of this purchase is $5,800.00. <br>  <br> 4.	  Statutory Authority:  FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br>  <br> 5.	  The TNARNG currently has the Desktop Alert Mass Notification Software in place, and is being utilized.  If the J6 were to choose a separate maintenance and support package, it would not be compatible with the current existing software.  This would require the purchase of a new software package and maintenance/support program which could be cost prohibited and repetitious to the current system. <br>  <br> 6.	  No other efforts were made to receive quotes for this procurement.  A notice of awarding this contract as a sole source will be posted on FBO for 10 days after award. <br>  <br> 7.	  It was determined using Desktop Alert Inc. commercial catalog pricing for the annual maintenance and support that the anticipated cost for the renewal of the agreement will be fair and reasonable to the government. <br>  <br> 8.	  Market Research was conducted and it was determined that Desktop Alert Inc is the only provider of this maintenance agreement, and purchasing this agreement with the current Desktop Alert Inc. software in place is more cost effective than soliciting a brand new software/maintenance package. <br>  <br> 9.	  Letter provided by Desktop Alert, Inc as sole source vendor suggests the use of other than full and open competition. <br>  <br> 10. No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition. <br>  <br> 11. No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken as Desktop Alert Inc., is the only company that provides the support and maintenance to their software. <br>  <br> 12. This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br>  <br>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK<br /><br />Background: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) currently operates an in-house duplicating center to support all agency programs by producing multiple copies, on a quick turnaround basis of various administrative and sensitive documents that cannot be commercially procured due to time constraints and/or document sensitivity issues. Most of the jobs copied for NRC staff in the Shop require some type of bindery to complete them. Therefore, there are many smaller pieces of equipment in the shop that occasionally require maintenance service or repair on a per-call basis (List of Equipment Attached).
<p>Service Response Time:<br />Response to service calls from NRC Duplicating Center by Vendor should be as follows (at minimum)<br />&bull; 2 to 4 hours for confirmation telephone call from vendor acknowledging request for service from NRC; and<br />&bull; 4 to 8 hours from receipt of original NRC call for service to have technician on site to perform repair. Anything over 8 hour response is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Meetings and Travel<br />Only local travel is expected to and from NRC HQ Duplicating Center in Rockville, MD to deliver and install new parts, and/or to service equipment on an ongoing basis as necessary.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The period of performance is from date of contract award for 1 year with two option years.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73 Compliance With the Laws (Apr 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (Apr 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.369</p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 1000 Pacific Time on 03January2013.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ??Principal,?? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror??s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as:THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 30 DEC 13 08:00PM.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 0800 Pacific Time on&nbsp;31 December 2013.</p>
