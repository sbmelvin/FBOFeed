<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service, intends to procure services to conduct Socio-Economic Profiles of Fishers and their Communities in Western Puerto Rico.  The Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA), national Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), and Executive Order (EO) 12898 require that social impact analyses be conducted when federal agencies propose new regulations.  These analyses require the use of social and cultural baseline data for various user groups in the fishery, including descriptions of the commercial, for-hire, recreational and subsistence fishing sectors.  The objectives of the proposed work are: (1) to conduct community profiles to satisfy the legal requirements of the MSA in western Puerto Rico, and (2) to conduct a socio-economic evaluation of the performance of the seasonal closures off the west coast of Puerto Rico, namely Buoy 8/Tourmaline Bank, Buoy 6/Abrir la Sierra Bank, and Bajo de Sico.  The project components are: (1) Research Design and Methodology, (2) Review of Existing Material, (3) Quantitative Fishery Data Analysis, (4) Survey Instrument Development, (5) Office Management and Budget (OMB) Submission, (6) Fieldwork, and (7) Report Writing and Production.  Deliverables include: Research design and methodology, Survey Instruments and Interviewers Guide, Report Outline, Quarterly Progress Reports and Field Reports, End Note Annotated Bibliography, Resource Utilization Map, and Final Report with various Maps in GIS both in English and Spanish.  Criteria for Evaluation are: First-hand knowledge and demonstrated familiarity with fisheries, fishery sectors, and communities in the Caribbean; Demonstrated familiarity with theoretical and/or empirical literature regarding sociological and anthropological research on fishing communities; Previous sociological/anthropological research experience regarding fisheries in the Caribbean, preferably in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; Demonstrated ability to deliver high quality work in a timely fashion; Demonstrated familiarity with various legal mandates and agency guidelines that frame National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS') social regulatory impact analyses; Detailed working plan, describing time and resource allocation for the various tasks; and Experience in accessing and using Census data to identify and/or profile communities, using GIS and/or other graphical software to provide research results in mapping format, and using anthropological softwares such as Atlas.ti.  This will be a firm fixed-price contract.  NAICS code 541990 applies.  Solicitation Number WC133F-03-RP-0031MLW be available on or about July 29, 2003. Firms interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation shall submit a request in writing to the attention of Mamie L.Wandick at the address listed above.
