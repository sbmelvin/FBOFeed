<DESC>The Agency Of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration(SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services(CMHS),
through the Division of Acquisition Management(DAM), Program
Support Center(PSC), plans to award a 12 month sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the NASMHPD Research Insitute, Inc., 66 Canal Center Plaza, Suite, 302, Alexandria, VA 22314.  The anticipated date of award is August 28, 2003.
	
This exploratory study will implement the PPE approach in four
states.  This study will contribute to the body of knowledge on service utilization by individuals with histories of trauma, as
well as to the methodological literature on difficult-to-study populations.

This project proposes to use a wide range of medical, human services, criminal justice, and other data sets, first, to identify likely trauma victims, and second, to describe patterns of service utilization across service sectors for these trauma victims.

These periodic reports will be complimented by web-enhanced conference calls.  These conference calls will make use of emerging technology that allows for long distance group discussion with simultaneous on-line sharing of graphic data.  This technology will be used to educate participating states about the technology of PPE and to share graphic presentations of project findings.

Quarterly reports will provide SAMHSA with updates on progress, accomplishments, publications/presentations, and program
management.  A final project report will include a complete enumeration of data sets and data items used in each state, a
detailed description of the research methods, and a detailed comparison of findings across states.  The final report will also include a discussion of the interpretation of findings from the perspective of the participating states and recommendations regarding future directions for research in this area.

The contractor shall develop a project plan outlining dates for proposed meetings, selection of states, access to data sets, statistical analyses, and follow-up with states as well as other interested stakeholders.  The plan will ensure the involvement of consumers of mental health and other social services who are also trauma survivors in the planning, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination stages of this project.

In consultation with the Project Officer the contractor shall select participating states and obtain their commitment to provide access to datasets for analysis under this contract.  The contractor shall identify a contact person and conduct preliminary telephone consultations with state agencies to determine the procedures required for access to data.

The contractor shall hold a conference call of all participating states.  This meeting will introduce the project, progress to date, identify next steps, and establish timetables.  This first call will include a formal presentation of the PPE methodology.

All participating states will provide mental health treatment data sets.  The contractor shall ensure that these data sets include standard PPE data elements plus diagnosis codes, problem assessment results, and other data elements relevant to trauma and victimization.  States will also submit other relevant data sets as they become  available.  The contractor will hold a second conference call in mid-January.  Data analysis will begin.

The contractor shall prepare an overview of the project and progress report.  These will be presented to CMHS staff and other venues as deemed appropriate by the contractor and Project Officer.  The progress report shall include a discussion of data sets identified and accessed and the results of the analyses conducted to date.  At this time, other states will be invited to join the project at their own expense.  Data analysis will continue.

Participating states will continue to identify and access relevant data sets from other agencies.  States will forward data to the contractor for state-by-state analysis.  The contractor will prepare and distribute bi-monthly reports regarding data sets identified, access to data, and results of completed analyses.  Conference calls among participating states will be held in months 6 and 8.  New states identified to participate at their own expense will be included.  Data analysis will continue.

Preliminary findings and a draft final report will be prepared for presentation to CMHS staff and at national or regional meetings as deemed appropriate by the contractor and Project Officer. 

The contractor shall conduct cross-state comparisons and submit a draft final report that describes the process, methodology, and findings of this project to the Project Officer and to participating states.  The contractor shall hold a final conference call of participating states for their feedback on the draft final report.  The Project Officer will review and return comments to the contractor within 14 days of the final conference call.  The contractor shall revise and finalize the final report and submit two hard copies and an electronic copy to SAMHSA within 14 days.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the
Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source
Under authority of Far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify
their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days
after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by
the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation is available.

For further information, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03,
Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Md. 20857 or on
301-443-2475.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro Gas Analyzers (MGA).  The proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state-of-practice.  

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the area of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) implementations of MGA, with the ultimate objective being the realization of tiny separation analyzer-based chemical warfare agent (CWA) sensors capable of orders of magnitude reductions in analysis time, detection limit, and power consumption, over equivalent bench top systems, while maintaining true and false alarm rates on par with bench top gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) systems. By harnessing the advantages of micro-scale miniaturization, the MGA program is expected to yield chip-scale gas analyzers with unprecedented performance characteristics, such as (but not limited to):

(1)	An ability to identify all relevant CWA’s against plausible background mixtures of more than 30 different species, including fuels (e.g., JP8), with true and false alarm rates on par with GC/MS systems, which are the gold standard of gas analysis. Proposers are strongly encouraged to present Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve comparisons between their proposed miniature gas analyzer and present-day macro-scale implementations.
(2)	Overall size less than 2 cm cubed, not including the power source, but including control electronics and any fluid transport, preconcentration, and detection mechanisms, whichever used.
(3)	Detection limit better than 1 ppt.
(4)	Total analysis time less than 4 seconds, to include the time needed for any preconcentration, separation, and detection steps.
(5)	Energy per analysis less than 1 J (the smaller, the better).

Note that the above are merely meant to provide rough order of magnitude expectations of what is ultimately deemed possible by the end of the MGA program, and are not to be construed as rigid program specifications.

MGA realizations based on micro-scale gas chromatography and mass spectrometry are of particular interest, although other approaches capable of achieving similar performance characteristics, especially with respect to false alarm rates, will also be considered.  Fast analysis time and low power are paramount for any proposed approach, and are expected to be achievable via micro-scale miniaturization. In general, approaches that harness small size or micro-scale properties to attain better performance (e.g., lower power) are of particular interest to MGA. Research topics and activities relevant to the implementation of MGA might include, but are not limited to: (1) fast micro-scale preconcentration; (2) strategies for suppression of unwanted species; (3) micro- or nano-engineered separation methods, such as ultra-thin chromatographic columns; (4) nano-engineered stationary phases; (5) methods for fluid transport, including pumpless strategies, if possible; (6) micro-scale thermal isolation for low power operation; and (7) micro- or nano-engineered detectors with unprecedented sensitivity.

Among the more compelling drivers behind the MGA program is the need for portable CWA detectors with vastly superior false positive rates relative to present-day portable sensors, and with sizes, response speeds, and power consumptions that enable wearable-mode or projectile-deliverable applications. Part of the impetus behind the technical approach of the MGA program stems from the recognition that micro-scale miniaturization in all physical domains generally provides advantages (beyond size reduction) in speed, power consumption, and sensitivity. For example, the enhanced degree of thermal isolation achievable via MEMS implementations is expected to offer thermal resistances and capacitances that enable substantial reductions in the power consumption and analysis time. Larger surface-to-volume ratios on the micro-scale might increase the effectiveness of surface-interaction based separation methods, greatly increasing the speed of analysis. Smaller operation volumes might allow operation under conditions where smaller molecular mean free paths are acceptable, again, allowing lower power consumption. Finally, nano-scale features and engineering might raise detector sensitivity levels by orders of magnitude and may encourage arrayed approaches pursuant to enhanced selectivity. 

MGA-enabled devices with characteristics similar to that listed above and achieved via low cost, batch fabrication methods are expected to enable a myriad of strategic capabilities. In particular, the sheer portability of the CWA sensors sought by the MGA program should introduce a host of new applications and deployment scenarios, including wearable sensors for dismounted warriors, projectile-delivered sensors for remote detection applications, and unattended ground sensors for perimeter protection and advanced warning purposes. Although the small size and power consumption sought by MGA are obvious enablers for wearable CWA sensors, it is actually MGA’s pursuit of false alarm rates on par with table top GC/MS systems that makes possible this sort of “per soldier” deployment strategy, which is presently limited by the unacceptably high incidence of false positives exhibited by current fielded portable CWA sensors. In addition, the fast analysis speed and tiny size (for resilience against high g forces) targeted by the MGA program, together with miniature wireless technologies targeted by other DARPA programs (e.g., NMASP), will enable projectile-deployed MGA’s for remote detection of distant CWA’s, effectively allowing miniature point detectors to operate in a stand-off-like fashion. Furthermore, MGA-enabled low power and low false alarm rates should greatly facilitate the deployment of unattended sensor networks for first warning perimeter applications, as well as environmental monitoring applications in both military and civilian sectors. By enabling a swelling of applications, as illustrated above, miniaturization via MGA technology is expected to generate a need for high volume manufacturing that, together with wafer-level batch fabrication methods enabled by MEMS technology, should substantially lower the cost of GC/MS-equivalent systems, and thus, further fuel expansion of the application suite for MGA technology.

DARPA strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration all significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations. Teaming among academic, industrial and/or government partners is encouraged, and it is anticipated that the contributions of the team members are complementary as well as essential to the critical path of the research plan. A technology insertion plan is encouraged and research that holds promise of insertion into Department of Defense (DoD) relevance is of great interest.

PROGRAM SCOPE

The Micro Gas Analyzers program will consist of a Phase I effort (18 months) followed by an optional Phase II (18 months) and Phase III (18 months) for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD. Awards are expected to be made during the third quarter of fiscal year 2003.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase).   Multiple awards are anticipated.  The formation of multi-disciplinary teams consisting of industry, academia, and/or national laboratories with complementary areas of expertise is strongly encouraged, especially given the sub-system flavor of the MGA program. A web site—http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-03-40/ has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Clark T.-C. Nguyen, phone: (571) 218-4586, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: cnguyen@darpa.mil

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro-Electric Propulsion (MEP). Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices or systems.  Specifically excluded is research which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice.  

Space is being used to fulfill an ever increasing range of both civilian and military needs. The wide range of potential missions of interest places considerable burden upon the spacecraft designer to develop and field increasingly high performance and flexible subsystems, including propulsion systems. Further, there is increasingly a desire to deploy small satellites and spacecraft whose missions and requirements may be changed routinely throughout their operational life in support changing national needs. It is the aim of this program to enable a new generation of fast, long-lived, highly flexible, and highly maneuverable 1-100 kg-class satellites/spacecraft by demonstrating flexible, light-weight, high-efficiency, scalable micro-propulsion systems.

DARPA is soliciting proposals for the development of novel, high performance, highly flexible micro-thruster and micro-propulsion systems based upon Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) micro-colloidal propulsion technology. However, DARPA will also consider proposals based upon alternate technologies able to satisfy the program goals. These goals are to (1) demonstrate a thruster system capable of varying its specific impulse in real time across a range from 500 sec. to 10,000 sec. utilizing a single propellant, (2) operate said thrusters with electrical thrust efficiencies in excess of 90% over significant portions of this range, (3) demonstrate said thruster with a thruster specific mass less than 0.3 g/Watt, and (4) demonstrate said thruster in a propulsion system capable of delivering total mission delta-Vs for a 100 kg satellite in excess of 10 km/s. 

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 03-41 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

Services and Data to use in estimating an Output Price Index for   
New Warehouse Buildings   
  
Description and Scope of Work  
  
The Producer Price Index needs services and data to aid in estimating an output price index for New Warehouse Buildings.  These services and data are not available from public sector sources.  It is the intention of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to procure these services and data from the appropriate private sector vendor, RS Means.  
  
Services will include the application of established expertise in the economic analysis of construction industry data to assist in the implementation of pricing methodologies appropriate to complex heterogeneous warehouse building construction projects.  Data will include unit cost and quantity information for four warehouse building models.  Data will be presented in four quarterly updates for each model.  These updates will include revised labor, material, and equipment costs, as well as sub-contractor and general contractor mark-ups for each unit item specified in the models.  In addition, substitutions of new unit items will be made as changes in building practices and materials related to the four warehouse models occur in the marketplace.    
Performance Work Statement  
  
I.	Background:  
  
The Producer Price Index Program (PPI) has been funded to compile output-based price indexes for selected types of nonresidential buildings constructed in the United States.  Currently, there exists no accurate and comprehensive output price measure for the nonresidential construction sector of the US economy.  This void poses significant problems in accurately measuring the nation’s national income accounts and aggregate productivity.  The PPI will require the use of specialized data and services procured from the selected vendor to implement survey processes and methodologies for use in estimating the desired output price indexes.  
  
II. 	Scope:  
  
In FY2003 and into FY2004, the PPI Program will extend experimental survey activities to establish an output price index for new Warehouse Buildings constructed in the US.  This would include identifying the data and services that would be obtained from vendors and which data will be obtained from survey respondents.   
  
III.	Goal:  
Estimate monthly US average output price indexes for new Warehouse Buildings by implementing the appropriate sampling, pricing, and data collection methodologies.  
  
IV.	Objectives:  
  
1.	Track all cost and mark-up information for each unit item specified in four warehouse building models.   
  
2.	Identify unit specifications that are representative of current building materials and techniques used in constructing new warehouse buildings as culled from actual warehouse building project data and contacts with industry representatives.   
  
3.	Identify an efficient survey process that meets all BLS and respondent needs.  
  
4.	Identify what data are best obtained from general contractors and what data are best obtained from the special trade contractors.  
  
5.	Identify projected sample unit participation, refusal, and discontinuance rates.  
  
V.	Approach:  
  
1.	BLS has specified four warehouse models to be priced.  BLS specified the models by geographic region, building size, roof covering, framing material, and outside wall material.  
  
2.	BLS will combine mark-up data obtained from sampled survey respondents along with cost data provided by the vendor to measure output price trends for new warehouse building construction activity.  
  
3.	RS Means will conduct independent surveys specifically designed to obtain regional cost information for four assemblies selected by BLS in each of the four regional BLS warehouse models.  All other unit and assembly cost information for the models will be updated by RS Means using its City Cost Indexes (CCI) data.  The CCI for a benchmark city in each region will be selected in consultation with BLS and that CCI and will be used to update all assembly and unit price information not obtained through the independent surveys.  
  
4.	BLS will obtain new assembly/unit specification data from the vendor and apply specification changes and the appropriate quality adjustments in an on-going manner.  
  
5.	BLS will work through major construction industry trade associations to gain cooperation from general and trades contractors.  
  
VI.  Deliverables:  
  
1.	For each of the four regional BLS warehouse building models, RS Means will deliver quarterly cost updates following specifications provided by BLS.  All unit price information for each model will be updated as part of each quarterly submission.  Updates will be based on specific and independent surveys conducted by RS Means to obtain information related to the BLS models and on information adapted from the RS Means CCI data.  The updates will specify changes in the unit/specification material, cost, and quantity information to reflect on-going changes witnessed in the marketplace.  Quarterly updates of the detailed cost estimates are required for four consecutive quarters, for each specified model.  This information will be aggregated along with the appropriate CCI data to provide updated assembly, system, and model price data.

This study is an ongoing collaborative study between NIEHS and NCSU to create a database that contains the promoter regions for all of the known human genes and implementing a computational algorithm to scan for potential transcription factor binding sites in these sequences.  Pattern recognition methods will be used to identify unique transcription factor binding motifs that can distinguish between different classes of genes, e.g., G1 cell cycle genes vs G2 cell cycle genes.  NCSU possesses the expertise in gene classification and function prediction using computational techniques that is required to continue this study.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice to Elaine Shoaf at the above address or e-mail shoaf1@niehs.nih.gov for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with North Carolina State University.  The NAICS Code/Size is 541690/$6.0M.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Elaine Shoaf via email shoaf1@niehs.nih.gov.*****

<CONTACT>Lynn Salo, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-435-6962, Fax 301-402-3676, Email ls59u@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) continues to have a need for storage, monitoring and distributing blood, urine, tissue and other samples collected currently by 14 NICHD programs.  The NAICS code is 54171.  The following criteria define NICHD's requirement for the repository.  a) There are approximately 2.5 million vials of biological specimens that have been collected under various research protocols.  Storing them all will require space for 1,250,000 vials stored at -20 degrees C; 900,000 at -70 degrees C; 170,000 stored in liquid nitrogen (LN).  Currently, the government owns 24 freezers for -70 degree storage and 6 liquid nitrogen units.  Any potential Offeror would be expected to supply the additional freezer space as additional collections are added.  Over the next five years, it is estimated that the collections will need space for up to 1,400,000 vials stored at -20 degrees C; 1,750,000 vials at -70 degrees C; 215,000 in LN; total approximately 3,375,000 specimens.  All storage must be in the same or adjoining buildings not more than two minutes' walking time apart in order to ensure that any sample during transfer to another freezer is exposed for a minimal amount of time at room temperature.  Building(s) must be equipped with adequate and appropriate monitoring facilities that include back-up electrical power source(s) and alarm systems.  b) The specimens must be catalogued into a computerized inventory system that must be able to locate every sample.  The inventory system must be computer based, currently in use, demonstrated to be able to manage a repository of this size, and able to locate any specimen without the assistance of the NICHD beyond the provision of a subject ID number and date the specimen was drawn.  Since the information collected on the samples from each of the 14 programs differs, the inventory system must be able to accommodate from 3 to 25 items per specimen, including tracking data for in/out status, number of times thawed, etc.  c) Since some of the samples will require pick-up from the NIH campus, it is required that the Offeror's facility be located so that the total time between pick-up and delivery to the facility shall not exceed two (2) hours driving time of the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  d) Respondents must demonstrate capability of retrieving specimens from inventory, aliquot them into a new container, and ship them to designated locations upon request.  e) Respondents must demonstrate the capability to return to inventory all unused aliquots.  And f) Respondents must demonstrate the capability to inventory and receive new specimen into the repository.  The Request for Proposals, RFP-NIH-NICHD-2003-17 will be available on or about August 22, 2003.  All responsible organizations are encouraged to submit a proposal that will be due October 22, 2003.  This requirement is defined as code 54171 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Point of contact is Ms. Lynn Salo, Contracting Officer, e-mail; ls59u@nih.gov; address: CMB, NICHD, NIH, HHS, 6100 Executive Blvd., Room 7A07 MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-03-00351, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal  Acquisition Circular 01-15.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $6.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.   This procurement is for  the analysis of up to 96 samples of water containing either monomethyltin (MMT) or dimethyltin (DMT).  Analysis of methyltin species (MMT, DMT, and trimethyltin [TMT]) as well as total tin will be required at specific time points after preparation of the water solutions, as  specified below.  The contractor shall provide EPA with a price for the full analysis of all 96 samples.  The contractor is required to submit a pre-award Quality Management Plan consistent with the specifications contained in document EPA/QAR-2 EPA Requirements for Quality Management Plans. No  award may be given until and unless the Quality Assurance Manager and the Project Officer agree as to the conditions of that plan. EPA/QAR-2 can be downloaded from EPA's Quality Staff Home Page (http://www.epa.gov/quality) under "Documents".  The contractor is required to submit a Quality Assurance  Project Plan consistent with the conditions of document EPA/QAR-5 EPA Requirements for Quality Assurance Project Plans. The QAPP must be  submitted and approved by the QAM and the Project Officer prior to work beginning on the project but is not a pre-award condition. EPA/QAR-5 can be downloaded  from EPA's Quality Staff Home Page (http://www.epa.gov/quality) under "Documents".  Contractor shall provide laboratory testing services to the EPA in accordance with the Description of Services.  Specimens are to be collected by the EPA, and the Contractor shall arrange for shipment.  Due to the  uncertain stability of the compounds, the samples must be picked up within 15 minutes of preparation in the EPA laboratory, and analysis or stabilization (for later analysis) made within 30 minutes.  The actual specimen collections will take place over one week.  To allow for analysis verification  and post-collection analyses, the period of performance is 12 months from the date the contract is awarded. The Contractor shall designate a Study Manager and provide contact information (telephone, email, postal address).  The Study Manager shall coordinate  communications between EPA and the  Contractor analytical laboratory, supply necessary forms, and oversee execution of performance for the Contractor. Description of Services:  Analysis of the organotin concentrations (total tin and methyltin species) in drinking water studies is needed to verify dose levels used in animal studies.   Stability of two organotin compounds, monomethyl and dimethyl tin, will be measured over several days, under conditions of use equivalent to the animal study.  There will be a stock solution which will be kept in the freezer, and dilutions made from that stock will be kept in water bottles in the  animal room, suspended on empty cages.  For each solution, analysis shall be conducted immediately after preparation, 6 hours later, and again at 1, 2, 3, and 4 days, to allow a time-course for stability.  Samples of the stock will be analyzed immediately after preparation and at 2 and 4 days.    Analysis at each time point shall include actual quantity of monomethyl (MMT), dimethyl (DMT), and trimethyl tin (TMT), as well as  total tin (Sn).  The solutions will be made on a Monday, and sampling will take place each day (Friday=day 4) that week.  The Contractor is free to choose the  analytical method most appropriate for this contract.  Literature citations for this type of analysis are included in References.    However, the methodology must be capable of identifying and quantifying the methyltin species at relatively low concentrations (limits of detection no more than 0.1%  of nominal concentrations).  Recommended methods include LC or GC (requiring derivitization) followed by MS identification of species.  Numerous papers in the literature describe these methodologies (cited below).  In addition, SOPs for GC/MS analysis are available from the EPA.  The Contractor  must fully describe the proposed analytical techniques with supporting documentation of capabilities and anticipated recovery/limits of detection.  All solutions will be maintained at the EPA's Environmental Research Center laboratory in Research Triangle Park,  NC.  Water samples shall be picked  up from the EPA facility by the Contractor or courier, and delivered to the Contractor's laboratory where the assays will be performed.  Contractor shall perform the assays, verify the accuracy of the results with concurrent standard curves and control samples, and report the results, including  data from which the standard curves are derived, to the EPA in writing and electronically in the form of a PC-based spreadsheet (e.g., Excel?) or ASCII file. 1. Initial recovery / feasibility studies.  Contractor shall undertake feasibility studies to determine recovery of methyltin species in  spiked water solutions.  Recovery will be reported to EPA prior to shipping samples with unknown concentrations.   2. Stability study of water solutions.  Solutions and sampling times are listed in the table below.  Contractor shall work with EPA to determine the appropriate sample size for each  sample.  Contractor shall provide bottles for sample collection in consultation with EPA.  This actual collection of samples will take 1  week.  3. Contractor shall perform analysis for concentrations of MMT, DMT, TMT, and total tin in each water sample.  4. EPA will work with the Contractor to  schedule the stability study as described above.  5. The assays shall be conducted within 30 minutes of receipt at the analytical laboratory.  Alternatively, the samples may be stabilized immediately for later analysis.  Final analysis shall be conducted within 2 weeks and results of the assays  shall be reported by Contractor to the EPA project officer.  The results shall include:  a. Values obtained for the recovery and quantitation of methyltin species, including limits of detection.  b. A table listing the water sample number and the calculated concentration of each methyltin and total  tin in mg/L, as well as results of control samples run in the analytical laboratory for verification of accuracy of the assay.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.  Evaluation criteria  to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES CRITERIA:  a)  Provide a copy of the Quality Management Plan in accordance with the Statement of Work.  b)  Describe the proposed analytical techniques with supporting documentation of capabilities and  anticipated recovery/limits of detection.  c)  Ability to meet time line for the project; (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE:  Provide 3 references (quality of product or service, timeliness of performance (ability to adhere to deadlines), and overall customer satisfaction); and (iii) PRICE.

<DESC>70-U.S. Dept. Of Commerce Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), intends to procure on sole source basis the Executive Project software from CONFIDA FL, Inc. 1909 Harrison Street, Suite 209, Hollywood, FL 33020. MBDA proposed to contract with CONFIDA, a software company, to purchase its  "Executive Project" software product and accompanying services.  CONFIDA, " is a web-based monitoring and reporting tool bringing panoramic project oversight and control capabilities to the fingertips of the busy executive."  
The Executive Project software is a tool that MBDA uses to:

A. Evaluate baseline performance of its funded programs/projects/initiatives more effectively through early warning signals and crucial project information,
B. Focus on progress, priorities and key statistics of MBDA programs.  This feature will improve the timeliness and quality of reporting to MBDA stakeholders,
C. Obtain effective feedback from stakeholders through its Action Box feature,
D. Provide for improved project management and team decision making and more timely adjustments to project feedback,
E. Improve in allocating Agency resources to funded projects,
F. Receive project guidance from CONFIDA's Project Leadership Consultants. 
G. Received hands on monitoring of operating system from CONFIDA's staff The Executive Project solution offers the software and the coaching/guidance on  key projects.  This software is used to monitor projects and give managers the advice to make the project successful and then the company gives manager's a ‘heads up' on the issues that they need to be aware of.  The second point is project management, the program is designed to support Executive and Management decisions. The third distinction is the consulting/training. They will combine traditional training with ‘targeted coaching' on the actual projects that employees are managing.  Furthermore, because the system allows this company to monitor the projects remotely, they can coach and train remotely via e-mail and phone which allows them to have an impact but at a much reduced cost.  See note 22

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Genetics Branch (GB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Myriad Genetic Laboratories Inc., 320 Wakara Way, Salt Lake city, UT 84108, for the continued molecular diagnostic testing for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 using its patented BRACAnalysis.  The Clinical Cancer Genetics Program within the Genetics Branch, CCR, NCI, is dedicated to the study of the causes and consequences of cancer-associated genetic instability.  The goal is to determine the distinctive versus unifying themes among several types of genetic instability implicated in carcinogenesis and associated clinical implications.  This contract will be used to perform genetic testing for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.  Full gene sequencing is the method employed on a clinical basis and is the most sensitive testing widely available thus far to identify mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.  Sequencing is performed in both forward and reverse directions of all coding exons and adjacent base pairs in the non-coding intervening sequences.  In addition, this analysis includes testing for the five specific large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1. Since this is a continuation of ongoing research it is imperative that Myriad Genetic Laboratories perform these tests as not to introduce new variables and maintain comparability across tests done at different times.  This service is considered commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.   However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, without introducing new variables into an ongoing experiment it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 22, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS 541380.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>A notice will be posted AM of 7/28/03 extending the RFP closing date to 8/22/03 COB 3:30PM.  The reason for the RFP extension is that the MEO Certifying Official requires more time for review due to schedule conflicts.  Further, the MEO and Management Plan developer is required to explain all submissions prior to MEO certification. Until this is accomplished the IRO cannot reivew the entire package for certification and approval to the contracting officer.  Therefore, an ammendment will be issued to extend the RFP closing date.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the previous notice is to incorporate Questions & Answers to this RFQ as follows;
Questions & Answers -Reference No. 03-856-4202

1).   The above synopsis posted on June 9, 2003 states that for safety, NIST requires that Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. must certify the equipment.  This unit is a custom made unit to NIST specs.  The cost of getting UL approval on this type of unit could exceed the cost of the unit itself.  Most UL approvals are for mass produced products so the cost can be spread out over a large number of pieces.  In our long history of fabricating wet process equipment for the semiconductor industry this requirement has never been requested.  We use UL approved components whenever possible.  Has NIST required this certification and received it on similar pieces of equipment in the past?  We look forward to your reply.
 
Answer:   It would be sufficient to amend the safety statement to say that NIST requires that the fume hood with acid workbench shall be made from UL-approved components.  Since the requirement shall be made from a number of UL-approved components, NIST does not expect Contractors to get UL certification for the entire system.  

All other information remains the same.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Fume Hood with Acid Workbench
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-03-856-4202

<CONTACT>Lisa Sawyer, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-3840, Fax 301-975-2541, Email lisa.sawyer@nist.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to address the following Questions for PR#03-856-4202;

Questions & Answers - Part 2 - 
Fume Hood with Acid Workbench

1)	Question:  Construction - The specifications call for the unit to be constructed of Polypropylene interior and PVDF exterior and the Temp Bath constructed of Fire retardant Polypropylene.  The cost of PVDF is very high and I want to confirm the exterior material (polypropylene exterior would be much less expensive).  Would NIST consider a polypropylene exterior?  

Answer:  Yes, we would consider polypropylene for the exterior of the hood.


2)	Question:  Temperature Bath - do you want this to be temperature controlled or is room temperature sufficient (no heat needed)?

Answer:   temperature bath must be temperature controlled and capable of going to temperatures up to 150 degrees C.

3)	Question:  Dump Rinser - Do you have a specific vendor & model # for the unit requested?  
If so, please provide?

Answer:   NIST is not requiring a specific vendor or model number for the dump rinser.   
NIST does require the dump rinser to meet our specifications.

4)	Question:  Ability to change from Fume Hood to Laminar Flow - 
Two Options, with estimated CFM requirements 
a)	Vendor can provide an on/off switch, which will activate the motor/blower and create laminar flow.  NIST will need to have an adjustable exhaust fan (CFM) to handle the added airflow created when the laminar flow is used (fume hood with no laminar flow will require approx. 700 CFM, with laminar flow maybe 1400 CFM).
b)	The other option, Vendor can install damper system that will create laminar flow with the exhaust.  Exhaust fan CFM requirement will be approximately 1400.
	
Answer:  It would be preferable to have the vendor provide the damper system (option b) since the vendor is more familiar with the specifics of that particular hood.  NIST can provide a fan capable of exhausting 1400 CFM.

<DESC>Questions and Answers:


1)  	Q - What is the anticipated time frame from awarding of the contract to implementation?
	A - As soon as possible, exact timing to be determined upon review of all proposals.

2)	Q - Does the State Department have access to all of the news feeds that need monitoring, or is it up to the service provider to obtain these feeds?
	A - The service provider needs to obtain these feeds.  A list of the feeds to be covered by the contractor must be included in the proposal.

3)	The RFP states: "The service shall provide accurate transcription of monitored broadcasts."  
Q - Is this transcript to be in the original language of broadcast, in English, or both?
	A - The transcript is to be in the original language.  A textual translation of this transcript must also be provided.

4)  	The RFP states: "Transcripted text shall be matched to streaming audio/video of broadcasts."  
Q - Is the language of this transcripted text English or the originating language?  Please define what you mean by matched. 
	A - The transcript is in the original language.  The translation is in English.  Matched means that when a search is conducted for a reference in the database, the clip, the transcript, and the translation should appear together.

5)  	The RFP states: "The system also shall provide accurate and comprehensible English translation of transcripts of selected non-English broadcasts in at least three languages, including Arabic."  
Q - By "selected," does that mean not all non-English broadcasts need to be translated into English?  Who will make the "selection?"
	A - "Selected" refers to those broadcasts that the contractor has proposed to provide service for.  The contractor must select a minimum of six channels to cover for this service.  For each of those six channels, the contractor must select at least two hours of programming per day to cover for this service.  Among those broadcasts that the contractor proposes to cover, three must be in languages other than English, one of which must be Arabic.  All non-English broadcasts that a contractor proposes to cover must be translated into English.  Those broadcasts that a contractor intends to cover must be expressly declared in the proposal.  Like all other aspects of a contract, should the contractor decide to change any of those broadcasts which they provide service for, such a change must first be negotiated with the Department of State.

6)  	The RFP States: "Playback of audio/video and retrieval of corresponding transcription and English translation."
	Q - Please explain what you mean by "retrieval of corresponding transcription."
	A - When a database search is conducted, the video clip, along with its corresponding transcript and translation, should all "pop-up" together.

7) 	The RFP states: "For evaluation purposes, technical merit will be weighted more heavily than price related factors."
	Q - In the overall evaluation scheme, is there a more precise breakdown of how much more heavily technical merit will be weighted relative to price?
	A - The relative weight of technical merit to price-related factors is approximately 70% to 30%.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Administrative Operations Service, Division of Acquisition Management, on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families, Children’s Bureau, Office on Child Abuse and Neglect (OCAN), plans to extend the final option period for Contract Number 100-99-0031 by eight months—through May 30, 2005.  Under this contract, which was awarded September 1999, PaL-Tech, Inc. has conducted the 13th (April 2001) and 14th (March/April 2003) National Conferences on Child Abuse and Neglect on behalf of OCAN.  During the final option period, PaL-Tech will complete the majority of the planning and logistics including securing the venue for the 15th National Conference, which is scheduled for April 2005.  Currently, the final option period will end September 2004.  It would be inefficient and impractical to engage another contractor after September 2004 to complete the final planning tasks and execute such a large-scale conference (more than 2000 attendees and more than 250 speakers).  PaL-Tech is the only known source with the intimate knowledge of the processes involved in planning and conducting the National Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect.  PaL-Tech maintains extensive databases of invitees/participants and speakers as well as of the national child and family-serving organizations with whom OCAN partners for these conferences.  In conjunction with OCAN, PaL-Tech has developed a range of systems for use in planning and conducting the national conference including the processes for the call for papers; the review and selection of conference abstracts; the identification and selection of commissioned papers; the contracting and logistics for invited keynote, plenary, and workshop speakers; the registration of participants; and the nomination and selection of awardees for the ACYF Commissioner’s, and other special awards presented during the conference.  PaL-Tech also has developed a comprehensive process for working with OCAN to identify and select a conference venue, locate and work with a local host agency at the site, and arrange for special conference-related experiential learning opportunities to supplement and complement the more than 200 pre-conference seminars, plenary sessions, workshops, skills seminars, roundtables and poster sessions.  The activities to be conducted during the eight-month extension will require an established protocol, which is necessary to implement and coordinate the already planned for conference and to provide guidance to OCAN to build on the outcomes of the conference program for future training and technical assistance activities.  In addition, in order to secure the appropriate venue, PaL-Tech must sign a contract with a venue immediately.  An eight-month extension of the final option period will allow PaL-Tech to secure the most appropriate conference site and to obtain insurance coverage to indemnify the company against any potential conference cancellations.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<SUBJECT>A--TEAMING OPPORTUNITY NO. 4 FOR THE MISSION AND SCIENCE MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY - 2004 (MSMT-2004) NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (NRA)
<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop proposals for the Mission and Science Measurement Technology - 2004 (MSMT-2004) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released NASA Research Announcement (NRA-03-OAT-01) entitled, "Mission and Science Measurement Technology - 2004" (see: http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_r/open.cfm).  The MSMT theme seeks proposals for exploratory research and technology development in the Enabling Concepts and Technologies (ECT) Program,  which defines new system concepts and develops new technologies to enable scientific measurements in support of the Aerospace Technology Enterprise mission.  The ECT program explores revolutionary aerospace systems, and performs fundamental research and development of high-payoff technologies.  Program objectives are to identify, develop, and transfer breakthrough technologies that have broad potential across many types of systems to provide increased scientific return at lower cost, and to enable missions and capabilities beyond current horizons.  The ECT program is on the front end of the enabling technology pipeline that supplies the focused technology development programs of the NASA Enterprises.   This NRA solicits technologies in three major areas: 1) Advanced Measurement and Detection Technology; 2) Large Aperture Technology; and 3) Low Power Microelectronics Technology.  These three technology areas can be viewed in greater detail via the NRA cite noted above. The ECT program primarily focuses on early stage technologies at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL's) of between 1 and 3, unless otherwise noted in the NRA. (For definitions of TRL's, see Appendix B of the NASA Technology Plan at http://technologyplan.nasa.gov).  The technology requirements guide future development of component and subsystem technologies, with emphasis on efficiency, miniaturization, integration, and resiliency.  The goal is to capture innovative ideas from the external community, to leverage emerging technologies, and to complement NASA capabilities in critical areas.  Successful proposals must outline a well-structured program (for up to three years) for development culminating in a proof-of-concept demonstration at TRL 3-4 by the end of the effort for both the Advanced Measurement and Detection Technology and Large Aperture Technology. (NOTE: The Low Power Microelectronics Technology area requires that proposed activities have an entry TRL of 3 or 4 and that the activity demonstrate a minimum TRL 5 at the end of the proposed activity.) NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the ECT Program to develop proposals and execute proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation. Subject to the availability of funds, selected proposal(s) would result in proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide proof of concept development and/or component breadboard validation consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criterion evaluates the proposers' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development, and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control This criterion evaluates the proposers' ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposers' facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria.  In all cases, the responder must indicate on the cover page of the proposal (not part of 5-page allocation) the technology area (see below) that applies to their proposal. All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: Greg Manuel, Mail Stop 469, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: g.s.manuel@larc.nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB August 29, 2003. Procurement questions should be directed to Tom Weih, NASA Office of Procurement, 757-864-3878; Carl.T.Weih@larc.nasa.gov Technical questions should be addressed to each of the technical points of contact indicated below for each technical area. The following LaRC technology proposals are seeking partnerships.  (1) Custom Fabricated Optical Waveguides, Splitters & Bragg Couplers, Technical Point of Contact: Joseph Zawodny, (757) 864-2681, Joseph.M.Zawodny@nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is actively planning and developing a variety of sensors to measure temperature, moisture, and chemical composition of planetary atmospheres from space based satellites. These measurements will be made by a variety of instruments including but not limited to Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) instruments and advanced radiometers. Measurements of infrared absorption in planetary atmospheres will be made by the techniques of solar and stellar occultation.  To achieve these goals NASA would like to develop advanced optical components that operate initially at wavelengths between 0.7 and 2.5 micrometers. These components are to be combined and fabricated as a single monolithic unit. The Center is therefore seeking partners with which to develop these components and/or evaluate their performance. Particular requirements include: ·  Ability to fabricate custom "optical chips" containing a combination of high-performance optical waveguides, splitters, Bragg gratings or couplers, and circulators operating in the 0.7 to 2.5 micrometer spectral range ·  Ability to control the efficiency and uniformity of component elements to a high degree ·  Low-Cost, Quick-Turnaround fabrication and/or evaluation for iterative system optimization ·	Evaluation of the radiometric performance and uniformity of devices or systems at the 0.1% level The technologies solicited include (but are not necessarily limited to) design and small lot fabrication of the devices and/or performance characterization services. Partners selected under this synopsis would participate in the development of a proposal to the anticipated NASA Mission Science and Measurement Technology 2004 Research Announcement. (2) Development of Fiber Laser Transmitter Technology, Technical Point of Contact: Keith Murray, (757) 864-1614, Keith.E.Murray@nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners for the development of fiber laser transmitter technology for planetary and Earth remote sensing LIDAR applications.  Partners interested in developing fiber laser transmitter systems that feature high wall plug efficiency and long operational life with high pulse energy/narrow pulse width capabilities at a variety of pulse repetition intervals are encouraged to apply.	Scalable and tunable systems are of particular interest.  When mature, these technologies will enable a number of novel planetary and Earth science remote sensing measurements that will greatly improve our understanding of the solar system and our home planet.	Partners selected under this synopsis would participate in the development of a proposal to the anticipated NASA Mission Science and Measurement Technology 2004 Research Announcement.

<DESC>Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs) Health Insurance Program: Introduction: Peace Corps is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis from qualified prospective vendors to provide Post-Service Health Insurance coverage for Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs), similar what is available under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Temporary Continuation of Coverage (FEHB/TCC – 5 U.S.C. 8905a). Statement of Work: All RPCVs shall be enrolled at end of their Peace Corps service, regardless of length of service. Peace Corps will pay the first month’s premium for the RPCV and eligible dependent children under age 18. Background: All Peace Corps Volunteers undergo extensive  medical screening prior to service. Conditions determined to be traceable to their Peace Corps service, as well as pre-existing conditions determined to be aggravated, accelerated or precipitated by service, are covered under the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA). While outside the United States, all Peace Corps Volunteers are considered “employed” 24 hours a day, 7 days per week for the purpose of access to FECA benefits. All conditions determined to be service-related by the Department of Labor, with or without associated disability, are eligible for FECA benefits as the primary payer. Within the first 180 days after service, Peace Corps pays for evaluation of any medical conditions which are unresolved at the Volunteer’s end of service. At the end of his or her service, each Volunteer receives a physical examination or receives an authorization for payment for a physical examination. Approximately 3,500 Volunteers close service annually; ongoing enrollment in the existing RPCV Post-Service Health Insurance Plan is approximately 7,000. Age distribution of Volunteers and Trainees: 20-29: 5512; 30-39: 592; 40-49: 151; 50-59: 235; 60-65: 104; Over 65: 84. Gender Distribution: Male: 2619; Female: 4059. (As reported as of 01 OCT 2002). Minimum Requirements of the RPCV Post-Service Health Insurance Program: 1. Major medical up to $1,000,000. 2. No pre-existing condition exclusions or restrictions for conditions that emerge during Peace Corps service. A wait time may be acceptable for non-acute, non-debilitating conditions that  pre-date entry into Peace Corps service. 3. Mental Health Parity Act compliant. 4. No increase in premiums or deductibles and no change in coverage for the first year of performance of the contract. 5. The contract is to be a one year Base Period with four one year Option Periods (FAR 52.217-9: 60 days notice prior to execution of option; anticipated duration is 60 months or Five years total). 6. Changes in costs, coverage and terms must be proposed for the option periods and will be evaluated. 7. Coverage is to be available for 18 months after service. 8. Guaranteed issuance to all eligible Volunteers, spouses and minor dependents, effective midnight on the date the Volunteer ends his or her service. 9. Provides coverage worldwide, including all 50 states. 10. Provides emergency medical evacuation to the United States or the closest adequate facility. 11. Premiums, deductibles and co-payments that meet or exceed the benefits requirements of a FEHB/TCC plan. 12. Program ensures that eligibility and portability are consistent with all provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). 13. Subrogation: Insurance plan is a primary payer of benefits. However, upon any recovery made by a participant from any third party or parties whether by suit, judgment, settlement, compromise or otherwise, the plan shall be entitled to reimbursement to the extent of benefits paid (for example, by FECA). 14. Administration of the RPCV Post-Service Health Insurance Program: The program shall impose minimum administrative burden upon Peace Corps. As this is essentially a commercial product offered to private citizens, vendors are expected to provide for administrative support, marketing, documentation and general management of the program. Peace Corps strives to achieve effective transitional health benefits for former Volunteers. Peace Corps will pay the premium for the initial 30 days of coverage for all RPCVs (including those who do not elect to continue their insurance coverage at their own expense thereafter); all subsequent premiums must be elected and paid by the individual RPCV. The prospective vendor shall emphasize simplicity in management with respect to eligibility, enrollment, financial transactions between Peace Corps and the insurer and claims processing. The prospective vendor shall work with Peace Corps to implement and administer the RPCV Health Insurance Program. There will be no printed version of this RFP.  The latest versions of the following FAR section 52 series of clauses are hereby incorporated by reference and are available at “www.arnet.gov/far/farqueryframe.html”: 52.202-1 Definitions; 52.203-3 Gratuities; 52.203-5 Covenant Against Contingent Fees; 52.203-7 Anti-Kickback Procedures; 52.203-12 Limitation on Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions; 52.204 Administrative Matters – Provisions & Clauses; 52.209-6 Protecting the Government’s Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended or Proposed for Debarment; 52.215 Contracting by Negotiation – Provisions & Clauses; 52.215-2 Audit & Records – Negotiation; 52.219-8 Utilization of Small Business Concerns; 52.222 Application of Labor Laws to Government Acquisitions – Provisions & Clauses; 52.222-1 Notice to the Government of Labor Disputes; 52.222-3 Convict Labor; 52.222-4 Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act – Overtime Compensation; 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity; 52.222-29 Notification of Visa Denial; 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.223-6 Drug-Free Workplace; 52.224-2 Privacy Act; 52.227-1 Authorization and Consent; 52.227-2 Notice and Assistance Regarding Patent and Copyright Infringement; 52.229-3 Federal, State, and Local Taxes; 52.229-5 Taxes – Contracts Performed in U.S. Possessions or Puerto Rico; 52.229-6 Taxes – Foreign Fixed-Price Contracts; 52.230-2 Cost Accounting Standards; 52.230-3 Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices; 52.230-6 Administration of Cost Account Standards; 52.232 Contract Financing – Provisions & Clauses; 52.232-8 Discount for Prompt Payment; 52.232-17 Interest; 52.232-23 Assignment of Claims; 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer – Central Contractor Registration; 52.233-1 Disputes; 52.242-13 Bankruptcy; 52.243 Contract Modifications – Provisions & Clauses; 52.245-4 Government Furnished Property (Short Form); 52.246-4 Inspection of Services – Fixed Price; 52.247-63 Preference for U.S.-Flag Air Carriers; 52.249 Termination of Contracts – Provisions & Clauses; 52.249-2 Termination for Convenience of the Government (Fixed Price); 52.249-8 Default (Fixed Price Supply and Service); 52.252 Solicitation Provisions & Contract Clauses; 52.252-6 Authorized Deviations in Clauses.

<DESC>Cataloger's Desktop on the Web
		
1.  Background
The Library of Congress (LOC) Cataloging Distribution Service (CDS) is required to convert its quarterly CD-ROM-based cataloging documentation product, Cataloger's Desktop, to online access via the World Wide Web. Cataloger's Desktop provides access to a large number of electronic manuals and procedural documentation that describe standards for performing cataloging and classification tasks in a library. The product is used by staff at LOC as well as by many library professionals and para-professionals worldwide. LOC staff is located in three buildings on Capitol Hill. A very small number of LOC staff are located at remote sites: Taylor St. (Washington, D.C.) and six Overseas Field Offices. Additionally, this product has users in the library field nationally and internationally. 
2.  Scope
The Contractor shall develop a web-based delivery system for Cataloger's Desktop using NextPageJ LivePublish. The system must be updatable on a quarterly basis. The web application must use the current Cataloger's Desktop CD-ROM product as a beginning point for interface and functionality design.  The Contractor is encouraged  to enhance Cataloger's Desktop for web delivery. The web-based application must be capable to accept updates by CDS staff.  The accompanying customer management system must have the ability to be administered by the CDS staff. The deliverable shall become the property of LOC.  It shall also be accessible to LOC staff, and national and international users. 
3.  General Requirements
3.1 	Components of Cataloger's Desktop on the web
The Contractor shall create Cataloger=s Desktop on the web as two components: an information delivery system based on the latest release of NextPageJ LivePublish; and a customer management system that enables CDS staff to manage subscription- and access-information for individual subscribers of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web. The latter will include a customer interface that enables subscribers to click through and accept a license, as well as update customer records for changes in email addresses, local system administrators, or customer-specific configuration issues. The final product must comply with Section 508 to assure web accessibility.

3.2.	Design Prototypes
The Contractor shall prepare in consultation with CDS a maximum of three design prototypes for the overall look and feel of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web. Each prototype will include at least one query template. CDS will evaluate and select the preferred design. 
	3.3	Target Audience
The targeted audience is library staff working in cataloging areas. It is projected that Cataloger=s Desktop on the web will be used by approximately 5,000 librarians at roughly 1,000 institutions. 400 users will be LOC staff while approximately 4,600 users will be subscribers who have purchased Cataloger=s Desktop from CDS. The job position, educational level, and computer experience of prospective users can vary tremendously. Professional library staff may have a masters degree in library science while library technicians may have high school diplomas. Although the targeted user community is international, the Contractor will not be required to design Cataloger=s Desktop on the web for every type of end-user computer platform. The language of the product shall be English. 
3.4	Estimated hours
It is estimated that the Contractor shall be able to accomplish the tasks in approximately 400 work hours, by working approximately 6-8 hours per week, at the Library of Congress. It is anticipated that in addition to the hours spent by the Contractor, LOC staff will contribute approximately 600 hours of work to the project. Cataloger=s Desktop on the web must be ready for launched within 6 months of contract award.
4.  Hardware/software Requirements
4.1	Software
The Library of Congress has selected FolioViews 4.4 (AFolio@) as the standard tool for creating and maintaining the source files for Cataloger=s Desktop. The files shall be received by CDS as WordPerfect 8.0+ or MS Word files and converted and content-enriched by CDS staff to Folio Infobase format (NFO) using the current release of FolioViews. LOC's long-term goal is to migrate the content-enriched infobases to XML when suitable web delivery applications become available. In the meantime, LOC has selected the current release of LivePublish from NextPageJ to deliver Cataloger=s Desktop on the web. The Contractor-developed LivePublish application must have the ability to accept FolioViews 4.x infobase files in native format. If file processing is required to incorporate infobases in the LivePublish day one product or quarterly updating, the Contractor shall develop this processing software. Such processing software must be structured so that it can be run by LOC staff in a production environment and must  not be more complex than the current release of FolioViews Workbench. 
4.2	Platform
The minimum platform for LOC staff and CDS customers of Cataloger=s Desktop is as follows:
$	Netscape 4.78, 128 bit encryption; or
$	Internet Explorer 5.5 (Javascript enabled)
4.3	Customer Management System
The Contractor must provide a customer management system that will enable CDS staff to manage subscription- and access-information for individual customers of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web. Subscription duration and numbers of simultaneous users per subscription must be administered solely by CDS staff. This customer management system must also enable customers to click-through and accept a license, as well as update their customer record for changes in email addresses, local system administrators, or customer-specific configuration issues. 
4.4	Server 
The Contractor shall recommend the location of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web and its customer management system. If Cataloger=s Desktop on the web is located on either the Contractor=s or a third party=s server, CDS will purchase a product-specific domain name.  That name will be used for the product. If Cataloger=s Desktop on the web resides on an LOC server, the product will have a sub-domain of  the LOC web domain (such as http://desktop.loc.gov). 
The ITS technical staff will be available to provide guidance to the Contractor on all server requirements.
5.  Specific Requirements
5.1	Project Plan
			The project plan created by the Contractor shall lay out a well-defined project schedule steps, deliverables, intermediate tasks, that describes development milestones, and resources. It shall focus on the responsibilities assigned to the Contractor, which will incorporate advice on content, CDS=s responsibility, where necessary. It must be delivered to LOC within eight (8) workdays from the date of contract award. 	

5.2 	CD-ROM Product Description
Appendix A: Cataloger=s Desktop on CD-ROM Product Description focuses on the existing CD-ROM product available in FolioViews 4.4 infobase format. The Contractor will examine the content to determine the need to be re-purposed for presentation on the web. 
C	Recommendations for the conversion of the existing content for web delivery.
C	Suggestions on methods and techniques for adding enhanced access and functionality to the web-based product.
5.3	Design Document
The design document shall provide the overall design for Cataloger=s Desktop on the web developed from this statement of work. It shall include the following:
C	Three (3) design prototypes; these prototypes will include the user interface and representative functionality and must include at least 1 query template; these prototypes are the property of CDS
C	CDS evaluates the prototypes and selects one. The selected prototype will then be used as the basis for Cataloger=s Desktop on the web.
5.4	Cataloger=s Desktop on the web - Specific Requirements
Cataloger=s Desktop on the web must be developed using the latest release of NextPageJ LivePublish. The product must be designed with end-user usability as central to its design approach. Cataloger=s Desktop on the web must be updatable by CDS staff on at least a quarterly basis. This updating must be accomplished by either the direct loading of Folio infobase files, or by washing Folio infobase files through a simple production software routine. The Cataloger=s Desktop on the web design must also be modular so that additional files can be added easily for new releases of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web when necessary. 
The LivePublish-based information system must not employ proprietary plug-ins or extensions that may not be supportable in subsequent releases of LivePublish unless waived by the Library. If waived by the Library, Contractor must explain steps taken to ensure no compatibility, security or upgrade issues will result.
Cataloger=s Desktop on the web must be fully viewable by all major browsers, specifically Netscape 4.78 or higher, and Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher. 
The Cataloger=s Desktop product has quarterly updates to keep the standard documents and manuals it contains current. The structure of the product is stable and its appearance does not change dramatically very often. However, we must be able to update Cataloger=s Desktop on the web as needed (at least quarterly) to incorporate any changes to the product. 
The Cataloger=s Desktop on the web delivery package shall include: 
3.	User interface designed with optimal usability as its focal-point.
4.	Software to convert Folio infobase files to be compatible with LivePublish without losing their native content enrichment.  This conversion software must be structured so that it can be run by LOC staff in a production environment and must be no more complex to run than the current release of FolioViews Workbench. 
5.	The latest release of NextPageJ LivePublish development and server software.
6.	Creation of a pilot version of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web for Ahands-on@ testing inside and outside of LOC. The Apilot version@ of Cataloger=s Desktop on the web is a segment of the product that contains all the technical capabilities used in the entire product.
