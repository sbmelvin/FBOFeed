<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), Pittsburgh, PA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Beckman Coulter, Inc., Clinical Diagnostic Division, 520 Madison Ave., 9th Floor, New York, NY  10022 for a Chemistry Automation System consisting of Power Processor (Part #A23226); Chem Xpress (Part #A11037); Stockyard, 3000 Tube (Part #A23233); Secondary Decapper (Part #6707343); Recapper (Part #A23236); and Dxl Connector (Part #A23230).  The current Chemistry analyzers used at the VAPHS University Drive Division are exclusively Beckman Coulter, Inc. Chemistry analyzers.  This population of analyzers represents a significant Capital Expenditure investment by the VAPHS.  Consequently, the option of changing to the instrumentation of another vendor is not a justifiable expenditure.  Other critical and unique features in Performance and Functionality supporting this sole source acquisition from Beckman Coulter, Inc. for its Automation Line are as follows:  1)  The existing LX20s Chemisitry and DxI Immunochemistry analyzers can only be connected to the BCI Automation Line because no other Automation vendors have contacted BCI to develop their interface capabilities related to Automation.  2)  Unique Single Point of Entry for muliple tube loading of Automation Inlet with STAT interrupt capability. 3)  Sample Log-In - "receive sample into Lab LIS" at first bar code reader.  4)  Ability to sort "unspun" samples - Hematology, Coagulation, Urines.  5)  Ability for one centrifuge to spin up to 350 sample tubes per hour.  5)  If necessary, ability to "bypass" the centrifuge for samples already spun.  6)  Physical "hookup" to BCI chemistry and immunochemistry instruments.  7)  Experience with USVA, VISTA LIS for interfacing to instrumentation and Automation. 8)  DL2000 Data Manager with elaborate and customized decision rules.  9)  Abilitiy to network DL2000s/Middleware to view results from all instruments at any DL2000.  10) "Back end" 3060 tube refrigerated stockyard units available for stroage and automatic retrieval of samples.  11) Outlet units availablel for sorting "send-outs" and other off-line testing workstations.  12) Significant population of BCI Automation Installed Base (over 250 placements) throughout USA.  13)  Over 750 dedicated Service/Application reps.  and 14) Proven and independently documented Open System - 7 vendors and 16 different models.  If your firm has chemistry automation equipment which can meet all the above requirements, please submit supporting information to Linda Glancy@med.va.gov or to Linda Glancy (04A-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA  15206 NLT 9/15/05 COB.

The equipment is to be delivered to USDA, FSIS, Western Laboratory, Alameda, CA. The Brinkman/Eppendorf Liquid Handling System meets our minimum specifications necessary to accomplish the required laboratory tasks. There are twelve (12) deck spaces the lab will be able to run two analyses at once. The Eppendorf model also comes equipped with a control module which takes place of a dedicated computer system. This will make it easier for us to place the liquid handler in a lab with limited bench space. The Eppendorf is the only model that comes with a liquid level sensor which, along with measuring solvent levels, can detect missing tips. This makes it possible to use tip racks that are only partially full. All responsible sources who can provide the above requirement shall submit written quotations within five (5) days from the published date of this announcement. No solicitation will be issued, therefore such requests for solicitations will be considered non responsive. All quotes shall include price(s); FOB Point; a POC (Name and Telephone Number); GSA Number if applicable; business size and payment terms. Quotes are acceptable by fax to 301/504-4276 or by email to deborah.robertson@fsis.usda.gov.

<DESC>The Los Angeles Air Force Base, Space and Missile Systems Center, 61st Contracting Squadron (61 CONS) intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed priced, services contract with ACCO Engineered Systems, 6565 San Fernando Road, Glendale, CA 91201-2214 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The contract will provide seamless support for the complex HVAC control system for the new System Acquisition Management Support Complex (SAMS). ACCO has been selected on the basis of their affiliation with the HVAC controller manufacturer, Automated Logic Corp. The HVAC designer is ACCO. This acquisition is between $100,000 and $250,000. The NAICS code is 238220. The small business size standard is $12.0M. This solicitation consists of one line item- Item 0001: 1 Lot; Commission, Test, and Air Balance HVAC System in Bldg 270 and Bldg 271. Project Description: The HVAC systems in B270 & B271is very complex.  The HVAC design is a combination of three systems.  One part provides massive regulated airflow to three floors, distributing bulk air throughout the building under the floor; another regulates airflow at the building perimeter; a third provides air through ducting to specific rooms or areas.  The air temperature of all three systems is controlled dynamically by real time computer monitoring and controls links to air valves, fans, water pumps, heaters and chillers.  To balance a system this complex requires a steep learning curve for someone other than the designer/installer, ACCO.  The HVAC controller manufacturer, Automated Logic Corp, provides specialized equipment to interface between the test monitoring laptop computer and the HVAC controller.  ACCO is the local distributor for ALC. The HVAC system is controlled by proprietary software.  The software must be linked with a network provided by the COMM Squadron upon completion of air balance testing.  The network is capable of monitoring buildings real time.   SAMS Monitoring data must be downloaded into an existing database that contains HVAC information for the Fitness Center and the CDC.  The use of control monitoring software other than that provided by ACCO cannot be guaranteed compatible in content and format when downloading. Changes to control setting and adjustments involve changes in computer code settings.   ACCO, as the system designer, is most familiar with B270 & B271 HVAC requirements, design goals and test strategies to accomplish those goals.

Description

The purpose of this announcement is to inform potential sources of changes to the Global Positioning System (GPS) Modernized User Equipment (MUE) Receiver Card Development Program. This announcement is one of several, which attempts to keep potential sources informed of the various programmatic changes.






The MUE Receiver Card Development Program will attempt to release another full or partial draft RFP no later than five (5) days from this notice.  Interested sources (primes or subcontractors) who have not previously responded should respond to this announcement.  Additionally, interested sources should request access to this information through the established website.  See paragraph entitled, “RFP ACCESS”.   

System Description: The MUE Program is the User Segment component of the GPS modernization effort.  The objective of the MUE Program is to design, develop, fabricate, and document two YMCA receiver cards and their required internal support components based on the GPS Receiver Applications Module SEM-E/Modernized (GRAM-S/M) and Ground-based GPS Receiver Applications Module - Modernized Small Serial Interface (GB-GRAM-M-SSI).  These requirements are available at the GPS website.  Instructions on how to access this website are presented at the end of this announcement.  The receiver cards will demonstrate the ability to receive and process the MUE signal as well as validate the Protection of Navigation (PRONAV) security architecture.  Support for the demonstration into the aviation receiver card in a Line Receiver Unit (LRU) is covered under this effort.    

The MUE Receiver Program does not include production.  It is anticipated that MUE receiver card procurements will be conducted by platform managers for MUE specific to a platform or by the Services to meet Service-wide needs.
To assist respondents in understanding the potential scope of this effort the following program objectives are provided as reference:

The primary objective of this contract is to develop YMCA capability, and demonstrate that capability when implemented in a GRAM-S/M form factor and a GB-GRAM-M SSI form factor.  The contractor is expected to fulfill the following MUE Receiver Card Development Program objectives:
  

1.	Design, develop, test, and document a YMCA compliant GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI, ensuring the receiver cards meet the requirements specified by the MUE TRD and other applicable requirements documents.   

2.	Implement a design for the receiver cards that optimizes performance, security, and safety, while minimizing the recurring costs of future YMCA receiver production.

3.	Deliver a Government approved consolidated MUE Receiver Card Test Plan and Procedures for the functional, software, security, integration, and operational testing of both receiver cards.

4.	Verify both receiver cards meet performance, environmental, security, and safety requirements, in accordance with Government-approved contractor MUE Receiver Card Test Plan, the MUE Security Certification Plan and the MUE TRD.

5.	Generate detailed specifications for each receiver card and its interfaces.
6.	Deliver complete documentation, data, and software for specifying the design, implementation, and production of the developed YMCA receiver cards including detailed information on the core components developed or selected for implementing the cards.

7.	Support Government testing of the GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI cards, in accordance with the Government test and evaluation strategy.

8.	Recommend modifications and enhancements to the GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI card requirements to ensure the implementation of common core receiver card components with the widest application.

9.	Recommend modifications to the GRAM Protection Profile and to the MUE Security Certification Plan, as well as other related specifications, ICDs, and ISs.

10.	Support demonstration of the GRAM-S/M receiver cards into a LRU.

Potential offerors must have the ability to process, maintain, and store collateral secret and special access required information.  

The Government has identified a proposed work breakdown structure (WBS) that will provide insight into each receiver card being developed. 

Contractual Issues: The MUE Receiver Card Development contract effort is anticipated to be a cost-plus award fee type contract with a period of performance of 48 months. 
It also includes special studies and support for the receiver demonstration on a cost-plus fixed fee basis.

The Government expects to issue a final Request for Proposal for the MUE program on or about October 2005.   A notice will be issued prior to its issuance.  This information can be obtained through the GPS Bidder’s Library.  Parties interested in accessing this information should apply at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary where they must provide adequate justification for access, all contact information, and a Government point of contact (Capt Daniel Vore, SMC/GPUM, 310-363-5885).  For contractual questions, please contact Lt David Kindt at (310) 363-0194 or Lt Keith Boyea at (310) 363-6193.

This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request.  

RFP ACCESS: As the RFP documents are updated to reflect the changes in program direction they will be placed in draft on the GPS Bidder’s Library.  Parties interested in accessing this information should apply at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary where they must provide adequate justification for access, all contact information, and a Government point of contact (Capt Daniel Vore, SMC/GPUM, 310-363-5885).  Additionally, the Government posted industry responses from the previous draft RFP on the bidder’s library.  The document is titled Industry Comments.

PROGRAMMATICS: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is the SMC Director of Staff.  The director of staff can be reached at 310-363-3571.

DECLARATION: This publication is for information only and does not constitute a final Request for Proposal (RFP), Government sponsorship of contractor charges against any Government contract for proposal efforts, or a government promise to pay for any information received in response to this announcement.

Summary of Changes Resultant to Industry Comments:

1.	The issue of recurring cost associated with the designs developed under this solicitation was not addressed in previous announcements.  The Government has determined it has an overriding interest in ensuring that the designs developed under this proposed solicitation have taken into consideration future recurring costs inherent within the receiver card designs.  Accordingly, to ensure best value to the Government, recurring costs associated with the proposed designs will be a significant consideration in the Governments’ determination of best value of proposals submitted.  It will also remain a significant area of emphasis in the execution of the MUE program effort and will be influential in award fee decisions.

2.	The long range objective is to produce receiver cards that meet the requirements at the lowest overall recurring cost.  Production (low rate initial production or production) will not be part of this instant effort. 

3.	As of this date the Trusted Foundry Policy Directive and its implementation has not be issued.  Therefore, the Government does not anticipate a requirement that mandates its use. The Government only anticipates requesting respondents how the “Trusted” aspects have been considered.

4.	The effort to develop both types of chips is reflected in only one line item.

5.	The Government intends to award at least two contracts.

NOTE: The following provisions with a "Fill-in" MUST BE COMPLETELY FILLED OUT and submitted with the offer: 52.219-1 [FILL-IN]; 52.222-22 [FILL-IN]; 52.222-25 [FILL-IN]. CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a! ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!  for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revi! sed performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment! , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. To be eligible for award you must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.  Lack of registration in the CCR shall make an offeror INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD. Past performance will be evaluated using the Navy's RED/YELLOW/GREEN program as follows: (A) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System, Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) program. RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of ! proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source contract to Motion Control Systems, Inc. of New River, VA for fabrication and delivery of one (1) Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV) control motor. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. All of the motor and controller assemblies used on the SDV Mk 8 Mod 1 program to date have been purchased from Motion Control Systems.  These motors and controllers contain proprietary engineering technology that no other manufacturer could duplicate without extensive effort. Significant portions of the motor and controller assembly are identified by Source Control Drawings that identify Motion Control as the single source, which preclude substitution of items without comprehensive qualification testing. As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Motion Control Systems, Inc. is the only source with sufficient in-depth knowledge of the control motor that!  could fabricate the control motors and deliver on schedule without substantial duplication of cost to the Government. Given these facts, Motion Control Systems, Inc. is uniquely qualified to build and deliver the required motors. NAICS 335312 applies. FSC 6105. Small Business Size Standard is 500. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.

The object of the CETS and CMS is to evaluate the technical skills and abilities of military personnel responsible or operation and maintenance of the identified equipment, the level of self-sufficiency.  The requirement is for CETS and CMS to provide various fleet and shore activities with an estimated 2,988 man months of effort for the purpose of informing, instructing and training Department of Defense personnel in the installation, operation and maintenance of the F/A-18 and AV-8B Aircraft.

McDonnell Douglas designed, developed and manufactured the identified equipment and is the only source available with requisite technical data and specific technical knowledge.  The period of performance will be 1 October 2003 through 30 September 2004, with two twelve-month option periods. Any resultant contract will contain the clause at FAR 42.217-8, Option to Extend Services.   Responsible sources having the engineering and technical field service and maintenance capabilities described above may submit and offer which will be considered to: Attn: Lenette Santana, T&E Logistic Contracts Department, Code 2543000E, NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, 575 I Avenue, Suite 1, Point Mugu, CA  93042 or via email to lenette.Santana@navy.mil.

In compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Accessibility Standard 1194.21 applies to this procurement. Accessibility Standards can be found at www.access-board.gov/news/508-final.htm.  NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from VSee Lab LLC only only for programming support to modify VSee, a proprietary software video teleconferencing product for laptops, to interface with the Command, Control, Communications and Information (C3I) Message Bus architecture.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.    Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.	 Market research failed to locate any other mention of the VSee product outside of the company that produces and sells it.  Since modification of this proprietary product can only be done by the owners of the product, there is no other vendor available to provide the service.   2.	 To interface software products to the C3I message bus, application level software libraries will have to be developed or modified for interoperable communications.  The C3I message bus libraries, developed by the Government, are available.  Software libraries for VSee are proprietary and are intellectual property of VSee Lab.  This vendor is the only qualified source for this service as they are the developer of the product used. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 12, 2005.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with Performance Associates, Inc., Ojai, CA 93024, to acquire mainframe tools and services to meet the SSA’s IT Operational Assurance (ITOA) recovery testing needs in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.106-1(b)(1) as the circumstances of the action deem only one source available.  The PAI/O Driver for z/OS from Performance Associates is both a technology independent and vendor independent set of tools and services for evaluating the performance characteristics of storage subsystems.  The PAI/O Driver is an extensive set of software tools, an acquisition methodology, subsystems profiles, profiling software, and a number other services used to evaluate storage subsystems.  The product comprises four distinct parts (1) A DASD acquisition methodology; (2) A reporting service based on independent testing of DASD subsystems; (3) Profiling software to characterize your storage requirements; and (4) Software, which allows users to measure and verify DASD and tape backup subsystems performance.  Rather than being a benchmark of a particular workload, PAI/O Driver for z/OS employs a specifically designed standard engineering test series to explore the performance characteristics of any DASD or tape subsystem over a wide variety of configuration alternatives and workload types.  The software features a standard engineering test series and includes SAS® workload profiling software for the development of customer-specific performance verification tests.  SSA will employ PAI/O Driver for z/OS to help determine DASD and tape backup requirements and configurations that the SSA may employ in ITOA operations.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, under the authority cited above.  This is not a request for quote; quotes submitted in response to this notice will not be considered.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Kaiser Foundation Research Institute, 1800 Harrison Street, Oakland CA  94612 for an expansion study into the feasibility of developing a smoker’s registry in managed care health systems.  Understanding the causes of tobacco use, addiction, and tobacco-related cancers and applying this knowledge to their prevention and treatment is one of the NCI’s challenges.  This order will expand on a current study being conducted by the NCI’s Cancer Research Network (CRN) and led by Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research (Kaiser Permanente Northwest). This study, entitled “HMO’s  investigating Tobacco, Phase II (HIT 2)”, includes development of a method for extracting tobacco cessation treatment information from electronic medical records in four medium sized HMOs. This order will examine several methodological and logistical issues related to designing and implementing a longitudinal study of the natural history of quitting tobacco use.  Kaiser Foundation Research Institute will modify the data collection procedures for HIT 2 to provide a tobacco registry for all HMO members at each site.  They shall develop a method for identifying tobacco users using existing electronic medical records in four health plans with an overall enrollment of about two million members.  Kaiser Foundation Research Institute is the only vendor known to the DCCPS that can perform this expansion study.  There is no other contractor that has the access to this population or the information from the on-going HIT-2 study.   This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.     All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 19, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

As part of the evaluation p rocess, all offerors must provide proof of their bonding capacity.  Bonding Limits are as follows:  Single Task Order $10 M and aggregate $30 M.

Questions and Answers for Solicitation GS11P05YMC0123


A.    Potomac Annex Take - Off

      Q1. How far to the east of the Potomac Annex take-off is the new main steam line anchor to be installed?

	A1. To clarify the specifications, the new steam line anchor is to be relocated 6 feet east of the existing anchor.

      Q2. No design specifications were provided for this anchor indicating any consideration of pipe line reactions.

	A2. No design is necessary as the anchor is to be replaced in kind (ie: the same or similar design as the existing anchor).

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled "CONTINUATION OF PROJECT AND CENTER PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS SUPPORT SERVICES" / PR4200118779 which was posted on September 6, 2005.  You are notified that the following changes are made:  The basis for conducting this procurement as a sole source requirement is due to the fact that the incumbent, BAE Systems, has been providing this support under the current contract since February 2003 and that, since the requirement is currently at a critical point in performance, the decision was made to allow this bridge to the recently awarded contract MSFC for Engineering Sciences and Technical Services (ESTS) Support.  In so doing, a smooth transition can be made from the current contract to ESTS. The due date for responses IS NOT extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is   http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=62    Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice to identify sources that can provide an adaptive optics (AO) subsystem for use in free space optical communications.  The Optics Division (AFRL/DES) has engaged in research and development to achieve a higher technical maturity level for curvature based wavefront sensing adaptive optic (AO) systems. The objectives of this effort are to develop, fabricate, and demonstrate an adaptive optics (AO) subsystem for use in free space optical communications. This AO subsystem would provide a significant improvement in laser communications link availability between ground-to-ground terminals; ground-to-and from-airborne mobile terminals; and eventually between airborne mobile terminals. Previous efforts had the specific goal of increasing system bandwidths to greater than 6Khz with a technical path for increasing system bandwidths to 10Khz. The goal of this current effort will be to produce a system capable of achieving system bandwidths exceeding 10Khz.  Respondents must have previously demonstrated Adaptive Optics system performance at closed loop bandwidths exceeding 2.5khz, and have demonstrated such adaptive optics systems in integrated bi-directional FSO links.

Respondents are required to provide a statement of capability containing pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas: 1. Experience: An outline of projects previously performed relevant to the subject areas. 2. Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientific, engineering and program management personnel who might be assigned to work in the areas of subject effort. 3. Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration. Responses are limited to 15 pages including program plan, resumes, attachments, diagrams, etc. Any responses not addressing all requirements will be rejected. Submit responses to Linda Buix, AFRL/PKDL, 2251 Maxwell Ave. SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5773 no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of this announcement by 3:00 p.m., Mountain Daylight Time (MDT).

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Chemical and Biological (CB) Defense Science and Technology (S&T) Program is seeking interested sources capable of innovative or novel capabilities in multiple disciplines including materials science, computer science, chemistry, biology, medical research and systems engineering.  To satisfy these requirements, for the first time in its history, DTRA anticipates the use of Other Transactions to reach sources that do not traditionally respond to Government solicitations.  It is also anticipated that traditional sources and traditional contracts, grants and cooperative agreements may be used. DTRA plans to release a draft Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) on or about October 15, 2005 and a final BAA in late February 2006.
Research activities within the CB Defense S&T Program fall into the following categories:

•	Medical science and technology programs look at pretreatments (i.e., vaccines) diagnostics, therapeutics to counter both existing and emerging threats;
. 
•	Physical Science and Applied Technology programs focusing on Collection, Detection, Protection, Decontamination, Modeling & Simulation, and Support Science & Technology; and 
.
•	Technology Transition Programs focus on Transition Planning, War-fighter Enhancement, Test and Evaluation, and Homeland Defense.

DTRA is seeking those organizations with the capability to identify, seek and establish relationships with non-traditional and traditional entities capable of providing required solutions or technologies to support the CB Defense and S&T Programs over the next five years.  Flexible organizations and organizational structures are a must, to adapt to the changing CB S&T environment.  DTRA will consider all possible relationships proposed by offerors that provide a flexible, commercially compatible agreement that facilitates basic and applied research, and prototype development, demonstration, and evaluation for commercial applications and technologies.  Potential sources having the capability necessary to assist the CB Defense S&T Program in identifying and pursuing the above services are invited to provide information demonstrating their capabilities.  
Information submitted should demonstrate the firm’s capability to reach the largest pool of traditional and/or non-traditional defense contractors in the areas identified above, and clearly identify the methods used to obtain sources, technologies, products and services related to CB Defense S&T.  Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status, if applicable, teaming partners and/or major subcontractors or prime.  It is requested that capability statements be in PDF Format and be limited to five (5) pages in length.  This is a request for information for planning purposes.

DTRA plans to hold an initial Industry Day on or about December 1, 2005 for interested parties.

Information regarding where and when to submit capability statements will be posted to this website:  lhttps://cbd.cnttr.dtra.mil in the near future.  Stay tuned to this web site for further information.

Questions may be directed to Ms. Mary Poole at (703) 325-7658 or via e-mail at mary.poole@dtra.mil.  Anonymous questions may be submitted via the link below.  All questions and responses will be posted to this web site.

<DESC>By this notice, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS or the Service) is surveying the market for firms who are capable of delivering individual and group leadership coaching and training on coaching concepts for participants in the Service’s Executive Readiness (XR) program.  We envision that during the base year the service provider will conduct twelve individual coaching sessions over a six-month period to each of thirty–six program participants.  This individual coaching will include (1) utilizing the IRS 360 degree assessment instrument to assess leadership competencies for each participant, assist them in identifying areas for growth and development, and periodically assess with them the progress of the coaching; (2) defining a development plan for each participant describing the goals of their coaching contract and determining how the goals will be measured in specific outcomes; (3) in the individual coaching sessions, developing, designing and delivering self-observations, practices and other activities and materials to assist the participants in their growth as managers, and (4) providing  each participant with a summary evaluation that includes a narrative summary of his/her growth and recommendations for future development.  The service provider will provide a coaching program overview at the Executive Readiness Orientation in Washington, DC during January of 2006.  The service provider shall provide six group coaching sessions over a six month period to six groups of program participants.  The firm shall provide a four-hour training session for all participants on coaching concepts, including using reflection as a means of self-development, developing self-observations, establishing coaching practices, utilizing speech acts (requests, promises, offers, etc.), dealing with moods and emotions, and building executive presence.  The service provider shall also solicit and summarize feedback on the coaching program from participants and shall solicit and summarize feedback on the observed growth of the participants during the program from their supervisors.  Four option years of service will be included, with similar requirements.  In order to be considered well qualified, firms shall provide coaches who have a minimum of 240 hours of coaching experience working predominantly with managers and executives in Government agencies (preferred) or private industry.  Coaches with Master Coach Certifications or equivalent professional designations will be considered most favorably.  Qualified firms interested in competing for this requirement should return a response to this notice including a summary of company qualifications and the experience and qualifications of available coaches (summary only – no resumes or lengthy descriptions are sought at this time), as well as a ballpark estimate of annual costs for the tasks described above.

<SUBJECT>D -- NATO Invitation to Participate in an Exhibition on the Use of Commercial Wireless Technology by the Military
<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Board (NC3B) is organizing an exhibition on the use of commercial wireless technology by the military. The exhibition will be held at NATO Headquarters, Brussels, Belgium, on 29-30 November 2005.

The NC3B plans to invite companies to exhibit their specific technologies, applications, or equipment with respect to wireless technologies that can be used in a military environment. As the subject of wireless technologies is extremely broad, the exhibition will be focused an commercial wireless technologies in Local Area Networks. Examples are IEEE 802 standards and related/supporting technologies both Hardware and Software. Of specific interest are the Security and Architectural aspects of these technologies.

The exhibition will give the representatives of a select group of industry and research establishments the opportunity to speak with the senior C3 officers of NATO and Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council nations. Furthermore, as it will be held at NATO Headquarters, the exhibit will draw the attention of the senior military and diplomatic officials located in Brussels.

Due to space limitations at NATO Headquarters, the NC3B must be highly selective in determining participants in the exhibition. It will strive for a mix of technologies to be shown - giving priority to those that are highly interactive in nature. It will be looking for both large and small companies to be represented, from as many of nations as possible. 

ELIGIBILITY

Requests for participation sent directly to NATO cannot be considered. If your firm would like to participate in this exhibition, you must first complete a Questionnaire that will be provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce. To receive a copy of the NC3B Questionnaire, send an email to Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov or dnewsom@bis.doc.gov. A completed Questionnaire must be submitted to the NATO Exhibition Team no later than October 7, 2005. Instructions for submission will be included with the Questionnaire.

R – CONSULTING SERVICES
POC: Angela Green, Contract Specialist, 202-283-1283. 

The following is a Request for Comment (RFC). This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal. The President’s Management Agenda addresses initiatives proposed by the President that are designed to improve government performance. The purpose of the RFC is to afford industry an opportunity to comment on any perceived issues with regard to the management agenda and to allow the Government to receive the benefit of industry comments. The Government’s purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas, and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of the initiative. The Government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative. Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package. Comments are solicited regarding the draft statement of work posted on the IRS website. 
Comments, whether supportive or critical, are earnestly solicited regarding every aspect of the proposed initiative. Replies are not mandatory. Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Requests for Proposals. The use of comments received from industry to complete final statements of work and resulting solicitation documents will be at the discretion of the IRS. Any subsequent solicitations will be synopsized prior to its release. Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. The Government will not critique a potential offeror’s comments and the RFC should not be used by offerors to market their products/services. The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the RFC. Proprietary information is not being solicited. Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such. Responses to this synopsis must be submitted in writing to the Contract Specialist via email at Angela.M.Green@irs.gov no later than September 19, 2005.

<DESC>Since the tsunami disaster, the Mission’s program has seen an increased need to respond to public inquiries, substantially increasing the workload related to information dissemination.  The radically increased scope and visibility of the Mission’s efforts require proactive and thorough dissemination of information on Mission activities.  The Development Outreach and Communications Officer (DOC) therefore seeks to secure the services of a firm well experienced in preparation and production of outreach materials to implement this strategy.
III.	Statement of Work
A.	Objectives
The purpose of this contract is to provide assistance to the USAID/Sri Lanka Mission to develop and produce media and outreach materials.  These include, but are not limited to, the following initiatives:
•	Design and production of informational brochures
Source material including text and photographs will come from within the Mission.  Required service includes design and production of brochures including but not necessarily limited to a Mission overview; each of the Mission’s four Strategic Objectives, and Tsunami Relief and Reconstruction.  These will come in the form of folding three-ply documents, plus a complete package of replacable and updatable cards within a folder produced with artwork illustrating the Mission’s programs.
•	50th Anniversary Campaign.  
USAID celebrates its 50th Anniversary of activity in Sri Lanka in April of 2006.  Accordingly, a celebratory campaign must be designed and executed in the months leading up to a main event to be held on or about April of next year.  This might include production and distribution of posters, media tours to Missoin projects, speaking engagements by key mission staff.   The campaign will also include production and distribution of caps, t-shirts, key chains, pens, stickers and other giveaway items readily produced in Sri Lanka. 
•	Design, production and distribution of branding products.  USAID seeks to promote the newly-created brand before the public.  Separate from the 50th anniversary items, the Mission wants to undertake a general awareness promotional campaign via distribution of the products mentioned in the previous paragraph, and is eager to entertain suggestions about other branding products especially relevant to the Sri Lankan public.
•	Organization of media site visits.  USAID is eager to cultivate relationships with the local print and televised media.  To that end, anticipated 12 media site visits for six journalists each.  In consultation with USAID, the contractor will select sites, assemble the journalists, organize scheduling, lodging, transport and other logisitics for the tours.
•	Staff speakers.  Senior international and Sri Lankan staff represent a wealth of information about development activities within the Mission’s four strategic objectives.  As such, they are valuable tools to publicize the Mission’s work to Sri Lankan audiences, both at the academic and community level.  The contractor will arrange such events as appropriate.
This list is illustrative only and the actual products will be determined over the course of the contract period by the DOC.  The DOC will provide guidance and textual research materials to the contractor and will obtain approvals and modifications from Mission staff.  
Media materials will be used to publicize the following events and programs:
•	Visits by VIP officials and other visitors.  The mission receives hundreds of visitors each year and needs to have a stock of briefing materials on hand
•	Program brochures.  These will consist of replaceable cards or other materials in a folder with information about individual program elelments, budget information, photographs, etc.  that can be maintaned by the DOC upon completion of the contract. 
B.	Deliverables
Working with the DOC, the Contractor will prepare appropriate representations—mockups, draft materials, storyboards, as appropriate—of the products described above, for review by mission staff.  Upon approval of each item, the Contractor will ensure production, printing, manufacture and distribution as appropriate.
C. Relationships and Responsibilities
The contractor will report directly to the DOC Officer or his/her designee.  In addition, the contractor will be required to coordinate closely with all USAID/SriLanka program managers, the US government agencies in Srilanka and Partners as needed to secure information about USAID programs and strategies.
III. Qualifications

The contractor/firm will have:
•	A proven track record in media and publicity efforts in Sri Lanka;
•	Corporate Capacity to develop creative materials and advise on media strategies and demonstrated past experience of similar work undertaken;
•	Experience in working in high-profile and very fluid environments and with disaster situations desirable;
•	At least 5 years of Experience with television, radio and other print media; and 
•	Demonstrated experience interacting with USG officials and public as well as the Sri Lankan government and public at various levels.
IV.  Performance Period and Estimated Level of Effort
	The expected duration of the contract/work is 12 months, from o/a October 2005 through 2006.

<DESC>1.  The 37th Contracting Squadron, Lackland AFB TX, has a requirement to provide chapel music services in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ) number FA3047-06-TC050.  The performance period is 01 October 2005 through 30 September 2006, with 4 one-year option periods.  This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.  Award is contingent upon availability of funds.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05 and DFARS Change Notice 20050901.  The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 711130; size standard $6,000,000.00.

2.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.  Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1 and the attached CLIN structure.  Oral quotes will not be accepted.  Your quote should include your Cage Code, DUNS, and Tax Identification numbers.  To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ, contractors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, no exceptions.  To register, please visit http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.  Contractors must complete the Representations and Certifications in the ORCA database at http://www.bpn.gov/orca.   

3.  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Addendum:  Basis for Award:  This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures.  For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.  Offers shall propose on all items.  Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.  An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.  Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 

4.  The evaluation process will proceed as follows:  (a) Technical Acceptance:  By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, and requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract, and will be determined technically acceptable.  Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:  Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price, including option prices.  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness and realism subject to the processes described in paragraph 8.  Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.  Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished; (c) Past Performance:  Using questionnaires, the contracting officer will seek relevant and recent performance information on all technically acceptable offers based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Recency:  To be considered recent, a contract shall have been performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this posting.  Relevancy:  Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude.  Magnitude consists of the contractor's ability to provide a variety of music for multi-faith groups.  The following varying degrees of relevancy apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort this solicitation requires.  Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Somewhat Relevant:  Past/present performance effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Not Relevant:  Past/present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation required.  Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 6 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers to the point of contact identified in paragraph 11 of this posting not later than 14 Sep 05.   The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager.

5.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  All technically acceptable quotes will receive a performance confidence assessment rating of high, significant, satisfactory, unknown, little, or no confidence as defined in paragraph 6 of this solicitation.  The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.  The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  A trade-off process is then conducted.  The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.  A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror is received.  In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.  

6.  High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable. Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

7.  Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.  Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive a neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  However, a rating other than neutral may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts, or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts.  When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.  The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.  The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond. 

8.  If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, and is judged to have an overall high performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.  If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated high confidence in the performance assessment, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated high confidence overall for past performance.  An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.  If no proposals are rated high confidence in the performance assessments, an integrated analysis will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.

9.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of “very good” or lower.  (2) If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.  The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest price offeror if that lowest priced offeror.  The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.   

10.  The following clauses and provisions are applicable to this solicitation:  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, FAR 52.219-1 Alt 1, Small Business Program Representations, FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, Addendum: Para (c) Changes is tailored as follows:  The contracting officer may modify the contract unilaterally under the following circumstances:  (a) to make administrative changes that do not affect the price or substantive terms; (b) to issue change orders or directions; or (c) to make changes authorized by clauses other than a changes clause, including but not limited to the Property clause, or Suspension of Work Clause.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>Opportunity for Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) For Development of a Spin Test Facility (Dynamometer)

Summary:  The Department of Energy/National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) seeks a CRADA partner to collaborate in developing a Dynamometer Spin Test (Dyno) capability for testing large scale wind turbines.  The DOE’s goal is development of alternative testing capabilities from those at the National Wind Technology Center (NWTC), as the NWTC facilities are greatly backlogged.

It is intended that the facility developed under this CRADA will be available for use by wind industry and other potential users at a reasonable cost and profit for the private-sector Dyno operator.  DOE/NREL intends to make available for this facility a large capacity gearbox (speed increaser) and wound rotor generator.  This unit will be provided to the Dyno operator for the duration of this CRADA.  The gearbox is rated at roughly 1900 kNm at 17.3 rpm on the low speed shaft.  It has a maximum torque rating of 2300 kNm.  It has double helical epicyclic planetary gears with a total ratio of 102.6:1.  It was manufactured by ASEA STAL.  It weighs approximately 40,000 lbs.  The Generator/Motor is a 4160 VAC wound rotor induction machine rated at 3.2 MWs.  This unit has rotor brushes and is capable of being operated in several modes including variable speed, given the appropriate Variable Speed Drive Electronics.  The unit was manufactured by Siemens.  This unit weighs approximately 20,000 lbs.  All equipment and facilities above and beyond the gearbox and generator must be supplied by the CRADA partner.  Due to funding limitations, no NREL labor for design and set up of the Dyno facility will be available, unless reimbursed by the Dyno operator.

The gearbox and generator to be provided in this agreement are units salvaged from the NASA/DOE Mod 5 wind turbine test in Kahuku Point, Hawaii.  These units should be expected to require some modifications and extensive servicing, as they have not been operational for a period of close to 10 years.  Before entering into a CRADA agreement the selected partner will be allowed to tear down and inspect the units to determine if they are adequate for their intended purpose.  If it is determined that the units are not acceptable, then negotiations may be cancelled.  This tear down and inspection should take place at the offeror’s facilities.  Transportation, tear down and inspection shall be at the offeror’s expense.  If the units are rejected then the offeror is required to reassemble the units and return them to the NWTC in a reasonable time frame.

In return for the loan of the gearbox and generator, the Dyno Operator shall allow DOE/NREL access to the Dyno facility for testing purposes during periods when the Dyno is not otherwise occupied with industry tests.  DOE/NREL tests will incur no facility fees for use of the Dyno during these tests, but will be responsible for any subsequent costs associated with operation, including set-up labor, instrumentation costs, and electrical power consumed during testing.  Such subsequent costs shall be handled in a separate subcontract between NREL and the Dyno operator.

Dates:  Confidential CRADA proposal summaries, preferably three pages or less, must be submitted to Mr. Neil Wikstrom by 4:00 PM, Mountain Time, October 7, 2005, to take full advantage of this opportunity to leverage DOE resources.  CRADA proposal summaries submitted thereafter may be considered if a suitable CRADA Collaborator is not selected from among the timely responses.  Final negotiations of CRADA agreements and terms and conditions will be completed after initial discussions have concluded.

Supplementary Information:  Selection of an offering of collaboration will be solely at the discretion of laboratory management, based on interest in the testing, and laboratory assessment of the likelihood that the proposed collaboration will result in a commercial testing facility appropriate for utility-scale wind turbines.  NREL is owned by the U.S. DOE and equipment loan and expenditure of all NREL funds are subject to the approval of the DOE. 

A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable collaborations between Government laboratories and industry partners.  It is not a grant, and is not a contract for procurement of goods/services.  The CRADA may be funded by the industrial partner for specific work to be performed by NREL, and will not result in a transfer of funds from the laboratory to the industry partner. The expected duration of the proposed CRADA may be up to ten years.

CRADA Evaluation Criteria:  The following criteria shall be used by NREL in evaluating all submissions.
1.  The level to which the proposed partnership contributes to DOE technical goals and objectives as they relate to Utility Wind Turbine Drive Train Testing (20%).
2.  The level of commitment resources and funds proposed by the partner toward developing the Dynamometer facility (30%).
3.  The background and technical expertise of the partner in the area of gear design, fabrication, and testing (30%).
4.  Access to the facility by other wind industry members to be offered by the partner (20%).

Addresses:  Proposal submissions should be sent to:

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML #5030. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05B dated 8/26/05. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339111 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), has been charged with performing basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing 16(sixteen) genomes will assist towards achieving those goals. The NIAID/RML has a need to construct a custom chip from the manufacturer that shall contain a diverse array of bacterial pathogens. This chip shall be unique and specific to NIAID/RML.  No other chip of its kind shall exist. The contractor shall provide to NIAID/RML services  to produce a custom bacterial pathogen gene chip. This is a 6 to 8(six-eight) week, one time work effort, where the final product shall be a custom gene chip containing oligo pairs at high density, specific to 16(sixteen) bacterial pathogen genomes.  These chips shall be compatible with the Affymetrix fluidics and hybridization station and scanner. The contractor shall keep all NIAID/RML derived data secure and shall not release or maintain any of the data beyond this contract effort. If Internet connectivity is needed in order to perform the work, or transfer deliverables, contractor computers shall be secure and in compliance with NIAID/RML IT security procedures and policies.  The NIAID/RML will provide support access to Technical support from Affymetrix regarding the NIAID/RML custom chip if needed.  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES:  Step 1: The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix. The chip shall be high density,  at 106 per cm2 or greater (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip® shall be made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip® probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1(one) mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip® probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array shall be based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and shall be able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array shall be housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. We will process the chips on the Affymetrix system in Frederick, MD (NIAID) which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray® Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML #5031. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05B dated 8/26/05. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325414 and the small business size is 500. SCHEDULE: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), has a requirement to perform basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. The sequencing of pathogen genomes is paramount to those diagnostic and vaccine based discoveries. The NIAID, RML has a need for construction of an Affymetrix microarray chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing the open reading frames of 16(sixteen) bacterial pathogen genomes, condensed into composite, single and intergenic coverage genomes to contribute towards achieving those goals. The contractor shall provide the following: 1) Services to construct and provide sequence and annotation files for bacterial genomes that shall conform to specifications defined by Affymetrix in the GeneChip® CustomExpress™ Array Design Guide and approved in advance by the Affymetrix Chip Design Team.  2) This shall be a 10(ten) week, one time work effort, where the final product shall be the production of flat files, 2(two) per composite, single and intergenic genome. 3) The files shall be compatible with Affymetrix design criteria for custom chip synthesis.  4)  The contractor shall use URLs and RML data, some of which is incorporated into the RML ERGO server, to construct final files for each of the genomes discussed below.  These final files shall be Fasta files of ORFs and annotation files for those ORFs in tab delimited format with column headers.  5) 2(two) files total, per composite, single and intergenic genome effort shall be constructed, one in fasta format and the other in annotation format.  Unique identifiers for all orfs present in the RML ERGO server shall be incorporated into the annotation files. The final Fasta and annotation files shall match the format Affymetrix requests. The final Fasta and annotation files shall meet project officer specifications. 6) During the production of the files the contractor shall communicate with Affymetrix and the project officer in order to confirm that compliance with Affymetrix design requirements in the form of these files is occurring. (7   A final conference call shall occur with the RML project officer, Affymetrix, and the contractor to confirm that all of Affymetrix file requirements have been met at the end of the contract.  8) The following genomes, labeled by grouping, shall be included in this effort: A. Single Genomes: 1) Acetobacter; 2) Norcardia; 3. Staphylococcus aureus MW2; 4) Staphylococcus haemolyticus JCSC1435. B. Multi-Genome Composites: 1) Staphylococcus epidermidis, strain RP62A and strain ATCC12228; 2) Coxiella burnetti, strain TIGR, strain Graves, strain Kearns; 3) Chlamydia trachomatis, strain HAR, strain D, strain L2, strain MoPn; 4) Chlamydiophila caviae GPIC, and Chlamydiophila pneumoniae AR39;  C. Intergenic Region Genomes: 1) Borrelia burgdorferi. The contractor shall provide all personnel for the work effort. The contractor shall keep all RML derived data secure and shall not release or maintain any of the data beyond this contract effort. If Internet connectivity is needed in order to perform the work, or transfer deliverables, contractor computers will be secure and in compliance with RML IT security procedures and policies.  The NIAID/RML will provide genomic data in the form of flat files and up-to-date assembly files in ace format with all supporting chromatogram files if needed.  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES: All genomes shall undergo intra and inter comparative analysis in order to identify regions of duplication and uniqueness.  For composite genome construction, 1(one) genome shall be designated as the backbone genome and shall be represented in the orf and annotation flat files in it’s near entirety (absent homologous repetitive sequences at a 97% DNA identity or higher).  Subsequent genomes that are within the same genus, but that shall make up the composite aspects of the genome shall only be represented at the level of unique sequences not present in the backbone genome (at 96% DNA identity or less).  Annotation must reflect this origin of sequence and the connection to the backbone genome.  Intergenic genomes shall involve 2(two) aspects of the genome; 1) Intergenic/non-coding regions and 2) Opposite strand coding regions.  The reason for the latter being that the chip shall be used to analyze signal RNAs, coded for in intergenic regions or opposite strands of coding regions.  Intergenic regions and opposite strand coding regions shall contain appropriate annotation for each, to be discussed and decided upon by the contractor and project officer.  Affymetrix shall be the sole source for probe pair design, synthesis and manufacturing of the chip.  Sequences shall be submitted to Affymetrix by the contractor following review and approval by the NIAID/RML project Officer. Step 1:  Receipt of all genomic materials.  Duration: From date of receipt of materials, total, 10(ten) days. Deliverables: The contractor shall provide to NIAID/RML confirmation that for each genome  category effort, the contractor has all of the necessary materials to proceed effectively.  A brief report shall also be provided outlining any areas of potential difficulty.  The contractor may begin work on flat file construction, when all of the genomic data for that effort has been received or has been made available. Step 2: Sequence scanning and analysis of all genomes. Duration: 1-2(one-two)  months total from end of receipt of materials (Step 1) for all composite, single and intergenic genomes to delivery of flat files to Affymetrix.  Deliverables: 2(two) flat files for each composite, single and intergenic genome effort, consisting of a sequence flat file and an annotation file shall be delivered by email, ftp or on CD to the project officer for review and forwarded to Affymetrix.  Flat files delivered to Affymetrix for each genome effort shall be 100% compatible with Affymetrix design criteria as defined by Affymetrix. Composite, single and intergenic genome flat file sets, including, but not limited to fasta orf files and annotation files may be delivered individually per group and invoiced as such, following acceptable review by the project officer. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE: Inspection Criteria: All work for all composite genomes will be inspected and approved by the NIAID/RML project officer or his designee via the reports and flat files submitted. Acceptance Criteria: will be based upon decisions made by the NIAID/RML project officer. FOB Point shall be Destination, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

<DESC>The following questions (Q), and answers (A) are provided for the subject Broad Agency Announcement.  Due date is unchanged.
Q1.  A line-thrower type device needs to be developed to deploy the entanglement Cord (or net) in front of the target boat.  The line throwing device is to be shoulder fired and should be compatible with existing weapons (12 gauge, 20 mm launchers.  
A1.  Per the BAA, compatability with existing weapons is desirable but is not required.

Q2.  A more effective entanglement systems needs to be developed.  The new system can either by RGES like or net like  or something else as long as it entangles the propeller.
A2.  Per the BAA, we are most interested in an effective entanglement system, meaning one that actually entangles one or more propellers on an outboard powered planning craft at least fifteen feet in length.  

Q3.  Is there a specific target size boat that is needed to be stopped?  Does the device have to stop the forty foot 675 hp craft always or is that an extreme case which may require multiple entanglement devices?  
A3.  The requirements section of the BAA states the target size/speed of the boat.  The reference to forty feet 675 hp craft is in the Background section of the BAA.  Our desire is to ultimately be able to stop that size vessel.

Q4.  Are laboratory studies acceptable for evaluating prop entanglement?
A4.  No.  Per the BAA, prop entanglement shall be proven (demonstrated) during entanglement demonstrations witnessed by the Government.

Q5.  Is the $100K limit on the Phase 1 effort or will proposals for more be accepted?
A5.  The BAA states that total funding for tthis BAA is approximately $400,000. Individual awards will not exceed $100,000.

Q6.  Is the $400,000 expected to cover Phase II effort as well or is that a separate solicitation?
A6.  The scope of this BAA covers Phase I efforts.

A. GENERAL
·	Birth Census - Please confirm that the annual birth census is between 3,000 – 3,600?  This will assist us to determine the number of transponders required. 
Answer: 3000 to 3600 births per year.
·	Existing System - We understand that there are two systems currently in place.  Who is the manufacturer, model name, date installed?  In this case it may be possible to capitalize on the existing infrastructure and reduce the cost to the facility.
Answer: Existing system is Halo and Code alert. Replace existing systems with one system for the entire protected area. Amendment 001 on FBO answered remainder.
·	Existing System Removal - Is the winning bidder required to remove the existing infant security system as part of their bid.  If so to what extent do you want the system removed (all wiring in the ceiling, all controllers, receivers, keypads on walls and existing computers if applicable), also any holes or damage to walls that is necessary when the removal occurs – is that to be patched and fixed by the facility itself or is the vendor required to do this.
Answer: Vendor will remove all existing hardware that cannot be reused. Vendor shall complete all repairs to leave the facility looking professional.
·	Target Operational Date - What is the target date for the system to operational by?
Answer: No later that January 2006
·	Infection Control Requirements - Are there infectious control / dust containment requirements?
Answer: The contractors will not be touching patients. Do not usually have MRSA/TB patients on these units so should not be an issue.
·	Hazardous Materials - Are there any hazardous building materials (e.g. asbestos) requiring abatement procedures to be considered during the installation phase? Will the facility have this done or will you require the vendor to issue a quotation for it?
Answer: No asbestos is present in the walls or ceilings. No other hazardous materials known present.
·	LAN Access - Can the system exist on the facility IT LAN?
Answer: Yes it can.  As long as it standard Ethernet we should be able to support whatever you need.  

B. DESCRIPTION
·	REQUIREMENT A - When we walked to the FAU door at the facility it was discovered that there was another door right beside the door to be secured, the facilities gentlemen pointed it out as an area that you could potentially bypass the secured door with an infant and leave via this area.  Are we to include this door in our quote for protecting the FAU area? Yes

C. CENTRAL ALARM SYSTEM

·	REQUIREMENT C. states "once activated shall allow healthcare and security personnel to have sufficient time to verify the presence of an infant before it alarms and locks all doors" Current systems once they detect the presence of tag will automatically lock the door, and notify the user as an immediate security response.  Once the user is notified they then can investigate the possible threat.  Please define what you are looking to do here – is it once an alarm sounds and security and healthcare staff are notified they can additionally lock the entire unit down?  If so how would you like to do this? 
Answer: The system should give a verbal warning at sensor location if a tag if coming close to a sensor prior to alarming or locking the door. If the infant tag has crossed the plane of the sensor the door should lock and alarm simultaneously. Only the exit/entry door where the system is being breached should lock down, not all of the exit/entry doors in system.
·	REQUIREMENT D: states “The central alarm system shall be able to integrate and not interfere with the existing security system.” 
·	Please define this, is the intent to install the new ISS system while the current ISS is still functional and not turn it off until the new system is certified and accepted by the hospital – or – are you expecting us to integrate parts of the new system into the old, such as magnetic locks? What are the security system interface requirements?
 Answer: Turn off the old system, use what you can and install the new ISS.
·	REQUIREMENT B and G of the bid it is stated: “The central alarm system shall be able to track infants down to a specific location and sense that the tag is actually on the infant without skin contact.”
a)	What is the facilities requirement of resolution / location accuracy?  Some system can locate the tag somewhere in a 2,500 – 5,000 square foot area (e.g. the tag is located somewhere in a typical family house) and others can locate the tag down to 100 – 300 sq. ft. (e.g. the size of a room in the house) – please define your requirement for tracking.
Answer: Locate tag down to the size of a room in a house.
b)	The second part of the statement “ and sense the tag is actually on the infant without skin contact “ is not possible on any system currently on the market that we are aware of.  Cut band technology is based on a band that will alarm when the circuit formed by the band and tag is cut  - but if an infant loses weight and the band is slipped off or slides off, essentially the circuit remains closed, therefore no alarm sequence is activated, or way to tell if it is on the infant.  With sensing technology the tag is always in contact with the skin and cannot be removed without causing the tag to alarm.  Clarification of this requirement is requested? 
Answer: NMCSD requires a tag that does not require adhering to skin to work. Wrap around is acceptable.

D. ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM
·	REQUIREMENT A. Regarding door locking mechanism.
a)	Are we to utilize the existing magnetic locks or are you wanting the currently installed magnetic door locks update with new versions through out, and if updated are they to be delayed egress?
Answer: Updated with delayed egress. Replaced as required, see Question 7 above.
b)	Does the facility need to have any magnetic lock installation approved prior to them being installed by the fire marshal – and is that the responsibility of the facility of the vendor?
Answer: The system must comply with NFPA.  Approval of design would be by Naval Facilities Engineering Command Fire Protection Engineers.

·	REQUIREMENT A. Who is the current Elevator Service Company, and would it be possible to provide contact information and elevator manufacturer, model, date installed, code complaints?
Answer: Current elevator service company - Chugach McKinley is the current Prime Contractor for elevator maintenance.  Kone, subcontractor to Chugach McKinley, actually performs the maintenance.  Main patient elevators would be protected by the entrance/exit sensor and camera on the 3rd deck nursing tower. Do not shut the elevators down. Only alarm if tag enters the area.
·	REQUIREMENT A. For some reason during the walk thru we did not address the main patient elevators and how they are to be protected.  Can we get a definition of what the facility will require whether it be:
a)	Bank Style Control - which, if a tag enters the area in front of the elevators which are protected, the system will see it and enter into alarm instantly and will control the elevator cars (dependant on what the elevators are capable of) by either locking the elevator(s) down if they are on the floor or bypassing the floor if they are not on the floor 
b)	Individual Control – whereby a controlling device is mounted on top of each car and will detect when a tag enters the car and it will lock “only” that car down, not affecting the other cars.  Thereby, not affecting the normal flow of staff, patient and visitors, throughout the building.
Answer: Neither. Do not shut down the elevators. If a tag enters the area in front of the main patient elevators it will alarm only, no lock down of the elevators. If plausible, 3rd Floor elevator door ONLY can be made to lock. Do not inhibit elevator car from moving.
·	 REQUIREMENT A. – Elevators. During the walk thru we entered into a service area in between the 3 units which had 2 service elevators, it was stated (Captain Grau) that there is a desire to control egress here and the elevators to lock down if a tag entered this area.  The facilities person stated that would be next to impossible to do. Please define the requirement for this area – only alarm if a tag enters the area, no control of the elevators (which poses a security risk) – or - lock the elevators and alarm when a tag enters the area?
Answer: Only alarm if a tag enters the area; do not take control of the elevators.
·	REQUIREMENT B. Of the bid you state: Each portal attached to the access control system shall have audible alarms warning people that they are approaching unauthorized exits. Please define what you mean by attached to the access control system – is there a system there that we were not show or is this meaning to be how we control the egress at the secured door (e.g. keypad, card swipe).
Answer: Currently, there is no access control system in place. NMCSD requires audible alarms when tag approaches the boundary of a protected area.

E. VIDEO MONITORING/RECORDING SYSTEM
·	REQUIREMENT A - refers to “The video system shall provide workstation display of alarm location”.  
A)	Please define what workstation(s) are to display the video capture (e.g. Security, ISS Nurse Workstations, etc.)
	B)	Is there a requirement for each video system workstation to have the ability to pan/tilt/zoom the cameras?
Answer: The video capture should be in Security in the glass house (security control), not on the nursing units. Only security should have the capability to pan/tilt/zoom the cameras. The nursing staff does not need to be in the business of security.

F. INSTALLATION AND TRAINING
·	REQUIREMENT INTRODUCTION - Will the Customer be responsible for applying for permits? 
Answer: The vendor shall be responsible for acquiring all applicable permits.
·	REQUIREMENT INTRODUCTION - Will OSPOD certification be required? 
Answer: OSPOD will not inspect at present. NMCSD Facilities will conduct a thorough inspection upon completion, acceptance pending.
·	REQUIREMENT A - How many staff members will require training by discipline (e.g. nursing, security, facilities, etc.)? This will assist us to determine the number of training days required.
 Answer provided: 300 staff. Provide training over 3 days for two different shifts 4 different units.

G. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
·	REQUIREMENT A - Power - We normally require power above each door to power the controller and the receivers by the Customer. 
a)	Can the facility provide this or does the vendor need to include this in their price and if so who does the electrical contracting for the base? 
Answer: Power is provided by facilities in designated circuit breaker boxes, vendor shall run cables as needed.
b)	If using Central Power supply where can these be located?
Answer: Facilities pointed these out during site visit and located on schematic.
·	REQUIREMENT B - “The system shall fit in the area provided (during the site visit or from the schematic) for operation”.  We were shown a room that one of the existing systems was located in.
a)	Can you please define what room(s) that is designated for the location of any equipment?
Answer: Room showed during site visit outside Labor Deck.
b)	Is the hospital responsible for the power being located in those rooms?
Answer: Power is “centrally” located in circuit breaker panels and distribution centers.
c)	Can the power provided be on emergency generator in case of power failure?
Answer: NMCSD has a separate emergency power.

H. QUOTE REQUIREMENTS
·	We understand that completed copies of both provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications (ORCA)-Commercial Items, and provision at DFARS 252.212-7000 are to be submitted with the response.  
a)	Are there other forms that are required with the submission?
 Answer: Refer to SOW on FBO.
b)	Where might we obtain copies of these forms or can they be provided?

<DESC>RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED REGARDING REFERENCE ROCR-05-0054.

1. I take it that this is an on call assignment; Will there be any set hours or is it on a day to day basis? 
A: There is a schedule established, and the contractor’s will be a part of this schedule

2. Will pagers or cell phones be provided?
No. Contractors are expected to have their own cell phones.

3. Would an interim secret clearance work initially? Yes. We can work with you to process the paperwork, but an interim secret is necessary.

4. How many interpreters resumes do you intend to receive in the RFQ? Please send the most qualified and those who are available. Any resume we receive, we will assume the person is considered “key” and therefore available.

5. Is this a new requirement or is there an incumbent?
There is an incumbent.

 6. American Sign Language is the requirement that you have; will there be any need for someone who is fluent in both ASL and ESL?  
This has not been identified as an immediate need. 

7. How much will company past performance weigh in the decision of the win? 
It is one of the criteria. Personnel resumes/background and company past performance are of utmost importance to the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

<DESC>This amendment answers questions posed by vendors (who submitted them by the Wednesday, July 20, 2005 deadline listed in the combined synopsis/solicitation).  The questions and answers are below.  Due to the need to make award in a timely fashion, no more questions can be answered.  Accordingly, quotations should be made based on the original solicitation and this amendment.   
 
1)  How many interpreters will be required?    About 8 total. It depends upon the event. Generally, it is for one or two people in the office. 
 
2)  Will it be required to have one interpreter per employee for 20 hours per week?     The same interpreter is not required to be in the office for the entire time.
 
3)  Will there be set hours for the interpreter(s)?    We anticipate a 40 hours/week work week. Generally, it is 8-5 [with an hour for lunch], but with special events, that may vary.
 
4) The soliciation notifies multiple awards. Will each award be similar? Is there a description for each award?      Each award will be for the same services.

5)  Is there an agency currently providing sign language interpretering services?  If so, is it possible to know which agency provides the services?     We have several agencies providing these services right now.  Releasing such names would not affect quotes and thus do not need to be provided.  
 
6) Is there any knowledge at this time of a future location for DHS? If so, will the location be metro accessible?    No knowledge available, for either question.  

7.  Will DHS sponsor secret security clearances? Since the whole process takes more than 75 days.     DHS will turn in and follow the paperwork for clearances, but it is each company’s responsibility to be able to manage their own clearance process.

8. Does DHS intend to ask the approved vendors to compete for every task order it will issue under this BPA?    No. Generally, we define a process for using the approved vendors.

9. How many companies do you expect to be providing these services?     Minimum 3-4

10. Who is the incumbent?     See answer #5 above.

11. What is the typical duration of the interpretation jobs?       These are for continued services. We'll need people to support deaf employees of the department on a daily basis as well as special events.

12. Are there any limitations--will travel and parking expenses be paid if a project should last for less than 2 hours in any one day?     Yes, travel and parking would be reimbursed in such a case. 

13. What is your policy on paying two interpreters for the same project? (It is standard practice among interpreters to work in teams of two, to provide each other with adequate rest and to assure the quality of their work, with both being paid?).       
       This will depend upon the circumstances and needs. At times, two interpreters will definitely be needed, but at other times, one is enough.

<DESC>Request for Quotation Number SB1341-05-Q-0997 is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted. 

The due date for quotations remains unchanged.

QUESTION: (6) The system should support different configurations for different type of works such as thin-film reflectometry, powder capillary samples, etc.  The reconfiguration (such as parallel to focus beam and alignment) should be fast (i.e. within 10-15 min.);  

Is this to be interpreted as the system needs to come equipped to be able to perform data analysis on thin-film reflectometry samples, and powder capillary samples or that it needs to have this capability for future upgrades

RESPONSE:  The major use of the x-ray will be cappillery powder diffraction. Hence the system should come equipped for powder diffraction. However, the x-ray diffractometer should have the capability for future upgrades for focus beam optics and  reflectivity studies.

QUESTION:  (8) The system must come with a software package for data collection and analysis, and must include technical support for the first year.  Companies offer  many software packages for powder analysis. Including Phase ID, Profile fitting, Rietveld, refinement, Indexing.  

Are all of these software packages required, none of them, or a subset thereof?

RESPONSE:  We need the software to collect the x-ray data and control the instrument and a basic software to plot the observed data, find the peak positions and intensities, etc. We do not need rietveld refinement, phase ID softwares.  However, the vendor can put these software as additional options in the quote.

Are the physical files in good order, and/or will the contractor be required to reconstruct missing award/modification or other significant documents? A3. Most files are in good order, however reconstruction of files and transferred work from other buying activities will exist. Q4. Will  we have a single CO/KO as point of contact for signing off on closeouts, or will we be working with various COs/KOs? A4. A CO/KO is designated as a team leader. However coordination with the CO/KO of records may be required. Q5. Will contracts be consider ed closed when payment is authorized, or do the records have to be closed in DFAS? A5. Closeouts are considered complete for the 435 count when brought to a point inherently governmental remaining. If a de-obligation is required the amount is to be noted b y the closeout contractor but does not need to be cleared through DFAS to count fo r the 435 count, provided the work submitted was in accordance with the standards in the PWS. Q6. Am I to understand you correctly, that at each contract close out that time s the rate per contract (contract x rate = billing dollars amount). A6. The contractor will be paid a rate per contract closed out. ie: If the contractor performs 30 contract closeouts in a month, and the rate per contract is $2, they will bill as follows:  (# of contracts closed out) x (amt per contract closed out) 30 x $2 = $60 Q7. Will a proposal be required or can a contractor submit a GSA Schedule? A7. This acquisition is not being procured through a GSA Schedule. Therefore a proposal should be submitte d in accordance with the synopsis posted to the ASFI/FedBizOpps website on 31 August 2005. Q8. Would the Government consider a different NAICS code for this procurement? A8. The current NAICS code, 541611, best reflects the type of effort described in the PWS. No waivers will be granted.  Q9.  What is the expectation on the part of C-E LCMC Acquisition Center, in terms of number of personnel (minimum & maximum) that is made available to complete this project in the span of four months as required? A9.  The contractor should determine the necessary number of personnel.  However, offerors are cautioned that the Government will only provide facilities for up to three (3) employees. Q10. What is the average age of the Contracts to be closed? Are they fairly current? A10.  The contractor can expect a variety of contracts to be closed out.  No further information will be given in regards to the contracts to be closed. Q11. Are all the Government Task Leads/Action Officers located at Fort Monmouth? A11.  No information regarding this question will be released. Q12.  Is this currently being performed by the Government or a contractor?  If contracted out, who is the incumbent? A12.  Viatech Inc. is currently supporting this effort.

<RESPDATE>091305
<ARCHDATE>11122005
<CONTACT>Kathryn McCune, 301-619-1354
<DESC>ANSWERS TO VENDOR QUESTIONS Reference: Wide Area Virtual Environment (W81XWH-05-T-0703) 1) It doent appear as if installation and configuration is included in this RFQ.  Does USUHS want the responders to include pricing for this as part of the initial response? A: Installation and configuration is not required.  However, technical support to USUHS personnel for the initial setup and configuration must be provided. 2) The RFQ appears to have conflicting specifications regarding screen aspect ratio (5:4) and minimum projector resolution, 1024x768 (4:3).  There are several solutions which are available to solve this conflict, please provide the desired option  or spec ify an alternative one:  A: The intent is to have the 2x2 array of projectors cover all of the screen without borders after edge blending.  To the extent that it is necessary to accomplish this, the screen and projector aspect ratios can be changed.  However, the screen size must match the original dimensions as closely as possible. 3) The customer does not call out how much edge-blending (overlapping) is desired or acceptable in the solution.  Are there minimum or maximum figures for this?  Alternatively, what is the on-screen resolution desired by the customer (this will dictate the  overlap)?  A: A minimum 10% overlap is required with 15% being optimal. 4) Can you elaborate on The requirements must be taken as an integrated set.  For accountability, a single vendor must be responsible for all support, maintenance, and warranty issues .  In other words, does the second sentence expand and clarify the fir st or are they not entirely related?    A: All equipment maintenance, technical support, and warranty requirements should be the responsibility of, and be supported by, a single vendor. 5) Can you clarify with the customer whether or not these projection systems should include mounting systems (adjustable brackets, a way to connect with the screen, etc.)?  Or is the customer expecting to arrange these systems by themselves?  If brackets/m ounting systems are desirable, would the customer prefer that these units be moveable?  A: The projection systems should include mounting systems.  The screens and their mounts should facilitate repositioning so that inter-screen angles can be any value between 0 to 90 degrees. 6) Is there a delivery timeframe from receipt of order that must be met?  I see the phrase delivery date: September 29, 2005; however that seems to conflict with the anticipated award date of the same day.  Please clarify.  A: Because of certain government requirements, this contract must be awarded no later than Sept. 30, 2005, hence the Sept. 29, 2005 award date. See the answer to question 11 regarding deliverables. 7) I have found a storage mechanism (0001A) however the size is .3 larger than the requested spec.  If we quote this item will that disqualify our response?  A: This is fine. 8) As a vendor who has significant experience in display systems, we believe that a fully integrated and installed solution will meet the customers needs more than what has been listed in the RFQ.  Is it desirable for us to propose a more complete system which improves the usability and quality of the solution while meeting or exceeding the contents of the RFQ?    A: An integrated and installed system meeting or exceeding the stated requirements falls within the scope of the RFQ.  However, the cost should be competitive. 9) Will companies with local sales and support offices be regarded more favorably than other responders?  A: This requirement is on FedBizOpps so anyone can provide a proposal. Only the aspects detailed under the Evaluation Criteria portion of the Synopsis will be used to compare submitted proposals. 10) Will companies with systems on a GSA contract be regarded more favorably than other responders?  A: See answer for question 9. 11) How long will be permit to build such a system? A: Deliverables should be due at USUHS not later than 3 months after contract award. 12) Does this solicitation include the installation of the stereo projection system?  A: No, however, technical support to USUHS staff for the initial install, calibration, and configuration must be provided. 13) What kind of the screen? Flat or curved? If flat, do they put in a straight low or in a fixed angle between each other? A: The screens will be flat. Inter-screen angle can be at any value between 0 and 90 deg.  The screens must facilitate repositioning after they have been set up. 14) How is the application software development on this VR system? Since we also provide VR software services, can we provide such services for them? A: At present, only a hardware solution is required. 15)  The requirements for the workstations state that overclocking of the bus clock and CPU clock are necessary.  The CPU clock is dependant on the bus clock so overclocking the bus clock will automatically overclock the CPU clock.  Do you perhaps mean CPU  multiplier adjusting?  A: Yes, we do mean an adjustable CPU multiplier. 16)  Another requirement is for liquid cooling.  Is this for noise abatement only?  Liquid cooling requires a lot of maintenance when compared to very quiet fans.  The AMD CPU's don't generate enough heat to require water cooling so I would recommend just using a quiet fan/heatsink cooling solution.  A: Liquid cooling is desirable to provide the heat transport and dissipation necessary for aggressive overclocking with the minimum amount of noise.  To the extent possible, cooling fans should not be used, so a liquid cooling solution that includes the CP U, northbridge, and GPUs would be highly desirable. 17)  If water cooling is indeed necessary, are you looking for a solution like the one at this URL: http://www.thermaltake.com/xaserCase/taichi/vb5001sna/vb5001sna.htm ?  The feature that I'm most interested in learning about is a requirement for the syste m to be internal to the CPU case.  Is it necessary for the solution to be internal to the CPU case or can the cooling solution be located outside of the case?  A: The actual placement of the radiator is not essential.  The key requirements are both low noise and heat dissipation.  To that end, the proposed solution given by the URL above is not optimal, given that it cools only the CPU, there appears to be no red uction in the number of fans utilized (in fact, additional fans appear necessary), and there does not appear to be any consideration for noise abatement.   18)  The solicitation reads like the winner would be responsible for installing a complete projection solution including monitors, audio, screens, projectors, etc.  In addition, it looks like the requirement is for a back projected system.  This requires s ome careful planning, much more so than a traditionally projected system.  We may need to see this room to make some recommendations and take some measurements.  How do we go about this?  A: The proposed system will be used in an experimental setting.  As such, frequent reconfiguration can be expected, depending on the current focus.  Installation by the vendor is not a requirement for this solicitation.  However, technical support for the initial setup, configuration, and calibration must be provided

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  All clauses contained herein, except where specified otherwise,  can be viewed at either of the following web addresses: http://www.arnet.gov/far/loadmainre.html (FAR Only) http://farsite.hill.af.mil/ (FAR and DFARs) http://www.arl.army.mil/contracts/RepsCerts.doc (Additional Clauses not found above; also, copy of the Representations and Certifications) 		(ii)  The solicitation number is W911QX-05-T-0205.  This acquisition is issued as an request for quote (RFQ).  		(iii)  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04. 		(iv)  This acquisition is being conducted as a small-business set-aside.   		(v)   The following is a list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure, (including option(s), if applicable): CLIN 0001	MICROSCOPE SYSTEM			QTY 1	EACH CLIN 0002	SHIPPING (IF NOT FOB DESTINATION)	QTY 1	EACH 		State on offer if FOB Destination or FOB Origin (vi)  Description of requirements: System Overview US Army Research Laboratory isrequesting an acoustic microscope imaging system that is appropriate for an analytical laboratory installation.  The system must perform A-scan, B-Scan, and C-scans using a variety of ultrasonic transducers. In a scanning acoustic microscope images are generated by raster scanning a transducer across the surface, which sends and receives ultrasonic signals.  These signals are then stored as an amplitude plot.  Each plot represents a specific location over the part being scanned and together these plots form a database of the devices interior reflections.   The time-amplitude data is called an A-scan.  Setting the time of the first reflection as a reference point creates the front surface of the object to be sc anned.  A technique to track this front surface is required.  The reflection times after this reference time represent specific depth planes within the part. The ability to control the time slice after the front surface is called gating, and is used to gen erate the amplitude maps.  The maximum possible gating positions possible from each manufacturer are requested. A map of the device should be built from the stored waveform data.  Specific time slices from the waveform data should allow the construction of an amplitude map at a specific depth within the section. This amplitude map is called a C-scan. Gaps, such as d elaminations and voiding within the bond region cause a complete reflection of ultrasonic energy.  These defects should appear as bright areas in the C-scan image. SPECIFIC MICROSCOPE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS System Features: 1) High precision scanner motors for transducer. (0.5 micron resolution) 2) Large sample tank for scanning large devices. (i.e. 20 x 20) 3) Through  transmission kit (with receiver) for scanning through plastic and thick samples.
