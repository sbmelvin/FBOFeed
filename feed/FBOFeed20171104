“Component” means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into an end product.

(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or
(2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product.

(1) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United States;
(2) An end product manufactured in the United States, if—
(i) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components.

(c) Offerors may obtain from the Contracting Officer a list of foreign articles that the Contracting Officer will treat as domestic for this contract.
(d) The Contractor shall deliver only domestic end products except to the extent that it specified delivery of foreign end products in the provision of the solicitation entitled “Buy American Certificate.”<BR><BR>As prescribed in 25.1101(a)(2), insert the following provision:

NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. AVSUP Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community.

The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator. The integrator has the necessary operational, design, configuration management, integration and engineering knowledge when purchasing, building and repairing Q-70 parts for hosted systems. ***SOURCE APPROVAL*** LOCKHEED MARTIN IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY FOR THESE ITEMS.

Also included are photos of similar demolition by mobile crane removal from 1997 as well as 2017 photos of recent condition.</p>
<p>The upstream cable has failed near the northeast anchor block. The other main suspension cable remains suspending most of the failed structure but its condition and structural capacity is unknown. The northeast tower has rotated off 2 of the 3 pedestal supports and is unstable. All concrete foundations and anchor assemblies are to remain in place except for salvage of a single anchor assembly. All suspension cables, suspenders, hardware and pressure treated wood elements are to be removed and disposed of off National Forest System Lands.</p>
<p>Disassemble and remove in a manner that does not alter flowing water or scarify the stream channel, gravel bars, banks or flood plain. Machinery and debris shall not be allowed in the active stream. Use of the gravel bar for staging and by machinery is allowed if not covered in water. Any vegetation cleared from gravel bar to facilitate operations is to be slash piled in an area above the high water mark and approved by the CO. Likely east of the southwest tower location.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.
