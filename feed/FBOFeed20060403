<DESC>Description:   The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for the proposed sole source contractor, the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, to collect, summarize and report existing data related to intensive bull trout telemetry tracking, fixed site data offloading, genetics and habitat data collection in lakes and rivers in the Yakima River Basin, Washington.  Work includes a continuation of a study already underway to maintain compatible data sets with previous surveys performed by Reclamation and the Washington (State) Department of Fish and Wildlife Service.   The Washington (State) Department of Fish and Wildlife is a state agency with access to internal documentation on state fisheries activities since this inception of this ongoing study.  Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) has in-house technical expertise in performing analysis of fisheries and telemetry data coupled with the access to extensive WA state data unavailable in its current form to Reclamation or the private sector at large.  WDFW can analyze and produce a report on effects of current Reclamation operations and structures on the federally threatened bull trout proximate to Reclamation facilities.  Additionally WDFW has telemetry gear and training to operate it such that present data collection can be made compatible with previous tracking surveys. WDFW is the state management agency of the natural resources and is in the best position to compile existing data analyses with their management perspective.  This report and surveys cannot be obtained nor run by any individual private entity.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the scope of this requirement.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms believing they can execute this requirement shall submit supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirement. This is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer.  Responses should include the firm's DUN and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 541990 which is $6 Million.

The contractor shall test the modified 870 lbf engine with Lox/methane to verify acceptability of the design modifications for testing at WSTF. The delivery date is June 30, 2006. 3) The contractor shall then modify the two engines at WSTF in place at WSTF. The delivery date is June 30, 2006.  4) The contractor shall insure that there is spare hardware for a fourth LO2/Methane 870 lbf RCE that is in a state ready for assembly. This includes two spare chambers. The delivery date is August 1, 2006. NASA/GRC intends to obtain these requirements from Aerojet General Corp., at P.O. Box 1322, Sacramento, CA  95813-6000. A.) Aerojet is the original equipment manufacturer for this igniter hardware.  This additional hardware will provide NASA the capability to perform In-House Battleship Testing and augment the level of knowledge with respect to cryogenic propulsion systems. It would also be impractical and impossible for another company to manufacture this design without the use of proprietary manufacturing processes for the platelet injector. B.) Through previous competition Aerojet was selected as the contractor for the development of the 870 lbf Lox/Ethanol Engines that were tested at NASA’s White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) in Las Cruces, NM. Aerojet is best qualified, with the original engineers who designed the hardware, to perform the following tasks: •	Modify the main injector •	Refurbish four main fuel valves for methane  •	Test the modified 870 lbf engine with Lox/methane to verify acceptability •	Modify the two engines at WSTF in place at WSTF It would be impractical and not cost effective to the Government to have another company develop the experience and tooling to provide the above modifications to existing hardware.  C.) Aerojet is the only one that can provide the spare hardware that was manufactured under a contract that was just recently concluded. Lastly, all of this hardware is either duplicate from hardware developed under a recent contract for NASA or duplicate hardware that will be developed during the base period of the recent contract that was competitivly solicited.  The intention of this approach is to be as cost effective as possible in order to reduce additional unnecessary costs to the government The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a continuing requirement for researching and developing digital control for power electronics using Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) design Methods. This procurement involves membership status for the university to develop and maintain a facility whereby University capabilities can be used to advance Power Electronic systems, to stimulate industrial innovation and to provide the University with enhanced research capability to related subjects.  The Colorado Power Electronics Center (CoPEC) shall extend the development of the active-stability control technology developed under NNC05QA01P to include the determination and/or measurement of DC-DC converter health state. This health state measurement will be performed in-situ and continuously reported at 5 minute) intervals to a supervisory avionics controller. Work products and deliverables will include a hardware breadboard technology demonstration and all documentation including theory, techniques, test results, and conference/journal papers.  NASA/GRC intends to purchase Full Sponsoring Memberships from the University of Colorado, at Boulder, 3100 Marine Street, Boulder, Colorado 80309 for a base period of 12 months with potentially two options periods, each 12 months.   The University's Colorado Power Electronics Center (CoPEC) is the only technology consortium in the United States that is researching and developing digital control for power electronics using Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design methods. NASA has determined that digital control of power electronics is a high priority since analog, radiation hardened electronic devices will not be available for future space exploration missions. The ASIC technology being developed for power electronics at CoPEC makes that possible. The membership is an on-going effort and has been extended to a three year period if necessary.  The renewal of the CoPEC membership means that NASA will benefit from the continuity of an existing research effort. Finally, the technology sharing agreement with the commercial CoPEC partners means that technology developed for NASA can quickly transition into commercial applications.  The effort used to compete such a requirement would only provide the information known of the one source and take unnecessary actions costing NASA money and time.the items from  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a sole source purchase order to Morgan State University National Transportation Center (NTC) to support the development of an analytical tool to better integrate Environmental Justice (EJ) analysis into the transportation planning process.  The objectives of this project: (1) to be responsible to the concerns raised by the Baltimore Region in Phase I of the Baltimore Regional Environmental Justice in Transportation Project and work toward identifying reasonable solutions to environmental justice and transportation concerns, and to gain sufficient insight in addressing these concerns to create a planning guide, or toolkit, for use by others locally or nationally.  FHWA evaluated organizations to perform the work of developing technical analysis tools for evaluating EJ issues in the Baltimore area and found that Morgan State University National Transportation Center is the organization that has a unique capability to perform this work.  

The project team will include Morgan State University’s NTC, the Baltimore Metropolitan Council, the Greater Baltimore Urban League and John Hopkins University Hospital.  Morgan State University’s NTC has the experience to bring these unique partners together to accomplish this service.  No other known source can provide the required service.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about 
April 17, 2006.

<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the Institute of Agri-Food and Land Use, Queen’s University Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 5AG for Six (6) PSP Coated Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) CM5 Biosensor Chips, Four (4) each Monoclonal Antibodies to PSP Toxins, Two (2) each PSP Toxin-Protein Conjugates.

Queen’s University Belfast (QUB) has developed a proprietary method to produce research grade CM5 biosensor chips for PSP toxin detection using a Biacore SPR instrument, which NOAA currently operates.  There is no other company/institute able to produce a PSP toxin biosensor chip to these, or any other, specifications.  As part of this SPR-based toxin detection system, Queen’s University Belfast has also developed unique monoclonal antibodies that show cross-reaction among multiple known PSP toxin congeners and are compatible with the biosensor chips.  Such antibodies are not commercially available elsewhere.  The saxitoxin-protein conjugates designed and developed by the Queen’s University Belfast have been demonstrated to bind their monoclonal antibodies for PSP toxins, and NOAA will be able to use these unique antibody/conjugate pairings in its development of in-water toxin detection technologies for the PSP toxins.

 This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.

FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation w!  ill contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather info!  rmation you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the officia l version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam !  Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) in a negotiated procurement for the preservation of photographic holdings of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Pacific Region-San Francisco, 1000 Commodore Drive, San Bruno CA 94066.  NARA Pacific Region-San Francisco is responsible for the identification and preservation of records in archival holdings in the region.  A typical series will include  such record types as photographic prints and negatives, slides, engineering drawings, maps, various oversize materials, and/or other nontextual records. The series concerned in the initial phase of the contract are photographs created by the US Forest Service between the early 1900’s and 1964, and processed under Record Group 095.  These photographs document Pacific Southwest Region National Forest and Research/Experiment Station work. Such records currently get medium to high use.  The series records are generally arranged according to the National Forest or type of work done, and by accession, and thereunder numerically or chronologically. During processing, a finding aid documenting nontextual preservation work performed and the resulting sequence of the records will be created. 

Within the containers, the photographs are stored in varying conditions, mostly mounted on paper cards containing valuable descriptive information, with accompanying envelopes for duplicates. The photographs are often accompanied by negatives, and in some cases paper and glass slides are also included.  The items are mostly 5”x8”. (i.e. 3.5” x 5.5” photos mounted on 5” x 8” envelopes)

Records for the initial period consist of approximately 30 cubic feet of photographs stored in acidic FRC boxes.  There are approximately 12,500 original photographs and images plus duplicates.

Specifically, the Contractor shall serve as a scientific writer to review, edit, and provide guidance throughout the Government’s publication clearance process for the following publications: 1) “Handout on Health: Pediatric Rhumatics Diseases”; 2) “Handout on Health: Osteoporosis”; 3) “Question and Answer about Bursitis/Tendonitis”;  4) “Questions and Answers about Arthritis and Diet”;  5) “Question and Answer about Pemphigus”; 6) “Emerging issues facts sheet: Clinical Trials”  7) Emerging issues facts sheet: “Cartilage Tissue Regeneration”; and 8) Other publications and activities, as needed.    Place of Performance: The work may be performed primarily at the Contractor’s work site.   Period of Performance: The proposed period of performance is one (1) year from the date of contract award.   The Government has estimated 528 hours labor hours for the performance of the tasks for this requirement.

<DESC>100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics, and Prevention Research (DESPR) at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIHCD) conducts epidemiologic, behavioral and biometric studies relating to reproductive, maternal, and child health.  The Division consists of the Biometry and Mathematical Statistics Branch, the Epidemiology Branch, and the Prevention Research Branch.  Studies focus on reproductive processes, pregnancy, infant mortality and morbidity, child growth and development, clinical trials, vaccinology, and community-based interventions designed to promote healthy behaviors.  These studies make use of a variety of research strategies including surveys, observational designs, randomized trials, and demonstration/education projects.  

In the past half century, labor and delivery practice has been guided by the Friedman curve. However, labor management has changed substantially during that period.   Several findings strongly indicate that new, evidence-based definitions of labor protraction and arrest are needed.   In order to establish new definitions, two important issues must be addressed.  First, what is the average range of labor progression in current population?  Second, although we can increase the time limits for the definition of labor protraction and arrest and allow labor to go longer before intervention, is it safe for the mother and the fetus?  The NICHD intends to conduct a retrospective observational study using data already collected in many hospitals and healthcare organizations in the United States to: (1) to describe contemporary labor progression in the U.S. population; and (2) to determine the appropriate time to perform a Cesarean delivery for women with labor protraction and arrest. The answers to these questions will have profound impacts on obstetric practice.

The NICHD is soliciting proposals from qualified Small Business Concerns to serve as a Data Coordinating Center for the observational study.  Specifically, the successful Contractor shall seek collaboration from institutions that have a comprehensive obstetric database and electronically stored, detailed labor information.  The institutions will also have a neonatal database on every newborn that records severe neonatal complications, and linkable to the obstetric and newborn databases.  The purpose of the resultant contract will be to compile and deliver a substantial database with approximately 200,000 deliveries from up to 20 hospitals for research and to form a NICHD Consortium on Safe Labor.

This procurement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Therefore, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this procurement is 500 employees or less.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/  for information on what is a Small Business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates number of employees.  All responsible sources that meet the applicable Small Business Size Standard may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NICHD.  

The NICHD anticipates issuing one award for a 30-month completion-type contract, with three separate Phases, for this procurement.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about January 10, 2006 through the FedBizOpps website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  

All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, NICHD R&D Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).  The reference number to be used for this announcement is: RFP-NIH-NICHD-2006-03. All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided. Questions may be directed by telephone to Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, at (301) 435-6960.

The Government does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP.  The Government also reserves the right to cancel this procurement at any time prior to contract award.  This announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

As part of the state’s Policy for Management of Information Technology, ETICE is charged with planning the creation of a new state government data center that would upgrade and consolidate the various state secretariats’ data centers with the participation of the private sector, either under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) or some form of a traditional outsourcing contract.  The principal driver behind the project is the need to meet the growing demand for information and communication technology (ICT) to support the state’s e-government applications, services and portals with greater efficiency and flexibility.

The State of Ceará Data Center project involves the creation of a modern, secure data center that would consolidate all state government’s “back-office” corporate IT infrastructure, such as corporate servers, storage, network equipment, software, and support and operational staff that share common functions. Secretariats will continue to maintain some back-office infrastructure related to their sector or agency-specific functions. Eventually even “noncommon” applications may be migrated to the centralized data center.  ETICE is also interested in studying the economies of scale that could be gained by allowing the state data center to provide services to private sector clients.

The feasibility study will help ETICE develop more accurate costs estimates for the project, estimate future demand for data center services, propose service level agreements, recommend equipment to meet the projected demand. A key output of the feasibility study will be a recommendation regarding whether it is more advantageous to implement the project as a PPP or conventional service contract.   A summary of the main tasks of the terms of reference is as follows:

•	Conduct Background Research
•	Carry out Needs/Requirement Analysis of the Data Center
•	Develop Functional Specifications, Architecture, and Data Center Design
•	Review Legal and Regulatory Issues Related to PPPs
•	Conduct Economic and Financial Analysis
•	Assess Organizational Preparedness 
•	Conduct Environmental Assessment
•	Carry out Development Impact Analysis
•	Develop Project Implementation Plan
•	Prepare and Present Final Report.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a road equipment requirements and maintenance Feasibility Study for the tsunami affected areas in Sri Lanka.

The Asian tsunami of December 2004 highlighted the lack of sufficient transport infrastructure in the east of Sri Lanka, as well as in the south.  Multilateral and other development banks active in tsunami reconstruction in Sri Lanka (Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and Japan International Cooperation Agency) have pledged large assistance packages for major road rehabilitation construction projects, but the availability of sufficient equipment and trained equipment operators remains a concern.  

The project sponsor for the Study would be the Ministry of Highways (MOH).  The MOH has overall responsibility for programs and projects for national highways.  The Road Development Authority (RDA), a statutory institution assigned to MOH, is responsible for planning and managing the development of national highways and for maintenance.  In practice RDA operates as a government department under MOH, with relatively limited autonomy.  

The objective of the proposed Study is to identify road construction and maintenance equipment needs, particularly in the tsunami-affected areas in Sri Lanka, and how to best meet the needs in the future.  The Study includes looking into various mechanisms for equipment procurement and distribution such as the establishment of public-private partnerships for leasing equipment to the local road construction industry.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $367,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>The contractor shall provide all materials, labor, tools, equipment, facilities, transportation and supervision to expand the emergency room located in Building 100 at the Veterans Affairs Health Care Center in Palo Alto California.  The work consists but is not limited to:  phased selective demolition; phased general construction; temporary protection; facilities and services; alterations; and mechanical, plumbing; fire protection; medical gases and vacuum system; and electrical work of the emergency room.  Expansion area is located on the ground floor of building 100.  Work shall also include patching and restoration of existing and modified space as well as subsequent construction. Period of Performance: 365 calendar days from receipt of the Notice To Proceed. Magnitude of Construction: between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. Solicitation and Project Plans will be available May 1, 2006. NOTICE OF CASCADING SET-ASIDE The solicitation will be a cascading set-aside solicitation.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.14, any award resulting from this solicitation, will be made on a competitive basis to eligible SDVOB concerns, provided that a minimum of two (2) competitive (technical and cost) offers are received from eligible SDVOB concerns. If a minimum of two (2) offers from eligible SDVOB concerns are not received, the award for the services/supplies specified within the solicitation will be made to an 8(a) business concern in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.8, provided that a minimum of two competitive (technical and cost) offers are received from eligible 8(a) concerns. If a minimum of two (2) offers from eligible 8(a) concerns are not received for the services/supplies specified within the solicitation, the award will be made  to a HUBZone business concern in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.13, provided that a minimum of two competitive (technical and cost) offers are received from eligible HUBZone concerns.  If a minimum of two (2) offer from eligible HUBZone concerns are not received for the services/services specified within the solicitation, the award will be made to a small business concern in accordance with FAR subpart 19.5, provided that a minimum of two (2) competitive (technical and cost) offers are received from eligible small business.  If a minimum of two (2) offers from eligible small business concerns are not received, then award will be made on the basis of full and open competition from among all responsible businesses submitting offers." Therefore, in the event that only one (1) competitive offer is received from either an SDVOB, 8(a), HUBZone, or small business concern, that offer may not necessarily be awarded under the procedures of the applicable FAR subpart.  However, it should be noted that SDVOB, 8(a), and HUBZone concerns are also small business concerns, and may be considered for award, provided the proposal is competitive.  For example, if one (1) SDVOB concern, one (1) 8(a) concern and one (1) Large Business concern submitted competitive (technical and cost) proposals in response to the solicitation, then because both the SDVOB and the 8(a) concern are also small business concerns, the offer of the Large Business concern will not be considered even though its offer may be lower in price than either the SDVOB or 8(a) concern. In contrast, if one (1) 8(a) concern and one (1) Large Business concern each submitted competitive (technical and cost) proposals, then both proposals would be considered for award, because a minimum of two (2) proposals were not received from small business concerns.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Health (NIH), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives.  The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  In this context, the NIAID's mission includes the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations.  These biological agents have been prioritized as Category A, B, and C.  Through this solicitation the NIAID is seeking to advance the development of therapeutics against selected NIAID Category A, B, and C bacterial pathogens via a focused, staged approach. Specifically the goal of this solicitation is to develop new, safe, and effective therapeutics for:

* Bacillus anthracis
* Yersinia pestis
* Francisella tularensis
* Burkholderia pseudomallei
* Burkholderia mallei
* Rickettsia prowazekii

Pathogens, excluding sexually-transmitted organisms (see http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/anti_stis.htm for list of excluded organisms), resistant to antimicrobial agents were recently added to the NIAID Biodefense Category C priority pathogens list. This solicitation will also support the development of candidate therapeutics with broad spectrum activity against NIAID Category C antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogen(s) and at least one of the selected Category A or B bacterial pathogens (B. anthracis, Y. pestis, F. tularensis, B. pseudomallei, B. mallei and R. prowazekii). 

The candidate therapeutic should be at a stage of development that is minimally within five (5) years of completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial.  This solicitation will support non-clinical studies, medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and other Investigational New Drug (IND)-, New Drug Application (NDA)-, or Biologic License Application (BLA)-enabling studies.  The NIAID is particularly interested in candidate therapeutics that have broad spectrum activity and are within the regulatory purview of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of up to five (5) years beginning on or about June 12, 2007.  BAA NIH-NIAID-DMID-07-37 will be available electronically on or about March 31, 2006 and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (AO) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

NIAID/OA Home Page (via the WWW): Use http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract to access the NIAID/AO Home Page. Once at the NIAID/AO Home Page, click on the "RFPs" link and then click on "BAA NIH-NIAID-DMID-07-37, entitled, 'Development of Therapeutic Agents for Selected Biodefense Bacterial Diseases'."  

Proposals will be due on or about September 12, 2006.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal for consideration by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-wide numbered note 26.

Sources Sought Notice ---

Description

The Information Technology Center (ITC), under the direction of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, and Office of Chief Information Officer within the Department of Labor is requesting information for market research for a printer buying vehicle for its customer base. 

The ITC serves 23 DOL Agencies through the Employee Computer Network (ECN).  The ECN has approximately 3500 Local Area (LAN) connected networked desktops at the Washington DC and regional offices through-out the US.  Regional offices include approximately 800 remote access workstations.  Also, numerous employees have laptops for working off-site. Note that OASAM ECN has a decentralized budget for IT purchasing.

While the ITC maintains a certified list of printers, it has not formally consolidated nor standardized its printers.  In the past year, the ITC has encouraged customers, via internal market research efforts, to utilize the certification and recommended printer lists.  The environment has both network and local printers.  Approximately 300 of the environment’s printers are estimated to be networked, and the remaining printers are estimated to be local. 

Objectives
The ITC requires a range of printer hardware that can function on the OASAM ECN network, effectively serve large and small agencies, as well as meet the customers’ business requirements.  Hardware, peripherals, maintenance agreements, and minimal service related to customer requirements analysis may be required.   Assistance with an initial assessment may be also required.

ITC seeks to provide a streamlined and cost effective purchasing vehicle for its customer base to:
•	continuously improve its hardware to keep up with technological standards  
•	to reduce ITC maintenance costs and to reduce the hardware variability in the environment to obtain a more supportable customer base and lifecycle management
•	to better assist the customer in selecting the appropriate hardware for their business needs
•	to ensure that all hardware meets the minimum Section 508 requirements

Specifications and Requirements
Given the rapid change in the overall printer technology today and as the ITC transitions to increasingly complex technology, the following generally outlines the specifications required for the ITC.

•	The hardware must be able to accommodate advances in our infrastructure, cabling, communication lines and other network hardware.  The customer business requirements are presently under evaluation, but targets of 80 percent solution are desirable.
•	The hardware must be able to meet or be adaptable to Section 508 for disabled employees, as required.
•	On occasion, intermittent to high volume deployment of hardware to meet ECN customer demand, and shipping to regional or other off-site offices as requested
•	Regular updates on model upgrades, product discontinuations, or any shift in product technology that may will impact the ability to certify the product on the OASAM network, desktop compatibility, 508 requirements, and/or the customer’s ability to obtain supplies reasonably and at a cost effective price.
•	Evaluation units must be available
•	Considering the present decentralized purchasing environment, direct purchasing may be most apparent solution, however leasing will also be considered.
•	Scanner and scanner solutions may be added in the near future.
•	The following is a general breakdown of printer types for the environment:

Local	         Network
 Color	          Color
Monochrome	Monochrome
Multi-function	Multi-function
Low volume	Low volume
High volume	High volume


Instruction for Responses
Respondents should submit a concise Statement of Interest, no more than 5 pages in length.   Respondents should demonstrate sound knowledge in the printer hardware and service industry, IT consolidation and standardization, and any previous experience with the federal civilian sector (printer) consolidation efforts. 

Please note that OASAM/ITC is not requesting budgetary information, a proposal detailed plans, or proprietary information for this request.

The closing date for the receipt of responses is April 17, 2006, at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.  Send your responses to Sheila Thompson, Contract Negotiator at the following e-mail address: Thompson.sheila@dol.gov.    The government reserves the right to compete any acquisition related to this sources sought notice using information from this survey among small businesses or to make award to an 8 (a) firm, based on the responses received.  This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for the information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.  No solicitation document exists at this time.   The NAICS Code identified for this requirement is 423430 with a size standard of 100 employees.

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer – Thomas Bikowski, 202-781-2819
<DESC>17.	The purpose of this announcement is to determine if there are interested sources for the replacement of solenoid-operated pilot valves (SOPV) currently in use aboard US Navy ships, or which may be used in future systems.  The valves are currently constructed in accordance NAVSEA Standard Drawing 803-5959218, and most commonly are installed in systems depicted in NAVSEA Standard Drawing 803-5959273.   These drawings may be referred to for an understanding of the functionality of the device, and its current mounting configuration.  Electronic copies of these drawings can be found at the Navy Logistics Library as follows: Go to:  http://www.nll.navsup.navy.mil/ Click:  PUBS/PRODUCTS/TOOLS Click:  NAVSUP DIGITAL DOCUMENTS Click:  Radio Button for NAVICP CONTRACT SUPPORT LIBRARY Click:  DOCUMENT TYPE drop down and select NAVSEA DOCUMENTS Click:  SEARCH Click:  DOCUMENT # SEA0010 Open:  Drawing 803-5959273 or Drawing 803-5959218D Note that mounting configuration and valve type shown, are not intended to indicate limitations at this point.  Instead, this information is to provide an understanding of the functionality of the device and interface connections in existing systems.  The valves must be suitable for use in a Naval combatant ship.  The valve is subject to long periods during which it is not operated, up to several months, after which it may cycle several times in a day, and then be static again for several months.  The seawater being controlled by the valve is from the ship’s firemain (normally 150 to 175 lb/in2) and contains substantial contaminants due to the coarse strainers used in these systems.  While static, the valve would contain stagnant seawater from the ship’s firemain.  Current areas of concern with the SOPV are leakage through the valve shaft seal progressing into the area of the electrical operator, electro-mechanical interface alignment and ease with which the interface comes !  out of alignment.  Scoring of lapped surfaces from grit has also been a concern.  NAVSEA is particularly interested in designs which avoid the sliding surfaces which have been a problem in the past.  If a design has a plug or ball design, an explanation of why it should be considered satisfactory for this service should be provided.  Since the time to actuate an AFFF fire extinguishing system should be minimized, the time for the SOPV alternative to operate should also be minimized.  Responders are requested to address the time for their valve to operate.  Note that the current SOPV is a four-ported valve which in a few cases was deemed useful so that a single SOPV would control two valves simultaneously.  Due to the expected reduced cost of alternative units, NAVSEA is particularly interested in a unit which is only required to operate one valve at a time (a 3-ported valve).  Interested companies should submit, on company letterhead and no later than 2 May 2005, a notice o!  f interest including the name, telephone number, mailing address, and  e-mail address of one point of contact to Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Douglas Barylski SEA 05P4, 1333 Isaac Hull SE Mail Stop 5149, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-5149.  Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to Doug Barylski at 202-781-3612.  The notice of interest should include a brief description of your company and its capabilities and experience that relate to valve and/or mechanical device design and manufacture, brochures, top level drawings showing basic dimensions of possible devices, reliability data such as mean time between failure for proposed or similar devices, and any related information that will assist the Navy in assessing SOPV replacement possibilities.  Multiple alternatives for either future installation or backfit, or both, are welcomed.

<DESC>The subject RFP requires the prime contractor to provide data describing contemporary labor progression in the United States population and to compile and deliver a large database with data on 200,000 deliveries that is suitable for data analysis.  The data will need to be acquired by the resultant prime contractor from organizations that are considered “other than small businesses,” such as health care providers and hospitals, via the issuance of subcontracts.

As stated in the RFP, the Government estimates a total of 75% FTE per subcontract based on a subcontract that will be supplying 10,000 records.  Therefore, the Government’s subcontract effort estimate, as stated in the RFP for the estimated 20 subcontracts needed to supply the 200,000 records, equates to 31,200 hours (75% FTE per subcontractor * 20 subcontracts) based on a 2080 hour work year.  This total significantly exceeds the Governments’s total effort estimate for the prime contract of 12,376 hours (see Article L.1.e of the RFP).  As a result, the Government’s  total estimated cost of the Direct Labor for the subcontracts is also significantly more than the total estimated cost of Direct Labor for the prime contract.

Consequently, it has been concluded that there is virtually no chance that a small business offeror could provide a proposal with realistic and reasonable estimated Direct Labor costs for the prime contract and subcontracts that would not be in violation of the legal limitations on subcontracting for a Total Small Business Set Aside.  Specifically, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, states that, for services (except construction), at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern (i.e, prime contractor).  Therefore, the subject RFP is hereby changed from a Total Small Business Set Aside to full and open competition.  Please note that this action has been approved by the NIH Small Business Specialist and the Small Business Administration.

<DESC>100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.

The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics, and Prevention Research (DESPR) at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NIHCD) conducts epidemiologic, behavioral and biometric studies relating to reproductive, maternal, and child health.  The Division consists of the Biometry and Mathematical Statistics Branch, the Epidemiology Branch, and the Prevention Research Branch.  Studies focus on reproductive processes, pregnancy, infant mortality and morbidity, child growth and development, clinical trials, vaccinology, and community-based interventions designed to promote healthy behaviors.  These studies make use of a variety of research strategies including surveys, observational designs, randomized trials, and demonstration/education projects.  

In the past half century, labor and delivery practice has been guided by the Friedman curve. However, labor management has changed substantially during that period.   Several findings strongly indicate that new, evidence-based definitions of labor protraction and arrest are needed.   In order to establish new definitions, two important issues must be addressed.  First, what is the average range of labor progression in current population?  Second, although we can increase the time limits for the definition of labor protraction and arrest and allow labor to go longer before intervention, is it safe for the mother and the fetus?  The NICHD intends to conduct a retrospective observational study using data already collected in many hospitals and healthcare organizations in the United States to: (1) to describe contemporary labor progression in the U.S. population; and (2) to determine the appropriate time to perform a Cesarean delivery for women with labor protraction and arrest. The answers to these questions will have profound impacts on obstetric practice.

The NICHD is soliciting proposals from qualified Small Business Concerns to serve as a Data Coordinating Center for the observational study.  Specifically, the successful Contractor shall seek collaboration from institutions that have a comprehensive obstetric database and electronically stored, detailed labor information.  The institutions will also have a neonatal database on every newborn that records severe neonatal complications, and linkable to the obstetric and newborn databases.  The purpose of the resultant contract will be to compile and deliver a substantial database with approximately 200,000 deliveries from up to 20 hospitals for research and to form a NICHD Consortium on Safe Labor.

This procurement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  Therefore, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this procurement is 500 employees or less.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/  for information on what is a Small Business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates number of employees.  All responsible sources that meet the applicable Small Business Size Standard may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NICHD.  

The NICHD anticipates issuing one award for a 30-month completion-type contract, with three separate Phases, for this procurement.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about January 10, 2006 through the FedBizOpps website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  

All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, NICHD R&D Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).  The reference number to be used for this announcement is: RFP-NIH-NICHD-2006-03. All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided. Questions may be directed by telephone to Charles Newman, Contracting Officer, at (301) 435-6960.

<DESC>This purpose of this modification is to add an additional topic area as follows.  No other changes have been made.

The Information Directorate is soliciting white papers for the ability to perform technology assessment, demonstration, and transfer of USAF intelligence exploitation technology for local, state, and national law enforcement agencies.  Of particular interest are the USAF intelligence exploitation technologies, as a minimum, related to audio processing, video surveillance, and timeline analysis.

The purpose of audio processing technologies is to allow speaker identification, elimination of noise and/or multiple voices, enhancement and identification of background noise. The purpose of video surveillance technologies and tools is to enable the acquisition, processing, storage, and enhancement of video data to support law enforcement activities, such as identification of individuals, vehicles, events, and interactions.  Timeline analysis technologies are needed to provide both pattern/trend analysis for investigations, and to enhance logistics and planned coverage of regions for increased effectiveness of law enforcement resources. In addition, there is a need for timeline analysis tools which would allow the user multiple customizable ways to display location, time, interaction and event data.
This topic area also requires the validation of forensic tools utilized by FAVIAU and the FBI field offices for audio and video examination/analysis.  These validation procedures may be incorporated into FBI Forensic Audio Video Imagery Analysis Unit (FAVIAU) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for digital evidence examination and analysis.

It will be necessary for offerors to have, or have access to a Government-approved facility under this topic area therefore the security requirements outlined in the BAA also apply to this topic area.

As part of this effort monthly meeting will be held to stay abreast of the latest in technological advances in the areas of audio processing, video surveillance, and timeline analysis.
Part of this effort is to accelerate the process of transferring USAF developed technologies to the law enforcement/public safety market as well as to explore and apply scientifically proven methods to gather, process, and interpret digital evidence. Technology demonstrations/evaluations will be accomplished in a real world environment.  Best practices and lessons learned of those evaluations will be fed back to technology development programs and disseminated to the criminal justice community.
It is recommended that white papers for this additional topic area be provided by 24 April 2006 and addressed to:  ATTN:  Jonathan Gregory, AFRL/IFEC, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505.  The technical point of contact for this topic area is Ms. Misty Blowers, AFRL/IFEC, 315-330-3438, email Misty.Blowers@rl.af.mil.

FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL/IFTB is interested in  development of advanced knowledge acquisition tools to allow Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to understand knowledge entry, allow knowledge to be collated from different SMEs, and allow knowledge to be validated and maintained in a more simplified and efficient manner than the current state of the art. Achieving advances in this area is key to providing the information superiority necessary for future DoD mission success.    The overall objective of this BAA is to develop easy to use knowledge acquisition tools and techniques to allow SMEs to enter their knowledge efficiently into knowledge-based reasoning systems with minimal help from knowledge engineers.   These technologies should enable knowledge-based systems to easily encode SME knowledge to meet the needs of communities in their knowledge system environments.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 05-04-IFKA

CFDA Number:  12.800 

DATES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 5 Apr 05; FY 06 by 1 Mar 06; FY 07 by 1 Mar 07; and FY08 by 15 Oct 07.  White papers will be accepted until 2 p.m. Eastern time on 1 Mar 08, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

DESCRIPTION:  Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/IF, in conjunction with the Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA), is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase our knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of  Network Attack Traceback, to include beta testing of prototype capabilities.  Solutions to basic and applied  research and engineering traceback problems using innovative approaches are sought.   This includes high-risk, high-payoff capabilities for non-cooperative and/or hostile network environments. The scope of this effort concerns the development of various tools and techniques that provide capabilities which will increase our knowledge of the true source of a network attack, ideally to the originating host, using solely technical means.  We are particularly interested in tracing attacks that would compromise the confidentiality and integrity of information on Intelligence Community (IC) networks.  These IC networks include the NIPRNET, SIPRNET, JWICS, and IC enclaves.  Techniques designed for tracing Denial-of-Service attacks in IC networks are NOT the focus of this BAA, nor are techniques that involve probabalistic packet marking. ARDA is especially interested in traceback techniques for attacks launched with single packets involving encrypted payloads, chaff and other obfuscation techniques. 
Research efforts under this program are expected to result in complete functional capabilities ideally addressing both the collection and analysis aspects of the traceback problem.  However, projects specializing in highly novel and interesting techniques for just collection or just analysis will also be considered, if deemed to be of "breakthrough" quality and importance.  The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through preplanned testing and evaluation activities.  Technologies that can be transitioned for operational use, particularly within the IC, are of high interest. 
Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work efficiently. 
Offerors are encouraged to submit classified white papers via the appropriate channels.  Contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII.  
SCOPE:  The scope of this effort concerns the development of various tools and techniques to increase our knowledge of the true source of a network attack. The areas of interest include the broad range of tools and techniques to traceback the network attack to the originating Local Area Network, the attacker's Internet Service Provider, or an originating Autonomous System with the goal of identifying the specific host which launched the attack. Deliverables will be technical reports, software, demonstrations, and results of experiments which provide evidence and metrics concerning the assertions/claims about the research. Demonstrations may involve exploratory development models (ie brassboards) if appropriate.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $10M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $400K; FY 06 - $3.6M.  Additional funding of $3M each in FY07 and FY08 is also being pursued.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 18 months, and have a total value in the range of $400,000 to $1,000,000.  The total value of all efforts awarded under this BAA will not exceed $10 million.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts only.

Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability of the offeror to achieve the objectives of the BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.     Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  ARDA and the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

The Government may use the services of Booz Allen Hamilton, Omen, Inc., Teknowledge, Mitretek Systems, RAND, and Institute for Defense Analysis personnel in an advisory role for the technical evaluation of proposals.  The exclusive responsibility for evaluation remains with the Government.  Representatives of the foregoing firm(s) participating in the evaluation process will sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation process and to protect any proprietary information within the proposals.  Any objection to the use of any or all the personnel identified above must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

<DESC>***The purpose of this modification is to extend the response time to Friday, April 7th, 4:30 pm CST.  This extension is due to a slight change to the specifications.  The updated specifications are attached.  The machine must meet or exceed all specifications.***




1.     The 12th Contracting Squadron, Randolph AFB TX, has a requirement for one (1) machining center for nonferrous metals/woods/plastics in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW) and specifications.   The machine must meet or exceed those specifications that are listed     This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ) number F3P3BD6031A100.     This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  For small business set-asides other than construction or services, any concern proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must furnish the product of a small business manufacturer.     The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.     Award is contingent upon availability of funds. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 333512; size standard 500 employees.

2.     The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.     Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1.     Oral quotes will not be accepted.     Your quote should include your Cage Code, DUNS, and Tax Identification numbers.     To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ, contractors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, no exceptions.     To register, please visit http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.     Contractors must complete the Representations and Certifications in the ORCA database at http://www.bpn.gov/orca.       

3.     FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     Addendum:     Basis for Award:     This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures.     For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.     Offers shall propose on all items.     Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.     An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.     Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 

4.     The evaluation process will proceed as follows:     (a) Technical Acceptance:     By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, statement of work, and all other requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract, and will be determined technically acceptable.     Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:     Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price.     Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.     Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished    c) Past Performance:   Using questionnaires, the contracting officer will seek relevant and recent performance information on all technically acceptable offers based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Recency:     To be considered recent, a contract shall have been performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this posting.     Relevancy:     Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude.     The following varying degrees of relevancy apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant	Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.  Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 5 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers.     The offeror shall provide the attached past performance questionnaire to the reference and bear responsibility for ensuring that the reference provides the completed questionnaire to the point of contact identified in paragraph 11 of this posting by the deadline for offer submission.     Questionnaires submitted prior to the deadline for offer submission will be accepted.     The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager.
 
5.     The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     The agency will evaluate past performance in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs 4(c) through 8 of this solicitation.     The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.     The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     A trade-off process is then conducted.     The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.     A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror is received.     In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.     

6.     Overall confidence ratings are defined as follows: High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable. Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

7.     Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.     Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive a neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.     However, a rating other than neutral may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts, or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts.     When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).     Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.     The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.     The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond. 

8.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, and is judged to have an overall high performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.     Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated high confidence in the performance assessment, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated high confidence overall for past performance.     An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.     If no proposals are rated high confidence in the performance assessments, an integrated analysis will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.

9.     The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of very good or lower.  If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.     The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.       

10.     The following clauses and provisions are applicable to this solicitation:     FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, FAR 52.219-1 Alt 1, Small Business Program Representations, FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, Addendum: Para (c) Changes is tailored as follows:     The contracting officer may modify the contract unilaterally under the following circumstances:     (a) to make administrative changes that do not affect the price or substantive terms; (b) to issue change orders or directions; or (c) to make changes authorized by clauses other than a changes clause, including but not limited to the Property clause, or Suspension of Work Clause.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award an IDIQ, commercial type contract on a non-competitive, sole-source basis to Trek Diagnostic Systems for the delivery of Sensititre equipment and lab supplies for the period of one Base Year and four Option Years. This is a follow-on to Contract No. 223-03-7501 with Trek Diagnostics. The FDA intends to purchase the following MIC plates, lab supplies, and equipment during the Base Year:  Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Plates for E. coli and Salmonella, 10 per box, 1,600 boxes; MIC Plates for Enterococcus, 10 per box, 500 boxes; MIC Plates for Campylobacter, 10 per box, 425 boxes; Custom MIC plates for research, 10 per box, 100 boxes;  MIC single antibiotic test strips for research, 8 per box,  400 boxes; Mueller Hinton broth with TES, 11 ml tubes, 100 per box, 220 boxes; demineralized water, 6 mL tubes, 100 per box, 220 boxes; Doseheads for use with Autoinoculator, 100 per box, 263 boxes;  Mueller Hinton broth with TES, 5 ml tubes, 100 per box, 43 boxes; Mueller Hinton Broth with TES and lysed horse blood, 11 mL tubes, 10 per box, 425 boxes; 0.5 polymer McFarland standard, 14 each; autoinoculator, one each; Sensitouch Reader, one each; ARIS System, one each; and Computer System with  Sensititre Windows software, one each.

The National Antimicrobial resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is an interagency surveillance program involving FDA, CDC, and USDA.  Sensititre equipment was installed in all NARMS laboratories at the inception of the program in 1996 to assure methodological consistency.  Sensititre specializes in antimicrobial susceptibility testing of veterinary drugs but also supplies products for determination of MICs for drugs that are used to treat human infections.  The use of a single test system in all NARMS laboratories ensures consistent testing of isolates and enhances comparability of the resulting data.  Varying test systems could impart bias into the susceptibility results and thereby preclude trends analysis of MIC data, an integral part of the NARMS program.  This would severely limit the Government’s ability to detect and respond to emerging resistance problems and outbreaks of resistant zoonotic enteric disease.  For these reasons, the Sensititre system currently established in NARMS laboratories must continue to be used.  The disposable supplies will be used by the Government with its Sensititre equipment which requires ancillary supplies specific to the equipment.  Sensititre products are solely distributed in the US by Trek Diagnostic Systems of Cleveland, Ohio.  The Sensititre AST (Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test) system is found in human and animal hospital and private diagnostic laboratories across the country and internationally because it provides consistent and reliable data and is simple and easy to use.  This is not a formal request for quotes.  However, the evaluation of other offers and any award decision will be made on a best value basis.  The FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.

<DESC>*******************SOLICITATION REOPENING NOTICE*****************

THE 100% TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE REQUIREMENT IS HEREBY DISSOLVED BECAUSE NO REASONABLE QUOTES WERE RECEIVED FROM RESPONSIBLE SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS THAT WERE COMPETITIVE IN TERMS OF MARKET PRICE, QUALITY AND DELIVERY.  

THEREFORE THIS ACQUISITION IS HEREBY REOPENED AS UNRETRICTED, WITH OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIVE PROCEDURES.


The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC) Maritime group seeks strong, responsive proposals from well-qualified sources to enter into a Firm Fixed price (FFP), Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).  The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one of more times at the discretion of the government.  The total shall not exceed 5 years.  This is a sole source solicitation for the supplies listed in Section B for both DLA stock locations and military customers around the world.  CONTRACT SCOPE:  The supplies covered by this contract are spare or replacement parts which are currently shown as being sole source items to Parker Hannifin, Cage 98441, Deutsch Stratoflex, Cage 14798 and Eaton Aeroquip, Cage 00624.  129 NSNs are included in this grouping (see listing of NSNs below).  Award will be made on an ALL OR NONE BASIS per NSN for the supplies covered under this contract.  It is currently projected that a mix of stock and Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) orders will be issued.  The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.  Specifications, plans or drawings are NOT AVAILABLE.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside acquisition.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the government does not possess complete, unrestrictive, technical data, therefore the government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) 1.  Approved sources are Parker Hannifin, Deutsch Stratoflex and Eaton Aeroquip.  While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.  The initial 232 sole source NSNs are listed below.  Additional NSNs sole source to Parker Hannifin, Deutsch Stratoflex and Eaton Aeroquip may be added to any resultant contract at a later date using the Add / Delete Clause H15D01 and are subject to synopsis in the CBD.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION: The solicitation will be open for a period of 60 days after its publication at FedBizOpps. To be considered for the full proposals must be submitted on or before 1:00 p.m. local time on the date of closure. In addition to hard copies, an electronic copy of each Offerors spreadsheet must be submitted on floppy diskette(s) or compact disk(s), according to instructions in the SOO. Proposals submitted by fax or e-mail are NOT acceptable and will NOT be considered. DSCC will neither acknowledge receipt of nor return submissions. PROPOSAL FORMAT: Detailed instructions for completing the proposals are contained in the SOW. Proposals not conforming to the specified format will not be reviewed or evaluated.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received. The Government also reserves the right to fund all, or any part of, a proposal evaluated to be eligible for award. All responsible sources may submit an offer / quote, which shall be considered.

<DESC>COMNAVAIRSYSCOM, Patuxent River, MD is seeking information from potential sources regarding industry technologies applicable improving/advancing the current Navy 40 degree Field of View (FOV) Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) Night Vision Cueing Display (NVCD) program to the Operational Test (OT)-ready state.  

CURRENT TECHNOLOGY: The Navy is currently flying the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) on the F/A-18E/F aircraft.  The JHMCS system is a day-only system having no capability to combine night vision imagery with the JHMCS symbology and weapons cueing.  The Navy JHMCS Night Vision Cueing and Display (NVCD) program incorporates a Night Vision Device (NVD) capable of integrating with the JHMCS system.  The JHMCS NVCD includes an embedded flat panel display within the NVD allowing night vision cueing and display of JHMCS symbology.   

The Navy is seeking information from vendors who are capable of manufacturing the 40-degree field of view JHMCS NVCD within the following Key Performance Parameters (KPP):
1.	System Accuracy: Night JHMCS accuracy enabling both AIM-9X cueing and the ability to slew the targeting FLIR in the narrow field-of-view mode with the target in the FLIR window. The minimum JHMCS NVCD accuracy when looking directly forward through a 20 degree cone shall be 6 milliradians.
2.	Ejection Safety:  Head mounted hardware does not lead to neck injury during ejection sequence. 
3.	Display Quality:  JHMCS NVCD display equal to or better in quality than the day JHMCS display. 
4.	Night vision resolution:  Equal or better than AN/AVS-9.
             5.    Dual Seat Capable:  Capable of working in both the front and aft F/A-18F cockpits           
                     with JHMCS dual seat installed.
: 
Vendor Information should include the following regarding available product:
	
a.	Identify previous testing on the device 
b.	Identify previous testing on a similar device 
c.	Completed engineering analysis 

Schedule: The 40-degree JHMCS NVCD program must be at an OT-ready state by August 2007 

The Navy  will review the maturity of the vendor’s designs for a 40-degree FOV JHMCS NVCD program, and will review the ability of the vendors to meet the schedule outlined above.	

This request is for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. Companies responding to this request should provide detailed information on their capabilities and experience to Contract Specialist, Code 2.4.2.5.1, Bldg 2272, Suite 347, COMNAVAIRSYSCOMHQ, 47123 Buse Road, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. The Office for Grants and Training (G&T) is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy assessment of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) approved air-purifying escape respirators. The Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) is inviting manufacturers to provide information. This information will be used in the market research conducted regarding air-purifying escape respirators and will provide support information for CDP assessment participants. 

The intent of the user assessment program will be to provide the emergency response community feedback and evaluation of equipment based on utilization of each piece of equipment selected in scenarios that replicate, to the maximum extent possible, conditions that will be experienced in incident response. The results of the assessment will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) endorse any product or manufacturer.

The types of air-purifying escape respirator equipment being researched are ones that would be used by emergency responders and the general public to quickly remove themselves from a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) contaminated area.

The assessment will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from the emergency response population, representative of all disciplines of agencies and jurisdictions across the US. These evaluators will be actual users of the equipment in the field. The evaluators will be presented with specific scenarios and tasks to be carried out using the equipment both as a responder wearing Class 3 personal protective equipment (PPE) and as a civilian. The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluated criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator. Some of the criteria could include capability, usability, affordability, deployability, and maintainability.

If you wish to provide information about your particular brand/product for this user evaluation program, please provide in electronic (MS Word) format, your company name, address, point of contact, telephone, fax and email address. Additionally, please provide any information available such as the testing status of equipment against the NIOSH Standard for CBRN air-purifying escape respirators, adaptability of equipment to be used in hazardous environments while wearing Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) recommended PPE, reliability, maintainability, durability, environmental limits, safety reports, latest research and new developments.

Do not send your piece of equipment. Selected equipment will be purchased from distributors/suppliers as the equipment is selected for the assessment.

Respond by 4:00 PM CST on April 14, 2006, by e-mail to Phillis Reid at phillis.reid@dhs.gov or Ella Chapman at ella.chapman@dhs.gov; or fax to (256) 847-2323 or by mail to Phillis Reid, Contract Specialist, Center for Domestic Preparedness, P. O. Box 5100, Anniston, AL 36205

DESCRIPTION:

The smalltooth sawfish was listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 2003.  They were once common in the Gulf of Mexico and east coast of the United States.  Decades of fishing pressure, both commercial and recreational, and habitat loss caused the population to decline significantly during the second half of the twentieth century.  Today smalltooth sawfish exist mostly in southern Florida.

Research and monitoring priorities have been identified in the Draft Smalltooth Sawfish Recovery Plan.  One of the priority tasks identified in the plan was the monitoring of the number of sawfish in nursery regions throughout Florida.  The most important nursery region for small tooth sawfish is the section of coast from Marco Island (Naples) to Florida Bay.  This is also a region outside of the fishery independent monitoring program run by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) and encompassing the coast of the Everglades National Park.

This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for an Electronic Cylinder Lifting Control System.  Specifications for RFQ – NNM06151529Q A vertically oriented cylindrical vacuum chamber with a removable bottom dome used for loading and holding test articles requires a new dome lifting control system. This dome lifting control system Shall consist of four (4) ninety inch (90”) stroke vacuum compatible electric cylinders with controls for motion on each cylinder along with a master control unit. These cylinders shall have a clevis type upper and lower mount that will fit a one inch (1”) diameter pinned joint with a double ear at the bottom and a single ear at the top. The extended length shall equal two hundred nineteen and one-half inches (219.5”). The compressed length is to be one hundred twenty seven and one-half inches (127.5”). The load capacity Shall be seven thousand five hundred pounds (7500 lbs). The electric cylinder shafts shall be lubricated with NASA/MSFC approved vacuum compatible grease. The 4 electric cylinders are to be driven by 4 servo motors, one independent servo motor for each electric cylinder, thus creating four matched sets of servo motor and electric cylinder. Each matched set of servo motor and electric cylinder shall: 1) be equipped with brakes to serve two functions. The first function is to prevent any motion of the electric cylinder in the event of a power failure to this control system. The second function will be to aid in precision stopping to eliminate any slew motion, continued inertial motion, or any hysteresis type of motion. 2) have independent motion sensing and control, and be controlled with enough power and precision that the resolution of vertical motion of the chamber dome is accurate within one-eighth of an inch (1/8”). 3) have independent limit controls to prevent overdriving in either the full closed or full open position. 4) be operated in unison to maintain the chamber dome in a horizontally level attitude at all times in all positions throughout the full range of motion between and at the full closed and full open positions. As a minimum capability the master controller for these four matched sets of servo motor and electric cylinder shall provide the following functions. 1) An automatic function to re-adjust, re-align, re-synchronize the four matched sets of servo motors and electric cylinders if the chamber dome level attitude is ever violated. This automatic function is to be executed upon command by an operator. 2) A variable speed select function for chamber dome motion is required. The minimum selectable speed is to be one inch per minute (1”/min). The maximum selectable speed is to be thirty-six inches per minute (36”/min). The increment of variable speed selection is to be one-half inch per minute (1/2”/min). 3) A full range automatic open and close function is required to be executed upon command by an operator. 4) A selectable distance of motion in either the open or close direction function is required to be executed automatically upon command by an operator. The maximum distance selectable shall be the full range of available motion in the specified direction. The minimum increment of distance selectable shall be one-half inch (1/2”). 5) A manual control of motion by an operator in either the open or closed direction is required. The manual motion control for the operator shall be provided by a jog control joy stick. Other general control system specifications are as follows: 1) The building power available of use is 208 VAC 3 phase 4 wire where single phase to neutral is 120 VAC. Amperage limit of 60 amps is deemed more than sufficient. 2) The master controller shall provide operator interface through an HMI interface with a minimum size of 5” touch screen.  3) All control components required to implement this control system separate from the 4 matched sets of servo motor and electric cylinder are to be housed in a single cabinet. 4) All interconnecting cabling between the master controller and the 4 matched sets of servo motor and electric cylinders is required and shall provided. It is assumed that fifty foot (50’) cable lengths will be sufficient. Vendor must verify this to ensure no cables are to short. 5) Power cabling for the system is required and is to be provided by the vendor. It is assumed that fifty foot (50’) cable lengths will be sufficient. Vendor must verify this to ensure no cables are to short.

*****STATEMENT OF WORK:  SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT SERVICES*****

BACKGROUND:

The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires, among other things, that all FMPs include a fishery impact statement intended to assess, specify, and describe the likely effects of the measures on fishermen and fishing communities.  The National Environmental Policy Act also requires Federal agencies to consider the interactions of natural and human environments by using a “systematic, interdisciplinary approach which will ensure the integrated use of the natural and social sciences...in planning and decision-making.” Moreover, agencies need to address the aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health effects, which may be direct, indirect, or cumulative. Consideration of social impacts is a growing concern as fisheries experience increased participation and/or declines in stocks. The consequences of management actions need to be examined to better ascertain and, if necessary and possible, mitigate regulatory impacts on affected constituents.

NOAA/NMFS (2001) guidelines for social impact assessments specify that the following elements are utilized in the development of FMPs and amendments:

1. The size and demographic characteristics of the fishery-related work force residing in the area; these determine demographic, income, and employment effects in relation to the work force as a whole, by community and region.
2. The cultural issues of attitudes, beliefs, and values of fishermen, fishery-related workers, other stakeholders, and their communities.
3. The effects of proposed actions on social structure and organization; that is, on the ability to provide necessary social support and services to families and communities.
4. The non-economic social aspects of the proposed action or policy; these include lifestyle issues, health and safety issues, and the non-consumptive and recreational use of living marine resources and their habitats.
5. The historical dependence on and participation in the fishery by fishermen and communities, reflected in the structure of fishing practices, income distribution and rights.

OBJECTIVES:

The Highly Migratory Species Management Division (F/SF1) is in the process of amending and consolidating its FMPs.  F/SF1 needs current profiles for communities dependent upon the highly migratory species (HMS) fisheries.

SCOPE OF WORK:

PART I:
A.	Review existing HMS community profile materials and identify gaps in existing profiles; identify which communities are dependent upon the HMS fisheries and should be profiled 
B.	Review other NMFS Social Impact Assessments (SIAs) and identify previously developed community profiles that overlap with HMS fisheries 
C.	Conduct a general literature review of SIAs and analyses that may pertain to HMS communities 

PART II:
Create profiles of HMS communities as needed based on the NOAA/NMFS (2001) guidelines for social impact assessments.

DELIVERABLES:

PART I:
A.	A list of HMS communities that need to be profiled and an explanation of the criteria used to select those communities.
B.	A list with sources of available community profiles
C.	A report on recent research regarding HMS communities in sociological and anthropological fields

PART II:
HMS Community Profile Report as identified in Part I and as deemed necessary by SF1.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The effort is estimated to be full time for one year.
