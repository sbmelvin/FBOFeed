<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR 32) seeks white papers describing innovative technology concepts that will form the foundation for future (circa 2015) naval systems for clandestine undersea surveillance to provide the location of submarines in far- forward and/or contested waters.   Concepts should emphasize mobile and/or fixed, multiple mode sensing nodes, networked to provide an adaptive and/or relocatable sensing grid.   Concepts should include technologies and approaches which will result in low false alarms, reduced manning, provide tracking with effective attack criteria for existing or emerging weapons, and be operable from ambiguous warning through neutralization of the threat.  Successful concepts will incorporate environmental information to optimize deployment and sensing.  Concepts should include technologies that are rapidly deployable (within days) and remain survivable to countermeasures for their operational life.   It is anticipated that this period will extend from four to six months.   These novel concepts must support the future naval undersea warfare directions of Sea Power 21 and Naval Power 21 and should be operable and effective from near the enemy shore to the vicinity of the Sea Base or Strike Group, including shallow and deep water.   

ONR highly encourages teaming of academia, industry, and government laboratories with a view toward speeding the transition of new science and technology into fielded systems.  Priority will be given for concept development proposals addressing a complete undersea surveillance system.    Priority will be given to concepts of sufficient maturity such that significant aspects can be demonstrable during fiscal years 2006 and 2007. 

The technological concepts sought in this offering may lead to further development of a prototype surveillance system demonstrable during FY08-10 using higher category funds.   

To assist prospective offerors regarding the missions of interest and to promote more responsive white papers, the ONR will conduct a one-day “Offerors Day” on 21 May 2004.  This will provide a forum for potential offerors to obtain information regarding mission operating environments and constraints and obtain a better understanding of the desired advanced capabilities.  Potential offerors who wish to attend this briefing must respond with a notice of intent using the form provided on the web site (http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/baa/04_018) no later than three weeks after the date of publication of this BAA, so that adequate meeting facilities can be determined.     

White papers are initially sought to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of the offeror in preparing full technical and cost proposals without an initial assessment of the operational, technical and logistical feasibility of the concept.   Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their white paper submission.  However, any such invitation does not assure a subsequent award.  Any offeror may submit a full proposal even if its white paper was not identified as promising or if no white paper is submitted.  It is anticipated that funding decisions will be completed by 15 September 2004.  Finalizing of contract or assistance agreement terms with selected offerors will follow. 

Approximately $40,000,000.00 of Applied Research (Budget Category 6.2) funds are anticipated to be available over a three year period beginning October 2004 to conduct these research and development efforts.

<DESC>MIXING UTILITY, LIQUID VISCOMETRIC APPARATUS


Description:
Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has developed a rheometer technology that allows for the application of uniform shear in the generation of foam emulsions operable for loads in the range of 0-1000 lbf.  The resulting data obtained from this device and the methodology employed with the device can then be directly translated to determine the evolution of the sample viscosity as a function of the process variables and formulation.  In addition, the device can be operated to determine the shear viscosity of fluids without the loss of sample or exposure to air.

LANL is seeking a licensee or a joint-development partner to further develop this technology.

Advantages:
•	This device is readily mounted to conventional mechanical testing frames for operational use
•	LANL device accommodates syringes of sample material from 10cc to 50cc and can be modified to accommodate even larger syringes 
•	The syringe assembly (sample container) of the LANL device may be removed and replaced from the rheometer rapidly
•	No cleaning of the LANL device is required with replacement of a syringe assembly

Status:
A U.S. patent application has been filed on this technology.  Foreign patent rights may be available.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.   A SOLICITATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic Division is conducting market research to identify interested sources for information and planning purposes only qualified and experienced sources for baseline marine species research and monitoring of a proposed East Coast Shallow Water Training Range (ECSWTR).  All qualified and experienced contractors; non-profit organizations, academic institutions, state and federal agencies are encouraged to respond.  The ECSWTR is a proposed instrumented anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training range.  The Navy’s preferred site for the range is in the Cherry Point Operating Area (OPAREA), located in Onslow Bay, southeast of New River North Carolina, and approximately 105-km (57-NM) from the North Carolina shoreline.  The range is proposed to encompass approximately 1,713-square kilometers (500-square nautical miles).  Proposed ASW training on this range will involve surface vessels and submarines, aircraft, sonar, exercise torpedoes (non-explosive) and submarine target simulators.  The environmental impacts are currently being evaluated in an Environmental Impact Statement/Overseas Environmental Impact Statement that should be available as a draft later this year.  Baseline data sought includes species distribution, abundance, density estimates, and seasonal movement patterns specific to Onslow Bay and the proposed ECSWTR.  Regular monitoring to assess trends in species composition, distribution, and abundance would follow the baseline study.  Results would be reported in a manner that would fulfill the Navy’s monitoring and reporting requirement of a Letter of Authorization (LOA) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).  All methods of survey and monitoring will be considered; however, it is anticipated that aerial and/or shipboard surveys may form the foundation of the baseline study and monitoring program.  All data must be collected in a scientifically rigorous manner with methods and results subject to peer review.  The contractor must provide or contract all equipment and personnel needed for the proposed study, monitoring and reporting of results.  The area proposed for monitoring will be an operational Navy training range, therefore, any on-site survey work must be scheduled in advance and clearance arranged via the Navy scheduling authority.  This announcement is open until 12:00 Eastern Standard Time, 28 May 2004.  The Government reserves the right to make this requirement a set-aside.  If a contract is awarded for this effort, the Government anticipates and Firm Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity contract using FAR Part 12 for a duration of five (5) years (1 basic plus 4 option years).  However, contract type and duration could change.  Proposed submissions of interest and/or statements of capability in the area mentioned above should include the following information, taking into consideration that the information submitted may not be used for a procurement action: (1) Reference to solicitation number N62470-04-R-0672; (2) Company Name and Address; (3) Point of contact name, telephone, and email address; (4) If a United States or Foreign company; (5) Company Size, NAICS Code 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees (6) If your company is a Small Business, specify if your company is or is not one of the following: a. Small Disadvantaged Business, b. HubZone Business, c. Women-Owned Business, d. 8a Business; (7) An outline of previous projects, or specific work previously performed or being performed that is similar to this particular; (8) Capability to perform the required tasks with a general approach to baseline research and monitoring (9) Any other specific or pertinent technical information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.

Department of Commerce, (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill AFB, Florida, intends to test cell check run and preserve two (2) Rolls Royce T56-A-14 engines on continuous 90 day cycles. Because of the extended times in between engine changes on the (2) WP-3D aircraft owned by the NOAA/AOC, the NOAA/AOC intends to put its (2) spare Rolls Royce T56-A-14 engines on a continuous 90 day test cell check run and preservation cycle in order to insure Ready For Installation (RFI) engines with a minimum of turn around time. Delays in engine installation and return to service can be caused by the sometime excessive down time of these engines. The contractor shall provide special equipment, tools, and labor to test run, make minor adjustments, and preserve the Rolls Royce T56-A-14 engine. One spare engine will be rotated through the contractor facility every 90 days requiring a total of (8) check run and preservation cycles over a (1)year period for the (2) engines (4 runs per year each engine). The NOAA/AOC will ship the engine to the contractor’s facility for the check run and preservation. Return transportation of the engine will also be contracted by the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center. The contractor shall be a FAA certified repair station and manufacturer certified for the engine type. Contractor shall have a type certified and calibrated test cell used exclusively for the T56- series engine installed in P-3 Quick Engine Change kit without major mounting modification to the test cell. The contract will be for a period of (1) year. Due to the nature of the NOAA/AOC operating requirements, a turn around time period of not more than 5 working days is required from the date of receipt of the engine at the contractor facility. The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the performance of this contract, a minimum of $1,500,000.00 of insurance. The NAICS Code is 336412.  This service is being acquired under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This is not a small business set aside. A copy of the  RFQ will be available on or about May 10, 2004.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for solicitation number NOI4064.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 325414, which has a size standard of 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure on a sole source basis from Hyclone Laboratories Inc., the only known source to provide this Lot #ANM20277 for 300ml bottles of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS); 12 months storage/4 shipments.  The laboratory has used FBS from Hyclone for over 15 years and  have found their FBS to be consistently of a very high standard that is absolutely required in order to maintain and propagate the large number of different cell lines and primary cell cultures with diverse biological specificities that are used in by over 40 investigators in the laboratory.  One of the primary research efforts in our laboratory is the development of a vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).  We have developed an animal model system that utilizes viral infected rhesus macaques to assess the protective efficacy of potential candidate HIV-1 vaccines.  The ability to culture primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in vivo differentiated macrophages isolated directly from rhesus macaques is critical to this effort.  Culture of the primary cells is essential in order to evaluate the immunological responses in the animals to different vaccine regimens.  Prescreening of specific FBS lots is required in order to insure that the FBS selected will allow for the growth of the primary cells as well as propagation of the virus in these cells.  The screening process is very time consuming and requires specialized techniques to successfully isolate and properly culture these specific primary cell types from the animals.  The in vivo differentiated macrophage cultures are particularly sensitive to having the proper reagents and culture conditions.  The specific Lot #ANM20277 Fetal Bovine Serum from Hyclone indicated above has be screened in this regard and has been found to meet the criteria required to be used in our ongoing vaccine studies.  As the vaccine studies can take over three years to complete, are quite expensive to conduct and are currently ongoing, continuity in the quality of this essential tissue culture reagent is paramount to the successful continuance of our vaccine research.  Anticipated Date of delivery – May 10, 2004; place of delivery- NIH/NIAID, Maryland 20892; FOB origin.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 5133                  April 24, 2003 	Request for Quotations 	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII Office, is soliciting quotations from companies that may have the qualifications to complete the tasks listed in accordance with the Scope of Work listed  below: 	Scope of Work Cell Phone Airtime and Accessories I.	Background The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region VIII (USEPA) relies on cell phones to keep in touch with various stakeholders when personnel are on travel or during hours when they are not working in the office.  Due to the  varied nature of the work conducted by USEPA and the distribution of existing cell phones numbers with our stakeholders, the contract mechanism shall be flexible enough to allow USEPA to transfer existing numbers to a new plan as well as adjust quickly to extraneous events outside of the  Government's control. II.	Objective The objective of this contract is to procure a cell phone service that pools existing national cell phone plans into one comprehensive plan where appropriate in order to save the Government money; increase the number of phone numbers available in the contract;  as well as provide the highest level of telecommunication needs to USEPA personnel in the field.   The Agency anticipates a need of 80 cell phones, airtime and accessories for 1 year with options to extend for another 3 years. III.	Telecommunication Needs The Region anticipates a need of  approximately 69 cell phones on a shared minutes plan as follows: 40 phones require shared minutes plan with approximately 300 to 400 minutes/month 10 phones require shared minutes plan with approximately 500 minutes/month 13 phones require shared minutes plan with approximately 700 to 1000  minutes/month 3 phones require shared minutes plan with approximately 1000 to 1200 minutes/month 3 phones require shared minutes plan with approximately 2000 minutes/month The region also anticipates a need of approximately 11 cell phones on a 700 to 1000 minutes/month shared minutes plans using  push to talk technology. Besides the monthly costs of the plan, each offer shall break out in its pricing data any additional charges for services such as text messaging, shared minutes, in network calling, monthly charges to avoid roaming charges, regulatory fees, activation fees, a home office  link (if available), etc.  Because USEPA is a Government agency, no taxes should be factored in the submission.   In addition to pricing data, please provide at least 3 of the most relevant and related references for similar work in terms of size and scope over the past 3 years.  Provide the  following information: ?	The name and address of the organization for the organization for which services were provided; ?	The current telephone number of a responsible technical representative of the organization and the current business contact; ?	The type of contract performed; and ?	A brief  description of the services provided, including the length of performance and the total dollar amount Provide at least 1 point of contact in the service department who will manage USEPA's account so that they may be contacted to discuss service needs.  This contract will have various lines of  accounting and it is USEPA's best estimate of cell phone needs in the immediate future; therefore, the Agency expects to work with the service department up front upon award of the contract to provide a monthly billing cycle that breaks out costs by lines of accounting.  It is also the Agency's  intent that the service department will continue to work with USEPA on a monthly basis for the first 6 months of the contract after contract is awarded to determine areas where USEPA may upgrade existing technology or save money as well as move individuals who continually use more minutes than  allocated to a higher rate plan.	 The following existing cell phone numbers will need to be moved from the Agency's current plan to a new  one: 303-808-0576		303-808-2045		303-808-3831		303-808-9056 303-808-3919		303-808-9778		720-320-6252		303-589-1874 303-589-1984		720-320-6251		720-320-6253		303-808-1738 303-884-0437		303-884-1236		303-884-1533		303-886-1630 303-898-5132		303-601-2656		720-273-9909		303-249-4058 303-249-4085		303-3 24-7904		303-886-1631		303-886-1632 303-886-1633		303-886-1634		303-886-1635		303-886-1636 303-886-1637		303-886-1638		303-886-1639		303-886-1640 303-886-1641		303-886-1642		303-886-1643		303-884-0594 303-884-0293		303-638-8125		720-530-3687		720-480-2778 720-272-9507		720-480-2776		720-480-2766		30 3-898-8465 303-320-6254		303-898-9097		720-480-2793		720-480-2792 720-480-2768		 USEPA will also be purchasing new cell phones and accessories.

<DESC>The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Antimicrobial Resistance Research Unit (ARRU), Richard B. Russell Agricultural Research Center, Athens, GA, requires technical services to coordinate the work of personnel assigned to the USDA project, Collaboration in Animal Health and Food Safety (CAHFSE), as well as timely summarization and dissemination of the results.  The CAHFSE project is conducted through a collaboration between ARS, FSIS, and APHIS and coordination between agencies is also needed.  These technical services are required so that the ARRU can meet the Current Research Information System (CRIS) objectives to enhance the overall understanding of bacteria that pose a food-safety risk by monitoring these bacteria on-farm and in-plant over time.  This routine monitoring will provide a means to identify, track, and ultimately mitigate critical diseases, as well as the development of antimicrobial resistance within zoonotic and commensal bacteria, in food-animal production prior to dissemination throughout the food chain which may impact human health.  These technical services must be completed in accordance with the CAHFSE project scheduled time frame of quarterly collection of biological samples and herd health/management data from sentinel farms and slaughter facilities throughout the US.  Duties will include the following: (1) Manage the phenotypic and geneotypic analysis of isolates obtained from CAHFSE.  This work will be conducted at the ARRU site.  (2) Expedite timely posting of summarized results including the prevalence and serotype of cultured microbes, antimicrobial resistance patters, and molecular characteristics of the isolates.  Maintain all data in a central database.  (3) Ensure that data are transmitted in a timely manner to collaborators at APHIS and FSIS and posted on a public website.  Assist in construction and maintenance of the website.  (4) Coordinate, guide, and facilitate planning activities of this multi-agency project involving APHIS, FSIS, and ARS. (5) Solicit and encourage commodity groups, consumer groups and environmental groups to participate in the planning process and in securing participation of livestock producers, packing and processing plants, and commercial retail outlets.  (6) Coordinate and facilitate design of associated research projects which will lead to timely development of intervention strategies.  (7) Guide data analysis and publication of results in refereed scientific journal in partnership with APHIS and FSIS.  (8) Assist in the preparation of the Office of Scientific Quality Review (OSQR) CRIS project which is scheduled to be written in the Fall of 2004.  (9) Present results at scientific meetings.  For this acquisition, ARS intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with L&R Research Associates of Watkinsville, Georgia.  ARRU has determined that the key personnel of this firm have unique qualifications that justify the absence of full and open competition, as authorized by 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1.  These qualifications include experience in conducting and supervising research; experience in planning and oversight of large-scale, multi-disciplinary research and development projects; in-depth knowledge of animal agriculture and interactions with swine industry leaders; demonstrated ability and experience in building collaborations among personnel from different institutions; and knowledge of the organizational structure of ARS, APHIS, and FSIS as it relates to CAHFSE.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all responses received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis.  Therefore, interested persons may identify their capability and respond to the requirement no later than 2:00 p.m. EST on May 10, 2004, to Pat Jones, fax number (706) 546-3444.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NOTE:  THIS POSTING IS A MODIFICATION OF A CURRENT NOTICE AND   

SERVES AS NOTICE THAT THE REFERENCE NUMBER RFP HAS BEEN AMENDED TO CHANGE THE NAICS CODE AND REMOVE THE CASCADING METHOD OF PREFERENCE FROM THE RFP.  


The Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to award a contract to provide technical information support resources for cancer preventive agent identification, development, and qualification for clinical trials.  The projects required to satisfy the RFP workscope shall provide the diverse and specialized technical support services and products needed for the preclinical and clinical development of the most promising cancer chemopreventive agents.  The contractor will be responsible for providing services that support the discovery and early development of new agents in chemoprevention through literature searching, class studies, and agent scoring. The preclinical and clinical drug testing is supported through a comprehensive system of documenting all test results and clinical activities related to the agent and agent combination through a computerized database.  The workscope of the RFP is divided into different task areas.  The task areas of the statement of work include:1) Cancer Preventive Agent Identification and Documentation; 2) Cancer Preventive Agent Data and Report Analysis, Status  and Documentation; 3) Information Management System; and 4) General Tasks.  These task areas are fully integrated and cohesive.  Offerors are required to respond to all task areas of the RFP as one package.  Comprehensive details of the information management system are expected to be provided by the offeror based on their knowledge of the disciplines required in the Statement of Work, as well as experience working in the multidisciplinary fields of chemoprevention.  However, the information management system must be compatible with and migrate to the existing DCP Enterprise System Knowledge base (DESK) requirements specified in the RFP. The proposed acquisition is a re-competition of contract N02-CN-05008 awarded to CCS Associates, Inc.   It is anticipated that one (1) level of effort, TERM type contract will be awarded and that the period of performance will consist of a base period of five (5) years plus two (2) option years for possible total of seven (7) contract years.  It is also anticipated that there will be options for additional hours for each contract year including option years six and seven.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N02-CN-45005-46 is only available electronically and may be accessed through the National Cancer Institute’s Research Contract Branch (RCB) home page via the Internet address:  http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/:   On the Home Page SELECT Current Requests for Proposals.

Cummins has the  required detailed knowledge of the operation of diesel engines, including the engine air emissions profile and engine electronic controls.  The authority for this sole source procurement is cited in FAR 6.302-1, in that Cummins is the only known source with the knowledge required to provide these services.  Vendor/s who wish to challenge this sole-source procurement must give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 14 days from the publication date of this synopsis.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Government intends to award on a sole source basis to Virtual Media Integration LTD. for the purchase of a Soft/Flexible X-Ray Cassette System (SFXCS).  This system will be used for the additional recording of the performance of experimental large caliber munitions, EFP warheads, weapons and their components.  This will provide improved engineering support for the  development of Shape Charge Liners, EFP's (Explosively Formed Penetrates) and various other Warhead Firing Configurations in the Davidson Advance Warhead  Test Facility (DAWTF), building 660.  This Soft Flexible X-Ray Cassette System will enhance our equipment and current capabilities and will provide for a  state-of-the-art digital "early time" recording of EFP liner formation.  The Davidson Advanced Warhead Development Facility is an integral part of the  warhead development lifecycle; being able to  provide this additional data information to the designers will help ARDEC maintain its position as the  leader in warhead design, and prototype development.  The system shall include 6 ea. Imaging soft flexible recording media, SCSI card with cable for  Integration with existing NT 4.0 workstation and image reader / erasure system.  This systems hardware and software capabilities will be integrated so that the image data will be completely compatible with Davidon Advance  Warheads Test Facility existing VMI CR800 Digital X-ray System.  This will  allow for one software solution as well as one database seamlessly.  The  integration with existing hardware and software will also eliminate waste, save time and save money.

<DESC>Description

The purpose of this Modification #02 is to add the requirement for the origin (country of manufacture) of the products and to post questions and answers related to this procurement. The Authorized Geographic Codes for this contract are 000 (United States) and 110 (New Independent States - independent countries of the former Soviet Union). If a 000 or 110-origin product is not available, the offeror must provide an explanation and request a waiver in accordance with 22CFR 228.51; (this Federal Regulation may be found at the following link: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_01/22cfr228_01.html). There is no prescribed format or form for the waiver request. Question 1. The Thermal Cycler offered in our quotation seems to meet all of the specifications you list below.  It has gradient temperature capability, maximum gradient is 30°C over gradient range 20-70°C.  Accuracy is +-0.3°C as specified. Ramping rate is 3.0°C/second, which exceeds the specification.  Temp. range is 4° to 99°C as specified.  Are you confirming that our offer for this item meets your needs, or suggesting that we should change to a different model?  Answer: No changes are needed. Question 2. The unit we bid for the Thermal Block (FTC3102D) meet or exceed all the specifications listed below, with the exception of the programming. Our unit has space for 80 programs, you have requested space for 100 programs. Answer:  80 programs is OK. Question 3. Your specifications for the Thermal Block match closely to a discontinued model by Barnstead/Lab-Line, the PTB-214. From what I understand, Thermal Blocks technology was replaced with Thermal Cycler technology. If you have preferences toward particular units for the above two items, please let me know the model and I can bid against that. Otherwise I will let the quote stand for these two items. I have found a less expensive PCR Bench Top Hood - No Laminar Flow.  The 115V version of this unit can be seen on website, searching with catalog number. This is ordered as 220V at no additional charge. Answer:  OK. Question 4. PCR Bench Top Hood: 1st hood bid requirement states "no-ducting and laminar air flow". 2nd hood bid requirement states "no-ducting and           no-laminar air flow". Please,       clarify if these specifications should be the same - or, as stated, different? Any size limitations? Answer: They should be the same; 24in. x 24-28in. x 30-32in would be OK. Question 5. Vortex: What speed range? Should both an automatic and a manual touch control be included or just one type? Which type, if only one? Answer: 3,000 rpm with both an automatic and a manual touch control. Question 6. Clock: What size should the digital numbers be - 2.5cm, 5.0cm, etc? Answer: 5.0 cm. Question 7. Ice Cube, Maker: What type of ice -  flake, nugget, cubes, etc? Answer: Flake. How much ice should be made per hour? Answer: 3-5 liters per hour. Capacity of storage container? Answer: 30-50 liters. Should the unit be self-contained or modular style?  Answer: Unit can be self-contained or modular style. Question 8. Thermometer: What is the range and what graduation intervals? Answer: General purpose thermometer, 0-100°C, 1°C interval. Question 9. We have assumed that a Mini Gel-O-Submarine name mean the chamber for electrophoresis. But we do not know what horizontal or vertical gel unit it is necessary. Answer: Horizontal gel unit. Question 10. Can you specify what length of a wave is required for a fluorescent light for hoods? Answer: General purpose light for good workspace illumination, white light, plus UV 254 nm. [End of Modification]

5. MARKET VALUE: $ 87,439.00 - $ 113,674.00 per annum (GS 15 – equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: June   2004 –   June  2006
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

A. Basic Function of the position: 

The 1980s marked a watershed in recent Kosovo history.  During the 80s and early 90s, Serbia, the dominating “partner” in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, systematically began to exclude ethnic Albanians from positions of employment in the public and private sectors in the province of Kosovo as well as from access to services once available to them.  This systematic exclusionary policy, in Kosovo often referred to as apartheid, led to conflict between the Albanian population in Kosovo and the Serbian administrators and police.  The heavy-handed and eventually bloody attempts of the Serbs to put down the Albanian Kosovar rebellion ultimately led to the bombing campaign of NATO in 1999 that caused the withdrawal of Serbian authority and the establishment of UN administration (through UNMIK) over the province.

Support for the development of economic growth (EG) is a key element of accomplishing USAID’s strategic objectives in Kosovo.  USAID’s new five-year strategic plan for Kosovo includes two EG strategic objectives (SOs): SO 1.2, Improved policy and institutional climate for productive investment and SO 1.3, Accelerated private sector growth.    
USAID assistance in support of these SOs includes a contract with BearingPoint focused on the policy and institutional climate for productive investment (SO 1.2).  The areas supported by this contract are budget and tax, financial regulatory system (the Banking and Payments Authority of Kosovo), the commercial legal environment and privatization.  Support in each area includes institutional strengthening and public education.  The contract also provides support for increased integration into regional trade. Activities under SO 1.3, Accelerated growth of the private sector, are currently being developed and will focus on competitiveness and import substitution via increased competitiveness of the agricultural sector, improved capacity of private enterprises and an improved business operating environment.  The EG Office also supports SO4.1, Social stabilization achieved through special initiatives, through assistance to improve the commercial viability of the Kosovo Energy Company.  
In the area of local governance USAID plans to fund a new initiative to strengthen local governance, improve municipal leadership, increase transparency and accountability at the local level, and assist municipal governments to promote local economic development.  This initiative will be managed in the Democracy Governance Office, but will require input and technical advice from the EG Office.

ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS POSTED 3/23/04:  The project is a continuation of Phase I of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 80,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated cost range is $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.  Completion time is 196 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about July 19, 2004.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the bi-state Kansas City region consisting of the Kansas Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray; (2) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (3) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 15 and 16 and various return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 15 and 16 will be vacant.  Base Bid contract work includes tenant improvements consisting of new drywall partitions; minor amounts of ceiling replacement; new doors, frames and hardware; paint, plaster, and vinyl base; casework; tenant signage; redistribution of existing above ceiling HVAC; new, and relocation of, existing lighting fixtures; floor box connections for office furniture; new panel boards; and telephone and data raceway and drops.  Base Bid also includes shell work consisting of patching and preparing concrete floor slab for finishes, demolition and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts at the 15th and 16th floors, installation and finishing of new shaft walls at the 15th and 16th floors, and installation of new transformers.  Option Bid work includes minor modifications in rest rooms and vending rooms; installation of epoxy terrazzo and base, vinyl wall covering and carpet; and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage 1 will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage 2 will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications and price are approximately equal.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price most advantageous to the Government.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered - technical qualifications and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management Plan Approach.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  After all proposals have been ranked according to their technical quality, price proposals will be opened and separately ranked.  The two separate ranks will be averaged together into a single total rank and the offeror with the highest total rank will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, completed drawings and specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  The drawings are being provided as .DWF file.  Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.  Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact, 
2.	Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.	Your Company’s Tax ID Number, 
4.	Your Telephone Number, and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.  

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeds" and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official planholders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on Wednesday, April 14, 2004, at 9:00 a.m., local time, in room N133 of the Richard Bolling Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.  Proposals will be received in on Thursday, May 6, 2004, at 2:00 p.m, local time.  Specific location is specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will evaluate submissions to establish those within a competitive range.

Proposals submitted should be acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Prior to award of contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.

The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  All responsible sources not limited by the restrictions stated in the first paragraph the may submit a bid, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  

The RFP specification and Construction Documents are available by link via this announcement.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the Bid Documents via FEDTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.  Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov.  Contact Karen Poole, Contracting Officer, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4920 or fax her at 816-823-5935.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, George Gourse, at 816-823-2262.

Option period 1 (10/1/04-9/30/05).  Option period 2 (10/1/05-9/30/06).  Option period 3 (10/1/06-9/30/07).  The Fleet & Industrial Supply Center Puget Sound (FISCPS), in support of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS), has a requirement for Polyurethane in a 55-gallon drum capacity.

The Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to award a contract to provide technical information support resources for cancer preventive agent identification, development, and qualification for clinical trials.  The projects required to satisfy the RFP workscope shall provide the diverse and specialized technical support services and products needed for the preclinical and clinical development of the most promising cancer chemopreventive agents.  The contractor will be responsible for providing services that support the discovery and early development of new agents in chemoprevention through literature searching, class studies, and agent scoring. The preclinical and clinical drug testing is supported through a comprehensive system of documenting all test results and clinical activities related to the agent and agent combination through a computerized database.  The workscope of the RFP is divided into different task areas.  The task areas of the statement of work include:1) Cancer Preventive Agent Identification and Documentation; 2) Cancer Preventive Agent Data and Report Analysis, Status  and Documentation; 3) Information Management System; and 4) General Tasks.  These task areas are fully integrated and cohesive.  Offerors are required to respond to all task areas of the RFP as one package.  Comprehensive details of the information management system are expected to be provided by the offeror based on their knowledge of the disciplines required in the Statement of Work, as well as experience working in the multidisciplinary fields of chemoprevention.  However, the information management system must be compatible with and migrate to the existing DCP Enterprise System Knowledge base (DESK) requirements specified in the RFP. The proposed acquisition is a re-competition of contract N02-CN-05008 awarded to CCS Associates, Inc.   It is anticipated that one (1) level of effort, TERM type contract will be awarded and that the period of performance will consist of a base period of five (5) years plus two (2) option years for possible total of seven (7) contract years.  It is also anticipated that there will be options for additional hours for each contract year including option years six and seven.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for solicitation number NOI4064.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 325414, which has a size standard of 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure on a sole source basis from Hyclone Laboratories Inc., the only known source to provide this Lot #ANM20277 for 500ml bottles of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) quantity 300; 12 months storage/4 shipments.  The laboratory has used FBS from Hyclone for over 15 years and  have found their FBS to be consistently of a very high standard that is absolutely required in order to maintain and propagate the large number of different cell lines and primary cell cultures with diverse biological specificities that are used in by over 40 investigators in the laboratory.  One of the primary research efforts in our laboratory is the development of a vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).  We have developed an animal model system that utilizes viral infected rhesus macaques to assess the protective efficacy of potential candidate HIV-1 vaccines.  The ability to culture primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in vivo differentiated macrophages isolated directly from rhesus macaques is critical to this effort.  Culture of the primary cells is essential in order to evaluate the immunological responses in the animals to different vaccine regimens.  Prescreening of specific FBS lots is required in order to insure that the FBS selected will allow for the growth of the primary cells as well as propagation of the virus in these cells.  The screening process is very time consuming and requires specialized techniques to successfully isolate and properly culture these specific primary cell types from the animals.  The in vivo differentiated macrophage cultures are particularly sensitive to having the proper reagents and culture conditions.  The specific Lot #ANM20277 Fetal Bovine Serum from Hyclone indicated above has be screened in this regard and has been found to meet the criteria required to be used in our ongoing vaccine studies.  As the vaccine studies can take over three years to complete, are quite expensive to conduct and are currently ongoing, continuity in the quality of this essential tissue culture reagent is paramount to the successful continuance of our vaccine research.  Anticipated Date of delivery – May 10, 2004; place of delivery- NIH/NIAID, Maryland 20892; FOB origin.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items.

Offeror must include with their offer a completed copy of provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certications – Commercial Items.  As prescribed in 4.1104, use the following clause (52.204-7), Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) “Registered in the CCR database,” means that (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2)The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record ”Active.”  (By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation).

<DESC>The following is the full text of the Background Investigations Clause, which is hereby incorporated into the combined  synopsis/solicitation:  BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS Clause.   In accordance  with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family  Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441  Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all  positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with  or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation  and determination of suitability for employment.  Accordingly, all such  positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability)  determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian  Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program;  and, a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the  Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  A favorable screening (applicant  and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian  Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel  Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60  days of incorporation of this clause into a current/exiting contract.   Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the contractor  who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability)  determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a  Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42  U.S.C. 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background  investigation determination has been made.  Prior employment with the  Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs,  does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was  conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening  (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.   Prior to contract award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph  two, it is solely the company, individual or contractorâ€™s responsibility  to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at  (505) 248-6938/6939/6940/6383 in order to obtain a complete security  package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative  forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a  screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final  background investigation.   If an unfavorable screening (applicant and  suitability) determination is made, a contract shall not be awarded to the  individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has  proposed to employ the individual to perform the work.   The individual  and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be  determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant  and suitability) determination is made, which will make them ineligible  for contract award.   If an unfavorable final background investigation  determination is made, the contract may be terminated and the employee in  question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if  the service involves contact with or regular control over Indian children.    The following is hereby incorporated into the combined  synopsis/solicitation to clarify the task order award amount:    Task  orders shall be issued for different lengths of time with respect to the  length of performance.  When consultant services are required by the  Government, the Contracting Officer (CO) shall provide a copy of the  Statement of Work (SOW) to the contractor.  The SOW shall identify the  objective to be performed and the location of school/schools which  requires service, and other pertinent information to perform the task.     The CO shall request a cost proposal from the contractor to perform the  work.  The contractor shall provide a cost proposal based on the daily  rate awarded in their IDIQ contract times (x)  the number of days to  complete the task plus (+) travel costs, which shall be paid in accordance  with Federal Travel Regulations plus (+) the special item costs to perform  task order (e.g. certain materials), which have been certified in writing  by the Contracting Officer as constituting part of the contractorâ€™s  undertaking.  A firm fixed price task shall then be issued to the  contractor to perform the service, when agreement is met on the cost  proposal.  All previous terms and conditions apply.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO AMEND THE NAICS CODE FROM 541990 TO 541710. The Air Armament Enterprise System Program Office, Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, Florida is examining different approaches for integrating weapons into networks.  This Sources Sought Advance Notice is for R&D Market Research only.  Qualification packages are not requested nor desired.  The government is contemplating competitive and non-competitive acquisition strategies.  In order to meet the challenges of network-centric operations, development of a standardized approach for networked weapon data link communications and associated infrastructure is required.  The goal is to expand the role of weapons in the kill chain that includes weapons as a node in the network through a system-of-systems approach.  Integrating weapons into networks will enable improved weapon delivery, responsiveness, battlespace awareness and the capability to determine a weapon’s mission completion.  To meet the objectives of the Weapons Data Link Network (WDLN) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD), the contractor shall: (1) evaluate and assess the Weapons Data Link (WDL) portion of the existing Transformational Tactical Data Link Capabilities Development Document (TDL-CDD) for requirements and weapons requirements documents. The conclusion of the assessment process will be a recommendation for modifications to existing architecture and requirements documents. The contractor shall develop and update the appropriate associated Operational View (OV), Systems View (SV) and Technical View (TV) WDL architecture products required to define the weapon interface with the network. The contractor shall coordinate the development of the above products between the applicable weapons developers, network developers, and operators.  The objective is to develop a baseline (Net-Ready Key Performance Parameters for weapons) from which a common set of solutions for all DoD network nodes can be derived; (2) based on the WDL Concept of Operations scenarios, evaluate the impact of weapons on the network (to include network loading, infrastructure modifications and human factors) via modeling and simulation; (3) The contractor shall coordinate the integration of the above products into a weapon network flight demonstration for the JSOW, WCMD-ER, JASSM, and SDB munitions; upon completion of the demonstrations, compile final documentation of the above products and make recommendations for inclusion into the processes (e.g. Interoperability System Management and Requirements Transformation (iSMART)) for updating the TDL and WDL requirements documents; and (4) recommend a solution for weapon datalinks to achieve compliance with the JTRS Software Communication Architecture (SCA) by identifying those parts of SCA that seem appropriate for munitions, and highlighting cost drivers.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED, TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this synopsis or the Government’s use of submitted information.  Any information provided as a result of this synopsis may be used by the Air Force in future acquisition strategy decisions and could be used in future RFP(s) which may be released to industry.  If a competitive procedure is selected by the government, a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP) may be placed on the Government Website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Industry is requested to respond of intent to propose along with your company’s complete mailing address, point of contact and telephone number, email address.  

Industry responding to this sources sought synopsis should state whether they are or are not a small business concern or small, disadvantaged business concern as defined by FAR 52.219-1 and 52.219-2, respectively.  The NAICS code is 541710, size standard is 500 employees.

<RESPDATE>052404
<CONTACT>Jerry  Hendricks, (609)485-5726
<DESC>AIRCRAFT SHUTTLE PASSENGER SERVICE Note: This is a Request for Information Announcement.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) is requesting information from qualified businesses associated with NAICS code 48111 Titled â€œ Scheduled Passenger Air Transportationâ€. The WJHTC is hereby requesting information to assist in determining if the Governmentâ€™s requirement needs enhancement for future procurements and to determine current commercial industry capabilities. ** The FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center is currently under contract with an Aircraft Charter operator for shuttle passenger service between ACY (Atlantic City International Airport, NJ) and DCA (Ronald Reagan National Airport, Washington, DC). Normal schedule of passenger movement is eight (8) round trips per week (Tuesday thru Friday). ** The WJHTC intends to issue a Request for Proposal at some time in the future.  Attached to this RFI is a sample statement of work for that document.  Interested parties are invited to provide information to assist the government in preparing a final statement of work consistent with commercial practices and capabilities. WJHTC desires to afford maximum opportunity for contractors to provide comments.  From those comments, the government will tailor a final statement of work that allows for innovation and efficiency within the parameters of the governmentâ€™s need and request proposals. Following proposal evaluation, the government expects that the resultant contract will be a Firm-fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity award for a base year with four one year options. The following two (2) factors will be applied to determine the best value to the Government. The combined technical criteria (elements a, b, and c) may be considered more important then the price criteria. 1. TECHNICAL APPROACH: a. Backup/Contingency Plan: The WJHTC requires both on-time performance and actual completion of all round trip flights.

<SUBJECT>A--Request for Information (RFI) for Automated Sensor Management and Data Fusion Technology
<SOLNBR>W15P7T-04-I2WD-005
<RESPDATE>052204
<ARCHDATE>07212004
<CONTACT>Jane Calicari, (732)427-7077
<DESC>Description: This is a pre-solicitation REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).   I2WD is currently conducting market research only.  No award is intended as a result of this synopsis nor does the Government intend to pay for information received.  I2WD is in terested in receiving information on technology and products in development and/or off-the-shelf that can support a multi-sensor Mission Management (MM) Module, which will be used for the Eye-In-the-Sky (EIS) Science and Technology Objective (STO).   The MM module will perform sensor management and data fusion for multiple sensors aboard a common airborne platform.  This will include automated data correlation and target-tracking, as well as automated payload management for tasking and cross-cueing of sensors. The MM module will interface to existing sensors, an onboard aircraft GPS and inertial system, and communications link to a ground station.   The MM Module must be compatible with current and future military sensors as well as allow connectivity t o future DCGS-A, FCS, 10.2 and other Joint mission ground station/architectures. This implies reliance on an open, service based architecture.  The specific sensors used for the payload will be dependent on specific mission requirements.  The products shou ld perform the following tasks. The first task is to implement Level 1 Fusion onboard the aircraft for automated data correlation and target tracking using single or multi-INT sensors. The second task is to automatically recognize target behaviors and classify potential targets. The thir d task is to develop a limited Level 4 Fusion capability for automated sensor cross-cueing based on the outputs of Tasks 1 and 2. The fourth task is to automatically manage the onboard sensors based on the output of Task 3, as well as communicate with the operator on the ground.  The first task will start with the reception of raw data streams provided by the sensors such as GMTI, SAR, EO/IR, Hyperspectral, LIDAR, SIGINT, etc.  The software must validate all sensor data utilized by EIS.  Data must be checked and verified that it is  appropriate for processing. Potential targets within an image must recognized and isolated for processing. Single and Multi-Int Trackers and Correlators will then process the data. GMTI reports must be tracked and reports from both similar and dissimilar sensors must be temporally and spatially correlated.  For the second task, sensor reports and tracks must be automatically recognized for behaviors and classification. The software would use pre-mission rules defined by the Commanders Information Requests. The third task will take the findings from Tasks 1 and 2 to determine the best way to enhance this data by cross-cueing other available onboard sensors. This determination will be based on the capabilities of the current sensor packages and the results of target behavior processing. Using this data, sensor cueing recommendation will be generated.  Finally, the fourth task will take these recommendations and prioritize them based on the platforms current and future position.  Sensor taskings will be executed based on this prioritization schedule.   Ability to communicate with the control features of all on-board sensor is essential.  In addition, communication with the ground control station (DCGS-A, etc.) via a standardized communications link is also necessary. Once the all requested data is gathered, a report will be sent to the ground station. If the analyst on the ground requires the pedigree data, or additional data, the MM module should support a request from the ground station. Additionally, the MM module should support operator requests for sensor tasking or re-tasking.  A multi-INT sensor management system with automated data correlation, target-tracking, and cross-cueing can enhance battlespace knowledge while reducing the Intelligence Analysts workload. Responses to this RFI should be no more than 10 single sided pages per product , whether in development or off-the-shelf.  The responses should describe the technology, existing or projected performance capabilities, availability of any prototype, and a preliminary schedule for any prototype.  The response should also include a rough  order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for development of products or cost of off-the-shelf product.  Responses are to be received within 20 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All information must be in writing or via email, telephone requests for  additional information will not be honored. You may forward responses to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-BA (Mr. Fedorow)or the following e-mail address: Vincent.Fedorow@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The US Army Product Manager Individual Weapons (PMIW) is conducting a market investigation to identify possible sources of a training simulator to be used in force-on-force training that has the capability of simulating the effects of  the XM29 Air Burst Weapon System.  The XM29 is a dual weapon system that combines 5.56mm kinetic energy ammunition in a direct fire role and 25mm high explosive air burst ammunition (HEAB) in an indirect fire role.  This indirect fire role allows for the engagement of targets in defilade (i.e. behind walls,  trees, vehicles, in trenches, etc).   The weapon system utilizes a ruggedized,  compact, single, integrated full solution day/night target acquisition/fire control (TA/FC) capable of operations in all environments.  The TA/FC will have  a direct view powered optic mode, thermal sighting mode with automatic,  ballistically adjusted reticles.  It will include a laser range finder, a compass, cant and tilt, an environmental sensor suite; a fuze setter and an  internal display.  It will incorporate a full ballistic algorithm to facilitate  accurate placement of the airburst munition on target incorporating data from  the environmental and attitude sensors. The proposed solution must include the integration of the HEAB simulation  module with the current Modular Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) used  by the US Army for 5.56mm weapons.  It is anticipated that the integration  effort will take no more than eight (8) months and the test effort take no more  than six (6) months.  Two (2) sets of training simulation systems will be  purchased for a Government conducted test and evaluation program.  The  contractor is required to provide hardware support during the testing.  The  system selected must already be in production to allow for the integration and  test effort.   This market survey is for information purposes only; this is not a Request for  Quotation.

<SUBJECT>SURFACE MINE COUNTERMEASURES (SMCM) UNMANNED UNDERWATER VEHICLE (UUV) - INDUSTRY AWARENESS DAY/RISK MITIGATION WORKSHOP
<DESC>All interested contractors are invited to attend an Industry Day with U.S. Navy Fleet and acquisition personnel involved in advancing the capabilities of unmanned underwater vehicles in Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) applications.  This event will be held on 26 May 2004 at the Navy Memorial in Washington, DC (701 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20004).  The yellow and green Metro lines serve the Navy Memorial.  The objective of this meeting is to provide an opportunity for early industry involvement in the Government's proposed approach for the future procurement of un-tethered, unmanned, underwater Mine Countermeasures (MCM) systems that will support the Surface Mine Countermeasures (SMCM) mission in the Shallow Water (SW) and deeper water zones (40 – 600 feet sea water (FSW)).  Unmanned vehicles have the potential of addressing the two key, overarching MCM measures of e ffectiveness (MOE), which are to: 1) Reduce the overall MCM tactical timeline; and 2) Reduce the overall risk to MCM forces.  UUVs have the potential to systematically reconnoiter predetermined geographic areas (nominally 5NM X 5NM) and precisely mapping the bottom contour while providing information to assist in the classification of objects that exhibit mine-like characteristics.  Additionally, unmanned vehicles equipped with high-resolution sensors can be used to reacquire and identify previously mapped targets of interest.  The SMCM UUVs must be deployable from MHC/MCM platform(s) with existing shipboard equipment.  The vehicles will need to possess mobile ingress/egress capabilities to enable them to move from a launch point of up to nominal ranges at 5 NM or greater.  Data recorded by the vehicle must be transferable to compatible Navy tactical displays and information sy stems (i.e. GCCS/MEDAL (Minewarfare Environmental Data and Aides Library)) to facilitate the re-acquisition of targets during subsequent missions by USN Mine Warfare assets.  Currently, the U.S. Navy is exploring SMCM UUV concepts, as demonstrated through the extensive leadership and efforts of the Office of Naval Research in this area of technology. Current efforts include the use of existing hardware to gain fleet feedback and to assist in refining requests for initiation of an acquisition program in FY06.  Input received from this Industry Day will facilitate the development of a future competitive solicitation.  Similar to the early involvement of industry in the acquisition effort, early Fleet involvement is also being pursued. Two limited-scope demonstration events were conducted during 2003.  The results of these demonstrations reinforced the value of UUV systems in supp orting the SMCM mission and a summary of the results of these demonstrations will occur at the Industry Day.  Multiple limited scope evaluations are currently being pursued by NSWC-PC (Solicitation N61331-04-R-0014).  These evaluations will begin in FY04 and will be completed in FY05.  A full-scale acquisition is expected to start in FY06.     A notional Acquisition Strategy for fielding a first generation SMCM deployed UUV system will also be briefed.  Industry input is desired to allow for an effective acquisition program with well-defined requirements in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Attendance at the Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop is not a prerequisite for ultimately submitting any future proposals.  However, it will provide a valuable opportunity for questions & answers and industry input into the read-ahead documentation.  Seating is limited.  Reque st a maximum of two (2) representatives per vendor.  Request attendees’ register for the Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop by providing Company/Organization Name, Name(s) of attendees, Company/Organization affiliation, Address, Telephone Number, and e-mail address not later than 17 May 2004.  Registration data must be Faxed or e-mailed to the Technical POC identified below.  Approximately one month prior to the SMCM UUV Industry Day, read ahead documents will be available electronically from the Technical POC for any interested contractor.  Registered attendees will be sent this read ahead information by e-mail when available.  Any advance questions and/or comments pertaining to the Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop or the read-ahead documentation may be Faxed or e-mailed to the Technical POC so that they can be addressed at Industry Day.  The purpos e of this Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop is not to obtain proposals and is solely to offer early industry involvement in a contemplated U.S. Navy procurement.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information obtained during the workshop or for the time and expense of the industry participants involved.  For questions please contact the Technical POC: Robert Buhl (850) 235-5052, FAX (850) 234-4644   e-mail Robert.Buhl@navy.mil

<SUBJECT>D -- Request for Industry Comment—Advantages/Disadvantages of Centralized Local Exchange Service Contracts
<DESC>The purpose of this RFI is to determine the feasibility of pursuing a state-wide consolidation of local telephone exchange service contracts.   We are contemplating issuing a firmed-fixed, “Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ or “D”) type contract per state subject to PUC required tariff increases.  Task orders will be issued against the “D” contract for each Air Force location upon expiration of their current contract.  This concept will require the contractor to be certified by the PUC within each state; however, we would consider teaming arrangements to fulfill this requirement.  A teaming arrangement does not include prime/sub relationships where one company is certified and the other is not; every member of the team must be a certified provider.  Interested parties are requested to provide comments or discussion on the following areas of concern: (1) Would industry be able to propose prices that are valid state-wide (i.e., commercial business line price consistent from one city to another for a recruiting office)?  (2) Will a charge be applied for a yearly update to the Appendix 10 (list of current services) of the Statement of Work?  (3) How would industry address diversity issues at the “D” contract level, or do you foresee this being addressed at the task order level?  (4) Should DSL requirements be included in this consolidation approach?  (5) Would industry be able to price taxes on a state-wide basis?  (6) Can industry offer any special discounts based on this consolidation effort; based upon the potential quantities of telephone services, what volume of savings is realistically to be expected by the USAF?  (7)  Would industry be able to provide pricing for non-common high bandwidth-type services at individual sites using a consolidated state-wide pricing table?  (8) Would industry be able to provide pricing for services associated with a mileage charge using a consolidated state-wide pricing table?  (9) What impact would the rural exemption areas have on this type of requirement, or could this be an area to be considered for a teaming arrangement?  (10)  What does industry consider to be a fair base period given allowance for cutover, if necessary?  (11) If not a state-wide consolidation, can you recommend other consolidation approaches (i.e., BPA-type arrangement)?  

Responses shall be provided via e-mail to cathy.summers@tinker.af.mil and tomma.hofegartner@tinker.af.mil .  The government may consider one-on-one meetings with industry in the future.  The suspense date for submitting responses is 24 May 2004.

5.   Market Value: $62,905 to $81,778 per annum [GS-13 equiv.]  Final compensation will be based

7.   Place of Performance: USAID/Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

8.   Scope of Work:  


A.   Background of the Project

As a member of USAID/Ethiopia’s Office of Food and Humanitarian Assistance (FHA), the incumbent will serve as Safety Net Advisor (SNA) to the Mission.  The SNA will provide expertise in guiding the integration and effective utilization of “safety nets” into the Mission’s overall strategy, especially focusing on activities managed by the FHA office.  The SNA will also be the primary point of contact for food security matters on the FHA team, and will represent USAID/Ethiopia in broader donor and government safety net and food security initiatives. This position is open to US citizens, TCNs and eligible family members.
The Safety Net Program currently being designed for Ethiopia is based on the idea that the predictably vulnerable require predictable assistance if they are to protect-- or rebuild-- assets, and that providing consistent, multi-year assistance to vulnerable households in ways which strengthen their and their communities’ coping abilities is necessary to re-attain and maintain food security in the long-term.  The safety net program, focusing more on mechanisms than objectives, is designed around three basic transfer mechanisms: Unconditional transfers, Conditional Transfers, and Public Works.   Labor intensive public works are meant to provide resource transfers to chronically food insecure families capable of providing labor.  Conditional transfers are meant to provide transfers to support or enable positive behaviors (education, skills transfer, training, health practices).  Unconditional transfers are meant to provide transfers to labor-poor chronically vulnerable households unlikely to benefit from Conditional Transfer activities.  








The use of safety nets has been integrated throughout USAID/Ethiopia’s new strategic framework, but is more focused on the Intermediate Result (IR) to protect, diversify and expand livelihoods under the Strategic Objective (SO) Private-Sector Led Economic Growth.  This approach reflects the Mission’s significant experience with famine mitigation in Ethiopia, and its work over the past four years to develop innovative program approaches to addressing both emergency and chronic food insecurity during and between periods of shock in Ethiopia.  The use of safety nets also reflects a growing consensus among the government, donor, and Mission implementing partners that “predictable” food insecurity and vulnerability cannot be addressed through emergency programming, and that the growing numbers of chronically food insure in all regions of Ethiopia present pressing justification for the design of dramatically different approach to reducing food insecurity here.

B. ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION: 
The position is the Safety Net Advisor (SNA).  The SNA will be a part of the USAID/Ethiopia’s Food and Humanitarian Assistance (FHA) team, and will work with all Mission strategic objectives (SO) teams, as well as contributing to related crosscutting theme activities.  The SNA will directly support senior Mission management as well as relevant offices in the Embassy in formulating and articulating appropriate food security strategy policy and activities to address vulnerability among the chronically food insecure, including the development and utilization of safety nets.
The SNA will contribute to the Mission’s work in food security policy dialogue, including the ongoing design and integration of a safety net approach, with senior officials of the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (GFDRE), other donor agencies, and USAID partner organizations.  In addition, the SNA will also guide and monitor USAID’s P.L. 480, Title II supported developmental relief programs.  In particular, the SNA will have an important role in reorienting Title II programming to support and participate in the GFDRE’s Safety Net Program currently under design.
The incumbent will be required to have a demonstrated in depth knowledge and experience in safety net concepts and applications, food security and related technical fields.  The incumbent will have the ability to work independently with very minimal supervision, and possess strong diplomatic and interpersonal skills to bring to bear on contacts and negotiations with senior-level representatives of the GFDRE, other donor agencies, and USAID partner organizations.  






C. SUPERVISORY CONTROLS: 
The SNA will report to the Chief of the FHA Office at USAID/Ethiopia.  S/he will provide in-depth briefings on safety net and food security issues for the Ambassador and Mission staff and may receive guidance from senior Mission management as the situation warrants. The FHA Office Chief will provide operational guidance, including developing a quarterly work plan based on Mission requirements.  The SNA will be expected to work independently with minimal supervision over extended periods, within the framework of the work plan.  The incumbent will not have direct supervisory duties. 
D. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: 
Specific responsibilities will include but are not limited to the following: 
1. Stay abreast of current GFDRE and donor thinking with regard to chronic and cyclic food insecurity in Ethiopia, including: 
•	Overall food security policy, strategy and programs 
•	GFDRE safety net programming
•	The division of the chronic and acute caseloads between the DPPC and Food Security Offices
•	Cash based relief and livelihood programming
These tasks will require senior level contacts in both the GFDRE and donor community, including active participation with Ethiopia’s Coalition for Food Security.  The SNA is expected to also remain generally informed of the latest in food security and vulnerability professional literature, specifically as regards safety nets.
2. Report periodically to the USAID Mission senior management team on the development and implementation of safety nets within both Mission and GFDRE programs and provide related recommendations.  The incumbent will report to the FHA Office Chief, and, as appropriate, directly to the Director and Deputy Director on specific assignments, keeping the FHA Office Chief informed.  Position and briefing papers will be timely and of the highest quality level, researching and identifying potential problems, optional courses of action, and policy recommendations. 
3. Network with the GFDRE and other donors at senior levels with regard to safety net matters in an effort to adopt common approaches, identify issues, set the policy agenda, and propose recommended solutions acceptable to key stakeholders.  The SNA will represent USAID/Ethiopia senior management in working level meetings below the Ministerial/Ambassadorial level, except as otherwise instructed.


4. Take a lead role in safety net-related coordination meetings, in close collaboration with the GFDRE and donors involved in the effort.  The SNA will be expected to assist in coordinating meetings, and participate in dialogue, decision-making, and follow-up.
5. Actively participate as a member of the GFDRE led multi-agency safety net design group.  The SNA will be expected to assist in coordinating meetings, and participate in dialogue, decision-making, and follow-up.  The SNA will work towards coordinating donor and Food Security Office (FSO)/DPPC responses to develop an appropriate and sustainable solution to chronic and cyclic food insecurity through minimizing food aid distributions and refocusing efforts on asset building. 
6. Represent USAID/Ethiopia at other food security forums, e.g. the Food Security and Agriculture Committee of the Donor Advisory Group (DAG). 
7. Analyze and write regular updates of progress in food security policy and safety net development for dissemination through Mission channels, including the USAID-funded FEWS NET newsletter.  The objective of these updates will be to broaden general awareness and to increase GFDRE, other donor agency, and USAID partner organization involvement. 
8. Participate fully and, as necessary, provide oversight to safety net related programs and activities under the Mission’s long-term goal, objectives, and results framework. This will include guiding and monitoring the Mission’s P.L. 480, Title II supported developmental relief programs.  Keep the FHA Office Chief, the Director and Deputy Director apprised of progress and issues impeding results.
9. Work closely with Food Security Offices to build capacity to implement food and cash-based safety net programs on a multi-annual basis.  This will involve intensive collaboration between the DPPC and the FSO to begin to identify the chronic and acute caseload among other tasks. 
USAID Core Values 
The SNA is responsible for understanding and incorporating the USAID core values in all aspects of his/her work.  These core values are:
1. Customer Focus: 
•	Identifies and communicates with USAID customers regularly (ideally, in their preferred language); surveys their interests, needs and recommendations; follows up on communications and information received from and about the customers.

•	Surveys customer satisfaction periodically and serves as a knowledgeable advocate for customer service with other USAID employees and partners. 



2. Teamwork and Participation: 
•	Contributes to strategic planning, performance monitoring, and major program decisions of the SO team. 
•	Demonstrates ownership of the teams' plans, performance, and decisions. 
•	Proactively participates in team processes and activities.

•	Defines specific operational and program results needed for his/her area of responsibility.

•	Serves as a knowledgeable advocate for the results orientation with other USAID employees and partners.
4. Empowerment and Accountability: 
•	Emphasizes results rather than oversight, and service outreach rather than internal control, in carrying out his/her responsibilities. 
•	Is clear about his/her own performance standards. 
•	Participates in defining objectives, reviewing performance, and upholding accountability for the accomplishment of objectives.

1. Education:  An advance degree directly related to international development assistance, with an emphasis on broad issues of food security.  
2. Professional Experience:  A minimum of seven years experience working with donors in relevant areas, including rural development, agricultural development, food aid assistance, and poverty reduction.

Background and Objective: NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) provides scientific and technical support to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for the management, conservation, and wise use of the west coast's marine and anadromous resources.  The NWFSC’s Marine Mammal Program focuses on emerging management issues in the Pacific northwest.  The program’s focus includes contaminant effects on populations, prey resources including improving techniques for fatty acid analyses and stable isotopes, energetics, climate and environmental relationships with marine mammal populations, and cumulative risk analyses.  This information will be used to facilitate management and conservation of killer whales.  Services Required:  Provide data to characterize the effects of vessel traffic on killer whale behavior in San Juan Islands area of Puget Sound.  Study areas to be determined and evaluated through collaboration between both parties.  The focus of the research shall be on how habitat use and behavioral energetics of Southern Resident pods are affected by vessel activity.  This order is broken into four tasks: 1) Conduct land-based behavioral observations of killer whales for at least two sites in the Haro Strait during the peak whale season (May – August) in the summer of 2004.  These surveys shall be conducted during daylight hours using an electronic theodolite in conjunction with a spotting scope and binoculars for consistency in data collection methodology.  2) Characterize the behavior of killer whales at these sites in the presence and absence of vessel traffic.  Behaviors should be recorded and categorized according to published behavioral states of killer whales.  Additional criteria are as outlined:  2.1) Detailed behavioral data shall be collected from focal animals representing the range of age-classes present (e.g. adult females, adult males, calves, juveniles, etc.); 2.2) Conduct Scan-sampling to characterize behaviors of the group in conjunction with data collection on focal animals; and 2.3) Identify focal animals from existing photo identification databases so that behavioral responses of different pods can be compared.  3) Collect killer whale behavioral data during varying levels of vessel traffic and also characterize the number of vessels present, types of vessels present, distance between killer whales and vessels, and vessel activity. 4) Retain sufficient sample sizes of control (no vessels present) and treatment (vessels present) data to permit statistical analyses to quantify vessel effects on killer whale behavior. Perform appropriate statistical analyses on the data collected including, but not limited to, Canonical correlations, Markov-chain modeling.  Specific analyses will be agreed upon following consultation with NWFSC staff.  The contractor must have a demonstrated background and experience in conducting such analyses.  5) Contractor must have prior experience conducting this type of research in the San Juan Islands region and have permission for access to suitable land-based sites.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

As prescribed in 11.404(a)(2), insert the following clause:
Time of Delivery (Jun 1997)
(a) The Government requires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:
REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE
Requirement is for a total of one hundred and five (105) vehicles, which includes seventy five midsize (five passenger capable) sedan cars, two (2) mini-vans, and eight (8) compact pickups between the inclusive dates of 3 June and 24 June 2004, a short-term rental period of varying delivery and pickup times.  All 105 vehicles will be delivered to and picked up by the contractor at the same address, 321 Cullen Street, Shaw AFB SC.
ITEM NO.	QUANTITY	ON OR BEFORE
Midsize rental cars 	75	3 June 04
Midsize rental cars 	20	7 June 04
Mini-vans	2	7 June 04
Compact Pickup Trucks 	8	7 June 04
The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply.
OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE
ITEM NO.	QUANTITY	ON OR BEFORE
		
		
		
		
(b) The delivery dates or specific periods above are based on the assumption that the Government will make award by 20 May 2004. Each delivery date in the delivery schedule above will be extended by the number of calendar days after the above date that the contract is in fact awarded. Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails.

If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separated solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is set aside for small business (no more than 500 employees). ****  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Time and Frequency Division, has a requirement for measurement hardware to be used in the construction of a backup time scale system.  The primary system is currently located at the NIST laboratories in Boulder, CO.  The backup system in Fort Collins must provide time and frequency reference for all NIST services if the clock ensemble at the NIST Boulder site becomes inoperable or unavailable for any reason. ****  In order to support the current NIST services, the system in Fort Collins must provide time signals at 1 (one) pulse per second and 1 (one) MHz that can be directly traced to the NIST clock in Boulder under normal conditions, and to international time standards should the clock ensemble in Boulder fail or become unavailable.  The accuracy required must be no worse than 10 ns, but the design is also driven by the need for reliability, robustness and the capability for remote supervision and maintenance. ****  The system will be implemented using a number of commercial cesium standards.  This will reduce the possibility that the operation will be interrupted by the failure of a single clock.  The time delivered to the NIST services will be the weighted average of the times of these devices as modified by offsets in time and frequency determined by comparing the Fort Collins ensemble output with the time of the primary clock ensemble in Boulder using common-view GPS or to another standard time reference if the data from Boulder are not available for an extended period of time. ****  THIS PROCUREMENT is for the system that will measure the time differences between the atomic clocks in the ensemble and computes this weighted average.  In addition, this system will provide diagnostic reports and status messages to a remote operations facility that will be located in Boulder.  This will support a full integration of the clocks in Fort Collins with the existing ensemble in Boulder, and will also support a “hold-over” mode, in which the Fort Collins system runs without any monitoring from Boulder if the link to Boulder is broken or if the ensemble time in Boulder becomes unavailable for any reason. ****  REQUIREMENT No. 1:  The system shall make time difference measurements between 1 (one) clock which is designated as the reference clock for the system, and up to 7 (seven) other clocks.  The measurements shall be made using a dual mixer type system which accepts inputs at the standard frequency of 5 (five) MHz.  The ability to make measurements at 10MHz is desirable, if the overall noise performance of the hardware is not compromised by this capability.  A system that can make measurements only a 1 (one) pps is not acceptable because such a system cannot support the requirement outlined in requirement no. 3, below.  ****  REQUIREMENT No. 2:  The system shall be composed of a base system (chassis, power supply, network interface, etc.) and a sufficient number of measurement modules to support the required number of clocks outlined above.  The base system shall be capable of handling up to 28 clocks with the purchase of additional measurement modules.  ****  REQUIREMENT No. 3:  The noise of a single time-difference measurement (evaluated by connecting the same clock to two independent channels) SHALL BE NO GREATER THAN 0.6 ps RMS,  AND THE NOISE SHALL BE CHARACTERIZED AS WHITE PHASE NOISE OUT TO AN AVERAGING TIME OF AT LEAST 2000 SECONDS. This is a fundamental requirement of the system.  It is required to support the overall performance of the system.  ****  REQUIREMENT No. 4:  The system shall support communication via A TCP/IP INTERFACE to support oversight and management from Boulder.  The capability to manage the system remotely is very important, since the system will be managed from Boulder under normal circumstances.  This will be done to ensure that the time computed by the ensemble in Fort Collins tracks the time of the official primary ensemble in Boulder as closely as possible.  In addition, it is very desirable to use a standard, widely available interface protocol to communicate with the system.  This will make it much easier to support the system in the future.  Systems that depend on specific proprietary hardware for this communications link are much less desirable, since almost all special-purpose hardware designs become obsolete and unavailable in a time that is very short relative to the projected lifetime of this system of 10-20 years.  The current system in Boulder is over 24 years old. ****  REQUIREMENT No. 5:  The system shall be implemented in duplicate hardware so that there is no single point of failure.  The design is to include two completely independent measurement systems with no common hardware. ****  REQUIREMENT No. 6:  The system proposed by the supplier must be  commercial off-the-shelf and available for delivery within 90 days after receipt of the order so that the system can be operational no later than September 30, 2004.  At least one other operating unit must have already been delivered, with customer contact information for that delivered unit included in the response to this RFQ. ****  NAICS Code:  334519.  Business Size Standard:  500 employees. ****  Quotes will be evaluated upon technical merit and price.  Technical merit will be evaluated for conformance with Requirements 1 – 6 as set forth above per the standards of FAR Part 13.1.  ****   The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors – Commercial, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision;  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items – The government will award a fixed price purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer will represent the best value to the government, price and other factors considered;  FAR 52.212-3,  Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items – Offerors must include a completed copy of Offeror Representations and Certifications along with the offer;  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision;  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The following additional FAR clauses are applicable to this acquisition:  52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35 Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era; 52.222-36  Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities;  52.222-37  Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era;  52.225-3  Buy American Act—Supplies.  ****  Terms and conditions in full text, including FAR 52.212-3 (Representations and Certifications) can accessed at http://www.arnet.gov/far.  Agency level protest procedures can be accessed at http://www.doc.gov/oam/conops/#reference. ***   Responses to this combined solicitation/notice are due no later than May 14, 2004 and must fully respond to all requirements set forth in this RFQ.  The anticipated award date is May 18, 2004.  Responses may be mailed, faxed or electronically (preferred) submitted to the attention of:  Ms. Kelly Rima, Purchasing Agent, at:  325 Broadway, MC3, Boulder, CO 80305; 303-497-3163; or Kelly.Rima@noaa.gov.  Inquiries regarding this RFQ must be faxed or emailed to Ms. Rima.  No verbal requests, please.

<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service in North Carolina announces a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for Architect and Engineering firms interested in contracting for A&E Services with emphasis in wetland restoration, water management, and other associated conservation practices.  Engineering services are required for the preparation of plans, specifications, cost estimates, related studies, and all associated engineering services for the planning, design and construction of wetland restoration projects in various locations in North Carolina.  THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED and is therefore open to all businesses regardless of size.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541310, which has a size standard of $4 million in average receipts.

The Government contemplates the award of possible multiple Firm-Fixed Price; Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts resulting from this competition.  The initial contract period will be for one year and the government may, at its option, extend the contract to a maximum of five years by exercising each of the four one year renewal options.  Work under each of the contracts will  be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.  The firms selected are guaranteed a minimum of $3,000 in fees for the base year.  There is no guaranteed minimum for the option years, if exercised.  The amount awarded in fees for each year of the contract (base year and each option year, if exercised)will not exceed a maximum of $750,000.  Task Orders will be negotiated as firm fixed-price procurements for individual or clusters of conservation practices.  

Task Orders are expected to include civil, agricultural, and/or environmental engineering services and other services as needed to plan, design, and implement wetland restoration practices.  Engineering services are required to perform all phases of preliminary investigation, plan, design, and construction 
supervision of practices.  Task orders may include performance of any part or all services required to design and/or implement designated conservation/engineering practices on lands where NRCS is authorized to work under various programs.  

Services requested may 	require performing (1) field investigations; (2) engineering surveys; (3) geologic 	and soils investigations; (4) soil testing and evaluations;
(5) design and preparation of engineering plans and construction and construction specifications; and (6) construction layout, construction inspection (quality assurance), and certification of completed practices.  All work shall be performed in accordance with NRCS standards, specifications, policy, handbooks, procedures, North Carolina supplements to the referenced documents and the rules and regulations of the State of North Carolina.   

These contracts could also include design for repair and/or replacement of existing systems and the development of wetland restoration plans for designed practices.  Services may involve direct consultation, supervision and inspection of construction for a specific project, including reviews and approvals of shop drawings, material selections, quality control testing such as those associated with work being performed.  Responses should include proposed sub-consultants for all disciplines including civil, agricultural, environmental, geo-technical, and soil mechanics engineering, and nutrient management planning and application.  Responses should also include the qualifications
of personnel and description of facilities, materials, equipment and services to perform the type of tasks described by this notice.  The preparation of construction and design documents shall be in electronic format and with approved NRCS computer software.  All design drawings will be submitted using 	AutoCAD, version 2000 or later or other similar CAD software that is directly convertible to AutoCAD.

Preselection Criteria.  Project manager must be a Registered Professional Engineer licensed in the state of North Carolina.  Those firms that meet the requirements described and wish to be considered must submit an SF330 (Forms SF254 and SF255 may be submitted in lieu of an SF330) to Jane D. LaBounty,
Contracting Officer, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 4405 Bland Road, Suite 205, Raleigh, NC  27609.  It must be received in this office no later than 4 p.m. on May 24, 2004.  The SF330 (or Forms SF254 and SF255) must clearly indicate the office location where the work will be performed and the 
qualifications of the individuals and subcontractors proposed to work on the contract and their geographical location.

<DESC>Evaluation of USAID/OFDA Efforts Against Cassava Mosaic Disease
1997 – 2004


This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation.  The US Agency for International Development, Bureau of Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance, Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/DCHA/OFDA) intends to award a Purchase Order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for the services outlined below.  Proposals should include a brief work plan, budget, and the resume of the evaluator.  Proposals should be submitted electronically to the contacts at the bottom of this solicitation.  Proposals must be received by 5:00 pm, Thursday, May 6, 2004.

PURPOSE:

The U.S. Agency for International Development’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) seeks to evaluate its efforts to combat Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) from 1997 to the present.  This evaluation will focus on the effectiveness, sustainability, and overall impact of OFDA’s support to the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) for CMD-related activities.  OFDA seeks one experienced professional to conduct research in the field and Washington over an estimated period of 41 days.


BACKGROUND:

Since 1997, OFDA has been funding work to combat the Cassava Mosaic Disease in eastern, central, and western Africa.  CMD is devastating to cassava, which is a valuable food security crop to subsistence farmers throughout most of the continent.  Over the past seven years, OFDA has provided approximately $1.7 million to the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture to monitor the spread of the disease and to multiply and disseminate cassava plant varieties that are resistant to CMD. 


EVALUATION QUESTIONS:

The evaluation will address the following series of questions.

•	What outputs have resulted from OFDA funding to IITA, from 1997 to the present?  

•	Approximately how many households have benefited from the project?  What were the broad demographic characteristics of the project’s beneficiaries?  Were any vulnerable populations in target countries excluded from the project’s impacts?

•	How has the IITA CMD project impacted productivity and food security for small subsistence farmers?  Have the IITA activities resulted in a real and tangible difference in farmers’ lives?  

•	What was the geographic scope of the project?  Was this scope appropriate?

•	Have other donors provided support to complement OFDA’s funding to IITA in combating cassava mosaic disease?

•	Are there any ways in which the effectiveness and sustainability of the CMD project could be enhanced?

•	Have there been any unanticipated side effects to the IITA CMD project, positive or negative?

•	Should OFDA continue to fund the IITA CMD program as currently organized?  In what capacity should OFDA be involved?  What criteria might OFDA use in determining whether similar projects should be funded in the future?

 
METHODOLOGY AND ESTIMATED TIMELINE:

The notional start date for the evaluation is May 2004.  The evaluator will conduct the evaluation and complete the report by end of September 2004. 

The evaluator will review documents and available data, conduct interviews and organize field interviews with the assistance of IITA prior to embarking on field visits (estimated at 10 days). S/he may review strategic assessments, grant files, and other relevant documents. The OFDA Evaluation Coordinator will assist with facilitation of meetings and procurement of documents as necessary.

The evaluator will then conduct field visits and data collection in Uganda, Tanzania, and/or Kenya in July or August 2004 (estimated at 20 days).  IITA will assist in identifying appropriate key informants, establishing contacts and organizing field visits. The IITA research will accompany the evaluator for at least some of the field visits.

The evaluator will write a report of his/her findings (estimated at 7 days).  The evaluator will draft the report, and will provide a draft copy to the OFDA Evaluation Coordinator.  

The evaluator will debrief USAID staff (estimated at 2 days).  Approximately one week after delivery of the draft report to OFDA for review, the evaluator will conduct one or more briefings in Washington over one to two days for managers and staff from OFDA and other parts of USAID, and possibly the NGO community.  The briefings will present findings and will solicit feedback.

Incorporation of feedback & delivery of final report (estimated at 2 days).  The evaluator will present a final copy of the report to OFDA (which may or may not incorporate feedback received in the debriefings, at the discretion of the evaluator).


DELIVERABLES:

The evaluator will produce the following deliverables:

Work Plan:  Prior to departure to the field, the evaluator will provide to OFDA a 1 page written strategy detailing how the evaluation will be completed, for OFDA review and approval.  The work plan will include a list of potential interviewees, a draft list of interview questions, and a description of any other data collection instruments (e.g., surveys) to be used.

Field Debrief: Upon completion of research in July and August 2004, the evaluator will provide a courtesy debrief of preliminary findings to IITA staff, and will request preliminary feedback which may be incorporated into the final report.

Written Report:  The evaluator shall write and present for review a first draft of the evaluation report at least one week prior to the oral OFDA briefings (discussed above).  The report will include an executive summary, overview of IITA’s OFDA-funded CMD activities, description of methodology, and a detailed description of the evaluation’s findings and recommendations.  Additional information including itinerary, interviewee lists, questionnaires, surveys, and bibliography should be included in annexes.  The report should be no more than 25 pages, excluding annexes.  No later than ten calendar days following the final oral briefings and taking into account any new information obtained, the evaluator will prepare and deliver a final version of the evaluation report, including twenty bound copies and an electronic copy.

SELECTION CRITERIA:

Proposals will be ranked based on the following factors:

•	Qualifications of Evaluator:
o	Years of practical experience and/or advanced academic training concerning tropical agriculture, including specific familiarity with Cassava Mosaic Disease;  (at least five years  are required);
o	Demonstrated experience assessing impact of relief or development interventions;

<CONTACT>Jennifer Reynolds, 805-594-6295
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  The California Army National Guard intends to purchase Advisory & Assistance services.  The Statement of Work is as follows:  The National Interagency Civil-Military Institute is a National Guard-affiliated school in San Luis Obispo, California that specializes in training mid and high level military and civilian law enforcement personnel, focusing historically on counter-drug strate gy, techniques, and management, and has recently moved toward a focus on counter-terrorism and consequence management training.  After September 11, demand for training in counter-terrorism strategy, techniques, and management for law enforcement personnel increased dramatically.  While a number of state and local law enforcement training programs have existed in the counter-terrori sm field, new programs have sprung up to fill the demand.  Billions of dollars are now being spent by the federal government to satisfy the need for first responder equipment and training, including many new training programs focused on state and local law  enforcement.  While nationwide training capacity expansion is essential, it is important to take advantage of resources and expertise that are currently available to maximize efficiency and cost-savings related to establishing new programs.  Because of its physical location close to areas identified as highly subject to terrorist actions where law enforcement must be highly alert and trained, because it has a proven effective track record in training the first responder community in counter-dr ug issues, and because of the National GuardÃ¢Â€Â™s ground-level proximity to state & local personnel, NICI is well positioned to translate its success in drug law enforcement training to an enhanced offering of courses specializing in homeland security, c onsequence management, & anti-terrorism training.  Policymakers & strategists within the National Guard, DoD in general, & in Congress need to be made aware of the unique capabilities of NICI so that decisions on allocating counterterrorism training resour ces can be made more effectively & efficiently. This Statement of Work has been developed to outline services & deliverables that will ultimately help NICI develop a strategic plan that will enable its successful track record in drug law enforcement training to be translated into expanded offerings of c ounter-terrorism & consequence management training programs.  In NICI, the National Guard has a ready-made infrastructure, experienced instructors, a well-seasoned course management team, & an extensive network of law enforcement & military alumni & other contacts that could allow a smooth transition to an expanded offering of courses that focus on counter-terrorism methods & strategies.   While NICI has been offering courses in consequence management since immediately after September 11th, these activities have not been fully integrated into the organizational mission of NICI, & NICI has not adequately communicated the value of a long-term,  lasting focus on counter-terrorism & consequence management to appropriate constituencies.  This SOW is developed with an eye toward assisting NICI in preserving its reputation for training excellence while emphasizing the benefits of utilizing the existi ng NICI infrastructure & network for timely & valuable training in the counter-terrorism area.   Deliverables during the course of this project would consist of an historical review of NICIÃ¢Â€Â™s programs, compilation of output data & outcome data to the maximum extent possible indicative of NICIÃ¢Â€Â™s historical effectiveness, identification of add itional strategic issue areas that concern state & local law enforcement related to counter-terrorism training, & projected options that NICI could pursue to facilitate the expansion of counter-terrorism training courses while remaining a respected center for drug-rela ted training. In particular, the ultimate objective will be to provide a concise executive summary including recommendations, plus a formal extended-length report to support the recommendations in the executive summary, both of which can assist policy & decision makers in gaining a better understanding of NICIÃ¢Â€Â™s objectives & needs. This Statement of Work defines the effort to be performed in support of the National Interagency Civil-Military InstituteÃ¢Â€Â™s strategic plan development.  The contractor will work directly with NICI staff and will interview selected participants in the NICI training programs, as well as selected state & local agencies who are beneficiaries of NICIÃ¢Â€Â™s training services to develop the required documents & recommendations.  The contractor will also review NICIÃ¢Â€Â™s existing & historical strategic plan s & mission assessments.   Conduct historical review of NICIÃ¢Â€Â™s programs, to include the scope of training services offered over time, resource allocation over time, & overall funding levels over time.  Conduct a review of past NICI strategic plans.  Compile historical output & outcome data to the extent information is available.   Using information gathered through the Research task, organize & draft a report including assessment of needed strategic counterterrorism training issue areas & assessment of resources required to carry out NICIÃ¢Â€Â™s long-term program objectives. Draft an executive summary of the report & include concrete recommendations to inform the development of NICIÃ¢Â€Â™s strategic plan.  The executive summary must be concise & tailored to relevant policy & decision making audiences in the National Guard, DoD , & Congress. Provide a contract manager who shall be responsible for all work performance.  At least four qualified individuals will perform work under this contract & each should possess in-depth knowledge of both counter-drug & counter-terrorism issues, as well as la w enforcement & national security issues, including experience in law enforcement & experience in federal counter-drug & counter-terrorism policy. Milestones should be as follows; Contract plus 30 days (project design), Contract plus 90 days (progress report), Contract plus 120 days (research summary), Contract plus 180 days (assessment of state & local counter-terrorism training needs), Contract plu s 210 days (progress report), Contract plus 240 days (final report), Contract plus 270 days (executive summary, recommendations, & final report submitted). All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR).  Quotes are due no later than 2:00pm on April 30th, 2004.  Point of contact for this solicitation is SPC Jennifer Reynolds at (805) 594-6295.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 01 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR FUEL DISPENSING TRUCK.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to supply questions and answers pertaining to the fuel dispensing truck. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Questions and Answers are as follows: Q.  What is the total GVWR rating needed for the truck?  With the axles and suspension requested we can have the GVWR of the chassis rated from 25,950 lbs to 29,000 lbs.  Price does not change with these ratings.  However, the ratings will affect who can drive the vehicle.  A commercial driver's license (CDL) is required for any vehicle over 26,000 lbs.  If you need to stay under the CDL limit it is necessary to specify the 25,950 GVWR. A.  Stay with current specifications. Q.  Tires.  Current specifications call for 245/75R22.5 tires.	We suggest changing to 255/70R22.5 16-ply tires or 265/75R22.5 14-ply.  The current specification allows for tire weight capacity less than the axles or suspension rating.	Changing to the suggested tires would increase the tire weight capacity to equal or greater than the axles and suspension.  We believe that this is a safer configuration when looking at long term usage and tire wear. A.  Stay with current specifications. Q.  Do you want the emergency valves to be mechanical or air operated? A.  Mechanical Q.  Our tank supplier is not the manufactures the Cardinal. This is a specific name brand. Our tank comes with "jeep" style fenders.  Will you consider this equal to the one specified? A.  Yes, if there is no addition cost Q.  Our tank has side doors at the rear and a main rear canopy door.  How would you prefer your system to be configured, all equipment out the back or face hose reels out the side and the meters out rear canopy door. Or do you want both meters and reels to face out the rear canopy door? A.  Both out the rear door Q.  Do you want any rollers installed on the reels? A.  What we have on the old truck is a hand crank.  So, what ever is going to last the longest either rollers or spring will be fine. Q.  Everything on this unit is carbon steel except for the meters which you are asking for that to be an M-5-A-2 which is aviation grade meter. Do you actually want an aviation grade or a refined fuel grade meter? A.  refined fuel grade Q.  In the SOW in the middle of the filter requirements it states manual drain & air eliminator.  Do you want these components on the filter typically this is part of the meter? A.  if its part of the meters, we don't need it on the filters Q.  There is no mention of bottom loading is all filling of this unit to be accomplished by top filling ? A.  yes Q.   What is the desired flow rate you are looking for? The nozzles you specd are not rated for the same flow of 50 gpm that you specd for the  filters.

The alarm system has automatic monitoring capabilities.  No additional monitoring will be required.  All replacement parts must be purchased by the proprietary supplier "Siemens".  Network: Due to the limitation of straight copper between the facilities and ApC chains are full to capacity, install Multiplexing units as well as port expander units, just to facilitate the system growth throughout the buildings.  By putting the new CCure 800 system on the NIH network all of the hardwired equipment will be able to be removed and change the system into a true-networked Access Control System, expanding the flexibility now and in the future.  The integration with the network will also allow the elimination of the Verizon phone circuits to other buildings (i.e. Warehouse, 6011, etc.), which would eliminate the monthly charge for those circuits.  Modem: This modem offers the NIH two benefits.  (1) It will allow NIH access into the CCure 800/30 machine via phone line if the NIH remote network connectivity is not working. (2) It will allow the Facility Manager capability to dial into the system to perform programming functions and help with programming problems. In addition, it will allow technical support personnel and project manager's ability to dial into the system when a Facility Manager is not available to perform programming changes so NIH personnel can remain secure and protected.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0001 to combined synopsis/solicitation W58RGZ-04-R-0547 for the purpose of providing industry questions and government responses.  The proposal due date has not been changed.  Proposals are due either by email or facsimile no later than 3 May 2004, 4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST).  For those questions/responses that resulted in a change to the requirement, you will need to make a pen and ink change to the original synopsis/solicitation.  Solicitation W58RGZ-04-R-0547 will not b e reprinted in its entirety.  Other questions have been received and will be posted along with the government responses on 26 April 2004.  Due to the immediate need for these aerial surveillance platforms, the cutoff date for submission of industry questio ns is 28 April 2004, 2:00 p.m. CST.  Q1: This solicitation requires a significant amount of effort to produce a compliant proposal, even if a company was aware of the specific requirements of the solicitation.  The response date of 03 May 2004 does not pro vide an offeror sufficient time to do so.  Request that the solicitation due date be changed to 24 May 2004 to provide contractors a reasonable time to respond to the solicitation and remove a possible basis for protests.  A1: With the current hostilities in Iraq, it is imperative that we field this platform as soon as possible.  Allowances have been made so that potential offerors could submit a proposal via email or facsimile.  Because this solicitation is for a commercial off the shelf aircraft purchase,  specifications and price lists should be available for preparation of a proposal within the specified timeframe.  No extension is granted and the due date and time for proposals remains 3 May 2004, 4:00 Central Standard Time.  Q2:  Section 3.5 requires th at the contractor shall deliver new, fully integrated and operational aircraft to Iraq under the following schedule:  two within 30 DAC, two within 90 DAC, etc.  It is unlikely that offerors have new, fully integrated and operational aircraft sitting on th e ramp, when the first time the requirements were made known was when the solicitation was released.  It would take 7-12 days just to ferry aircraft from CONUS to Iraq.  This may raise questions that the outcome of this solicitation has already been determ ined.  Has the outcome of this solicitation already been determine?  If so, recommend that the solicitation be cancelled and reissued as a sole source with appropriate justification.  If not, recommend that the delivery plan be changed to a more realistic schedule of two aircraft 9 months after contract award (MACA), and no more than two aircraft per month thereafter.  This provides a more realistic delivery schedule and removes suspicions that the solicitation outcome has already been determined.  A2: The solicitation outcome has not been pre-determined.  Multiple vendors have indicated interest in this solicitation.  There are no plans to cancel the solicitation and reissue as sole source.  The combined synopsis/solicitation is revised to remove the GO/NO GO evaluation on delivery schedule.  However, the delivery schedule stated in the solicitation is the desired delivery date.  All proposed delivery schedules will be evaluated to determine the best value to the government.  Q3: FAR clause 52.212-2 states t hat the delivery schedule is a GO/NO GO rating, and if all offerors are NO GO then the schedule will be evaluated on best value.  This evaluation criterium may not provide the government with the best value for the overall program.  For example, contractor  A has a best value rating of 100, and is very close to meeting the delivery schedule, but does not.  Contractor B has a best value rating of only 50, but can meet the schedule.  It may be clear to the government that Contractor A provides the best value, however, the government would be forced to award the contract to contractor B.  Replace the GO/NO GO criteria for delivery schedule with best value criteria whi ch would truly provide the best value to the government.    A3: The combined synopsis/solicitation is revised to remove the GO/NO GO evaluation on delivery schedule.  However, the delivery schedule stated in the solicitation is the desired delivery date. All proposed delivery schedules will be evaluated to determine the best value to the government.  Q4: Section 3.2 states that for pilot training, the contractor may assume previous qualified pilot experience.  The section is silent on previous qualificatio ns of the maintenance technicians.  May the contractors assume that the maintenance technicians set for specific aircraft training have previous qualifications equivalent to an FAA A&P license?  If not, what are their previous qualifications?  We need clar ification to properly bid the program.  A4: Previous qualifications are not FAA A&P licensed mechanics.  You can assume these are Iraqi military trained mechanics.  Q5: Section 3.0.5 requires an encoding transponder for ATC identification and for operation s within civil and military ATC infrastructure.  Does the program require a transponder with IFF capability, and if so, what modes?  A5: The system does not require IFF capability.  Q6: Section 3.0.1 requires an aircraft to complete and 8 hour mission in t he environmental conditions expected in Iraq.  It gets very hot in Iraq and 8 hours is a long time to be in a non cooled aircraft.  Even at the surveillance altitudes the ambient temperatures are hot and vent fans would only blow hot air on the crew.  Fati gue and degraded mission effectiveness would be the result.  Include the requirement for an air conditioning system in the aircraft specifications to correct a significant mission effectiveness weakness in the requirements.  A6:  There is no requirement fo r air conditioning in the aircraft.  Q7: Regarding section 3.2, not all pilots and mechanics successfully complete a training course within the prescribed syllabus events and require retraining.  This is especially true when the student qualifications are not well known.  What are the provisions for retraining pilots and mechanics who have failed to successfully complete requirements in the specified time?  Please clarify so that we may properly bid the program.  A7:  No retraining requirement has been iden tified.  It is assumed that the offeror will propose a training plan focusing on success, not failure; therefore a retraining requirement should not occur.  The offeror may submit retraining information as part of their proposed training, if desired.  Q8: The solicitation does not provide the funding level of the program.  Offerors may have several potential aircraft that meet the requirements, some would be more robust and would provide a better value to the government.  However, if the better value aircra ft is outside the available funding, then the offeror would not waste the effort to bid that aircraft.  Please provide the available funding for the program to provide the offerors with the boundary within which to propose their best value solution.  A8: T he funding level of the program will not be stated.  If an offeror has more than one aircraft that can meet the requirements, that offeror can submit separate proposals for each aircraft.  Q9: Section 3.6 requires the contractor to conduct extensive test f lights and the CPA will perform an acceptance check flight prior to delivery of each aircraft.  This type of activity is usually conducted at the manufacturer/modification location where all the support equipment and technical personnel are readily availab le.  The solicitation is silent as to the location of this activity.  Recommend the solicitation state that the contractor functional check flights and CPA acceptance check flight shall be conducted at the contractors facility.  Additionally, the governmen t should take ownership of the aircraft at the contractors facility following the successful completion of the acceptance check flight.  The government may stil l require the contractor to ferry the aircraft to Iraq, however, ownership should transfer after the acceptance, i.e. FOB origin.  Clarify to avoid future misunderstandings.  A9: Test flights may be conducted at the contractors facility.  Delivery of the a ircraft is FOB destination to Basrah International Airport in Iraq as stated in the solicitation.  Q10: As a commercial item being procured under FAR Part 12, the FAR clause 52.232-31, Invitation to Propose Commercial Financing Terms, has not been included  within the solicitation.  Would the government add this clause in order that the contractor may propose his commercial financing terms and align this procurement to commercial industry practices?  A10:  FAR clause 52.232-31 will not be included in this re quirement.  Q11: What is the anticipated contract award date?  A11: If award can be made without holding discussions, the anticipated contract award date is 16 July 2004.  However, if discussions are necessary, the anticipated contract award date is 31 Aug ust 2004.  Q12: Does the government anticipate awarding CLINs 0001 through 0004 simultaneously at contract award?  Clarify for purposes of planning and bidding.  A12: Yes, CLINs 0001 through 0004 will be awarded simultaneously.  Q13: The government has ide ntified CLIN 0001 as eight (8) each aircraft.  With a quantity measurement of each, this implies the government may order one aircraft at a time.  If the government intends to order all 8 aircraft at once, the quantity measurement should reflect LOT.  The government needs to define the quantity measurement desired for CLIN 0001, i.e. EACH or LOT.  If the government intends to order on the basis of a quantity measurement of EACH, this is incompatible with the schedule reflect for the aircraft deliveries.  A1 3: The government has identified the quantity measurement of EACH for CLIN 0001.  As stated in Q&A 12 above, the initial award will include the purchase of 8 aircraft.  The EACH quantity measurement will facilitate payment for each aircraft upon delivery.  Q14: As a commercial item being procured under FAR Part 12, it would be more in compatible with commercial practices if the government modified the requirements of Ã¢Â€Â“in accordance with CDRL XXXX- to Ã¢Â€Â“the CDRL shall be used as a guide.  Modify the  CDRL requirements to reflect they be used as a guide in lieu of in accordance with to align this procurement to commercial practices.  A14: The requirements of the solicitation are changed to allow the CDRLs to be used as a guide.  Contractor formats are acceptable.  Q15: The solicitation requires delivery of CLIN 0001 aircraft to the Basrah International Airport but does not mention the actual permanent beddown location.  For planning and pricing purposes, the governments permanent beddown location should  be provided to the competitors in advance.  Is the Basrah International Airport going to be the permanent beddown site for this proposed acquisition?  A15:  The US Government will not be the operator of the aircraft.  Aircraft beddown base locations are s ubject to change.  There is no requirement for the contractor to be collocated with the beddown base.  Follow-on contractor maintenance is depot only.  Q16: The solicitation requires all aircraft, parts and materials delivered and warranted for a period of  two (2) years beginning on the date of delivery.  It also states that all individual OEM warranties shall be their standard warranty issued IAW best commercial practices and shall pass through to the end user.  Standard OEM parts warranty for this company  is for a period of 6 months from date of delivery.  Does the government want a two-year warranty on parts or the standard OEM warranty?  A16: Government market survey indicates standard OEM warranties are indeed in the two year range.  Basic airframe-2 ye ars; paint-1 year.  Subcomponents, such as radios and navigation equipment, engines, propellers and instruments are based on the OEM warranty.  Q17: We had some  news today that the government might have contracted a different company to produce and deliver the aircrafts specified in this RFP.  Is this true?  Is the new solicitation that was posted for this tender open and alive and you are expecting bids for this  work by May 3rd?  A17: The solicitation is open and valid.  No contract has been awarded for these aircraft.  Proposals for this requirement are due May 3, 2004, 4:00 p.m. central standard time.  Q18: Would airplanes or helicopters be more useful for you here?  A18:  This requirement is for a fixed wing aircraft.  Q19: Who will be handling the export of the A/C and sensors?  The 30 day delivery for the first 2 will not even allow enough time to get an expedited export license.  If the US Army is doing it t hen no export license will be required.  A19: The US Government will handle any export contingencies as necessary.  Q20: I assume that you are aware that the recognition distance for the IR sensor will require a fairly high performance system which also ge ts into the export license issue.  Are there any restrictions as to what will be considered for export and what will not?  A20: There are no restrictions with which the bidder should be concerned.  The US Government will handle any export contingencies as necessary.  Q21: Section 3.0.2 requires commercial fuel (MOGAS 80-87 octane).  Will the army accept turbine powered aircraft?  A21:  No.  Q22:  Paragraph 2.0 Applicable Document.  This paragraph reflects the requirement for FAA FAR Part 23 Airworthiness St andards.  As this will be a government user is Military Certification sufficient to satisfy this solicitation?  A22: No.  It must be certified as per FAA FAR Part 23 for the purpose of adhering to Acquisition regulations. Q23:  Also in Paragraph 2.0, there  is a cryptic reference to FAA FAR Part 121 Operating Requirements.  What specifically does that mean?  Most such operations are conducted under Part 121 Operating and Flight Rules.  Part 121 mostly refers to air carrier operations.  A23: This FAA FAR Part  was included so as to ensure that the aircraft adheres to regulations as they pertain to construction, safety and maintenance, e.g. to include such things as, but not limited to, 121.235 Fuel Valves, 121.237 Oil lines and fittings in designated fire zones , 121.239 Oil valves, etc.  Q24:  Paragraph 3.0.2 Requirements.  Please clarify the statement that aircraft should be approved for operation in day/night VMC and be capable of operations in IMC.  Does this mean that the aircraft does not require IMC certif ication?  A24: The aircraft must be certified for IFR (IMC).  It need not be certified for icing conditions.  Q25: Also in Paragraph 3.0.2.  Solicitation reflects that aircraft shall require only commercial fuels (MOGAS 80-87 octane).  Are other commercial  fuels, such as AVGAS 100 low lead or Jet A fuel acceptable?  A25: No.  Q26: Paragraph 3.2 Maintenance Training.  (Contractor) has considerable experience in training foreign maintenance personnel.  Has any assessment been done of the skill levels of Iraqi  maintenance personnel?   International aircraft maintenance skills seldom come up to FAA standards without extensive training and follow-on maintenance supervision.  We do not see a reference in the solicitation to a requirement for ongoing skills develop ment by qualified supervisory maintenance personnel.  A26: Previous qualifications ARE NOT FAA A&P licensed mechanics.   Assume Iraqi military trained mechanics.  No retraining requirement has been identified.  You may propose ongoing training if desired.  Q27: Paragraph 3.3 Pilot Training.  This same question should be asked regarding assessment of Iraqi pilot skills.  Can they be expected to have night and instrument flight experience and IFR ratings?  A27: Assume Iraqi military trained fixed-wing pilots.   No retraining requirement has been identified.  You may propose ongoing training if desired.  Q28: Paragraph 3.5 Aircraft Delivery Plan.   The aircraft delive ry plan seems very aggressive, particularly given uncertainties about the skills.  A28: The combined synopsis/solicitation is revised to remove the GO/NO GO evaluation on delivery schedule.  However, the delivery schedule stated in the solicitation is the desired delivery date.  All proposed delivery schedules will be evaluated to determine the best value to the government.  Q29: There is no reference in the solicitation to the identity of the sponsoring agency.  What is the entity?  Is it possible to meet with that agency to more fully discuss the requirement and to define the full range of capabilities of (the contractors) reconnaissance aircraft?  We would like to do so at the earliest opportunity.  A29:  The US Army Aviation and Missile Command is the co ntracting agency for this requirement in support of the Coalition Provisional Authority.  This is a competitive acquisition and meetings with potential offerors will not be allowed.  Q30: There is no mention in the solicitation of provision of and training  in the use of NVG equipment.  Also, there is no mention of making aircraft panels compatible with NVG use.  Are NVGs a requirement and is it required to have NVG panels in the aircraft?  A30: There are no NVG requirements.  Q31:  There is no mention of ty pes of sensor displays for the imaging system.  Are there specific requirements, e.g., night vision capability and/or resolution requirements for displays? A31: Displays must be visible in a dark environment, due to the 24/7 Day/Night requirement.  Paragraph 3.0.3 addresses the type of sensor suite requirement.
