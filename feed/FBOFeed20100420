Support activity for the DM CODB is located at 4170 Hebble Creek Road, Bldg 280, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5635.  The primary purpose of the DM CODB is to consolidate and provide data for the production management of the Depot repair and maintenance process for the Air Force Enterprise.  It is an operational-level data environment, serving on-line transaction processing applications for managing day-to-day operations in the Air Force aircraft maintenance depots.  The DM CODB provides corporate-level data to support AFMC tactical and strategic planning activities.  As operational applications are technically refreshed, they are enhanced with new user capabilities for reporting and on-line analytical processing (OLAP).  Drawing upon the DM CODB's consolidated data, these systems enable users to extract information, perform analyses, create reports, and respond to information requests from AFMC command-level staff, HQ Air Force staff, and Department of Defense (DoD) element! s.  The DM CODB also provides data for similar purposes to the Air Force Global Combat Support System Data Services (GCSS-AF DS), and to other data marts / warehouses and Enterprise Integration projects.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions & Lethality Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of PM Soldier Weapons, intends to solicit, negotiate and award a sole source contract to Kongsberg Defence Aerospace under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i).  The anticipated effort is to modify the unique embedded software to accommodate the newly upgraded RG-33A1SV vehicle (SOCOM upgrade to the RG-33SV vehicles).  Kongsberg Defence Aerospace has developed and owns the source code for the M151E2 Remote Weapons Station Software.  Kongsberg Defence Aerospace is the only company that can modify their software which will include vehicle identification and safety inhibits for the RG-33A1SV.  Kongsberg Defence Aerospace possesses the technical data rights to all of the system components and their interfaces.  The additional expenses and delays to have another contractor gain the detailed understanding and rights necessary to perform the modification to the embedded software is considered to be unacceptable.
  
In order to continue combat operations, SOCOM requires a rapid upgrade to the Remote Weapons Station software to accommodate their newly upgraded vehicle, the RG-33A1SV. Once completed, SOCOM can use the M151E2 on the RG-33A1SV in combat operations.  Please note this notice does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   The anticipated award date for this action is the 4th of May 2010.

<a href="mailto:KRISTINA.WEIR@VA.GOV">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Louis A Johnson Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) Clarksburg, WV, is soliciting and intends to award a firm fixed price contract for Architecture/Engineering (A&E) services entitled, "A&E HVAC Renovations" at the VAMC in Clarksburg, WV. Only firms within 250 miles (or with branches within 250 miles) of the Louis. A. Johnson VAMC will be considered for award of this contract. The estimated construction cost range is between $250,000 and $500,000. Negotiations will be conducted for hourly rates for each discipline required, overhead, profit and other cost elements, which are particular to the contract.Full and open competition will be utilized. The NAICS Code is 541310, Architectural Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $4.50 million gross annual revenue. It is the intention of the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center (VAMC) to acquire a comprehensive range of professional architectural, engineering and ancillary professional services in support of the VAMC HVAC Systems. Provision of a wide range of professional services and specialties including Laboratory Testing by disciplines will be required including the following: Architecture, Architectural Project Management Support (CPM and related scheduling and planning services), Structural Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Plumbing Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering, Ground/Floor Penetration Surveys, Fire Safety Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Energy Engineering Computer Aided Facility Management Support		Provision of design services for this project are based on a recent study and evaluation of the air handlers at this facility. It is to be noted that the intention of the VA is to acquire design(s) of corrective actions which will require extensive investigation by the A/E beyond the document provided. There are a number of elements to performing under the anticipated contract that are unique to the VA as contrasted to the private sector and to other federal agencies.The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is its own Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). As a Federal Agency, the Designated Agency Safety and Health Officer (DASHO) is tasked with responsibility for all National Fire Codes etc.The VA maintains its own set of mandatory design manuals, master specifications, CAD Details and Standards and extensive submission requirements for A/E services. These are found at www.cfm.va.gov/ . In many areas these design standards exceed that of national consensus codes. This is particularly true for electrical, steam generation/distribution and architectural accessibility design requirements. A/E firms act in advisory capacity to the VAMC not in the role of agent as is often the case in the private sector. This results in the construction period services such as submittal review (which are funneled through the VA to the contractor) requiring additional time to fully process.The programming and schematic review period will require 30 to 45 days review and approval time by the VA. 50% and 90% Submissions in the Design Development Phase are reviewed by an external Fire Safety engineer adding one or more weeks to the VA review periods. Also in house reviews and coordination with owning departments and stake holders require two or more weeks for the VA to process for any submission. The A/E will provide 8 sets of documents for each.		Construction Safety Guidance requires additional and extensive in house review of each submission by VA staff. This is intended to occur immediately after receipt of the external report at D for the 50% and 90% set. The A/E will be required to incorporate all changes resulting from such reviews at no additional cost to the government.Interested A/E firms must submit the following additional information on Part H of the SF-330: 1. PROPOSED MANAGEMENT PLAN: Provide a narrative description of your proposed management plan for conceptual design, design phases, and the construction phase for the identified requirements. 2. PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OF PROPOSED TEAM: Describe project experience for the above identified projects and experience with healthcare facilities. Describe the team's experiences with issues unique to healthcare facilities. Address experience with the design and modifications of occupied facilities, development of conceptual designs, cost estimates and VA master specifications. VA master specifications are viewable online at http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/spec.asp. 3. PROPOSED APPROACH FOR HANDLING IDIQ FOR DESIGN: Describe proposed design philosophy. Address how your A/E firm will handle anticipated problems and potential solutions. 4. PROJECT CONTROL: Describe techniques planned to control (a) project management, (b) schedule, (c) quality and (d) costs. Describe the personnel responsible for these areas, including the project manager, and consultants. 5. ESTIMATING EFFECTIVENESS: Provide the estimates for the relevant projects that were listed in Part 19 of the SF 330, identifying the initial A/E construction budget, bid price of project, amount of change orders and percent of changes for the various major divisions (architectural, mechanical, electrical, structural, and civil). 6. SUSTAINABLE DESIGN: Describe your teams design philosophy, method and experience of implementing and controlling. 7. MISCELLANEOUS EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES: Address experiences from the projects listed in Part 19 of the SF 330 in regards to: (a) CADD and other computer applications; (b) value engineering; (c) life cycle cost analyses; (d) environmental; (e) historic preservation; (f) energy conservation; (g) new energy resources; and (h) Critical Path Management (CPM) and fast track construction. 8. INSURANCE AND LITIGATION: Address the types and amounts of liability insurance carried. Identify any and all litigation involvement over the last five years and its outcomes.This is not a request for proposal.  Interested firms should submit two (2) completed SF 330s (form available at http://vaww.va.gov/facmgt/ae).  A&E Firms are required to respond via email to Kristina.Weir@VA.Gov or mail to Louis A. Johnson VAMC, One Med Center Dr., Clarksburg, WV  26301, Attn: Kristina Weir, by 4:00 p.m. local time on or before May 19, 2010.

<DESC>This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.2.4.  It is a survey, not a solicitation, to determine interest and capabilities of interested Small Businesses in providing support services to the Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS) located at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC).  This system tracks, anticipates and manages the flow of air traffic throughout U.S. airspace, integrating real-time weather and flight data from multiple sources. The upgraded TFMS helps traffic management specialists predict, on national and local scales, traffic surges, gaps, and volume based on current and anticipated airborne aircraft.  Traffic Management Specialists evaluate the projected flow of traffic into airports, sectors, and fixes, and then implement the least restrictive action necessary to ensure that traffic demand does not exceed system capacity.  The WJHTC, AJP-78B Traffic Flow Management Production Center Team supports the operations, engineering, development, test, deployment, and maintenance of TFMS and other FAA Command Center Systems.The TFMS provides the functionality and architecture needed to take the FAA into NextGen, and paves the way for improved traffic management technologies. The modernized TFMS uses a state-of-the-art, open-architecture platform that increases development bandwidth, facilitates integration with other domains, and improves TFM performance and capacity. The new system will be able to expand to accommodate the anticipated growth in traffic in coming years.A predecessor contract, # DTFA03-01-D-00007, Delivery Order #7 was awarded to Lockheed Martin Corporation, a large business. This market survey is being conducted to aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside the work for small business.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.The North American Industry Code Standard for the work contemplated is 541330, Engineering Services and the size standard is $27 million.
The prospective contractor must support the following:	Provide 24 X 7 support for Traffic Flow Management operations at the WJHTC	Provide 1st level telephone support for operational Traffic Flow Management products	Support 2nd level maintenance and upgrade of Traffic Flow Management products troubleshooting difficult problems involving the hardware, operating system and application hardware	Support site surveys, installation, and integration of new or upgraded Traffic Flow management products	Develop test and operational toolsets	Develop test documentation, including test plans, procedures and reports
A draft Statement of Work for TFMS Operational Support and Maintenance is attached.  The FAA has a need for these requirements for the next 5 years.  
Interested companies are required to provide:
	Completed Business Declaration Form, Attached	If claiming any special status, such as an SEDB/8(a) firm, include copy of letter from Small Business Administration.	If services are available on GSA schedule or any other Government contract vehicle, provide e-brochure or link to this information. 	A two-page summary of previous experience and expertise with Traffic Flow Management to include, at a minimum, start & end dates of work, name of organization, name and phone number of point of contact familiar with contractor's work on the project, dollar value, brief description of the work and role that the contractor playedprime or subcontractorin accomplishing the project.
The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation and submittal of responses to this announcement.  Brochures alone will not be considered sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities.  Responses will not be returned.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and will not result in a contract award.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  This is a sources sought announcement so NO solicitation exists; please do not request one.  If a solicitation is issued, it will be synopsized on the FAA's contract opportunities web page and it is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor this site for release.  If a determination to set this requirement aside for small business, failure to respond to this announcement may result in exclusion of offeror from competition since the solicitation may be released to qualified, responding small businesses.  

Questions pertaining to this announcement must be submitted via e-mail by April 29, 2010.  Submissions of Past Experience statements are due by 2pm EST Tuesday May 8, 2010 via e-mail to kimberly.a.knight@faal.gov.

 Produce cultural resources reports which include National Register of Historic Places
eligibility recommendations.
 A prospective contractor may bid on the work items listed for one, or more, of the
Ranger Districts (Dolores, Columbine and Pagosa) listed in the Schedule of Items.
However, due to the need to complete all of the cultural resource surveys as
expediently as possible, cultural survey crews will need to be surveying and
completing reports in all three Ranger Districts concurrently. Work will need to
start in all three Districts as soon as the snow melts, approximately June 15, 2010.
The project area is located within the San Juan National Forest. Standards for the survey are
specified in Division 200.

The Trails, and Facilities maintenance and improvement projects are located on
numerous trails and facilities within the San Juan National Forest, see the attached lists of San Juan Trail Projects. The San Juan National Forest has several Southwest Conservation
Corp trail crews under contract ready to start the trail improvement work as soon as the snow melts, so it will be imperitive to have the cultural surveys done as quickly as possible so as not to delay the trail crews. This project contains three separate bid items: A contract for trails and facilities cultural resource survey and cultural resource monitoring in the Dolores Ranger District; a contract for trails and facilities cultural resource survey and cultural resource monitoring in the Columbine Ranger District; and a contract for trails and facilities cultural resource survey and cultural resource monitoring in the Pagosa Ranger District. A prospective contractor may bid on the work items listed for one, or more, of the Ranger Districts.

Trails with slopes less than 35% will have intensive Class III surveys conducted with a corridor width of 100 ft. (30 meters), trails with slopes greater than 35% will have Class II reconassonce survey conducted. It is anticipated that several of these trails are historic trails and will be documented as such on official Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation Site Forms.  

THERE IS NOT A PREBID/TOUR SCHEDULED FOR THIS EFFORT; FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT JULIE COLEMAN AT 970-385-1250.

All responsible sources may submit a bid which will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent of the US Forest Service, Chugach National Forest, in Alaska, to negotiate a follow-on modification with Alaska Geographic, 810 E 9th Avenue, Anchorage AK 99501.  The original requirement was synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities under AG-0120-S-09-0046, before purchase order, AG-0120-P-09-0057, was awarded on 28 May 2009 for $25,000.   Services provided in the original scope of work included:  the collection, editing and integration of content focused on Exxon Valdez oil spill researchers and community leaders in recovery efforts, stories of their work and related resources and services for a web-based, interpretive geotourism-like map-guide of Prince William Sound.  Alaska Geographic co-sponsored the initial development and design of the Prince William Sound map-guide web portal.  Purchase order AG-0120-P-09-0057 was issued as a continuation of that initial web-portal development.  

Services required under the modification include:  Providing expertise and labor toward the enhancement of the Sound Stories website in four ways 1) increase the interactivity and functionality of the current website 2) the development of community resources to boost local story submissions and 3) draft a design of a paper map companion piece that compliments the website; and assuming funds are forthcoming 4) consultation, production and editing in preparation for final paper map printing through the USFS.  The first two components were identified as a need based on initial reviews of website function and a comprehensive review of story content that was recently completed.  The remaining components pertain to the creation of a companion paper map piece.  The details of the map compilation recently came out of discussions with Alaska Geographic.  The resulting paper map must be integrated in form, appearance, and content with the Sound Stories website that is being published and hosted by Alaska Geographic.  The work and the award will occur in two phases with an initial award of $34,500, and, if funding becomes available, an additional $14,000 award to take the map through production.  Alaska Geographic is the interpretive association for the US Forest Service and they are uniquely qualified to assist the Forest Service in supporting interpretation and education on the Chugach National Forest.   

Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and a package is not available.  However, all capability statements received within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  It will be within the governments discretion not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon the responses to this notice.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO THE CONTRACTOR UNDER CONTRACT NO. AG-3A75-C-09-0019

RECOVERY - The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is seeking proposal for A&E Services under Contract Number AG-3A75-C-09-0019.  A Task Order will be issued to HDR Engineering, Inc. for independent design review of an ARRA Rehabilitation project in the state of Massachusetts located at Nichols Dam Rehabilitation.  The NAICS Code for this Task Order is 541330, and the size standard is $4.5 million.  Design review with detail cost proposal from HDR Engineering, Inc. is due no later than close of business on April 26, 2010.  Negotiation procedures will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6.

The Contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described herein:

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDANatural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard.  The Contractor shall assume responsibility, along with the designer, for the functional adequacy and structural soundness of the design, except in those instances where the contractors recommendations are not incorporated into the final design.  The Contractors capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to ensure that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall ensure that the design:  1) addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies, 2) safely and effectively meets the stated objectives, 3) addresses unique site conditions, 4) Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures, and 5) Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure two (2) Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) pads of Helipad 3D from Heusker Inc. in support of Operation Iraq Freedom (OIF) and the ramp up of efforts in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The dry and dusty environments create havoc for a helicopter pilot during landings and takeoffs.  Pilots easily lose visual reference as the sand and dirt are kicked up and engulf the aircraft.  This occurrence, which often results in aircraft and crewmember loss, is referred to as a brownout.  Brownouts are commonplace for pilots landing to a Landing Zone (LZ) site without lightweight mat pad.  It is the lightweight mat that suppresses the dirt and dust while still allowing the pilot to operate in a safe condition.  An RFI  was synopsized on 23 June 2009 under N68335-09-RFI-7101.  Five responses were received.  Heusker Inc. was the only firm who supplied a sample mat that passed the testing.  Small product samples were submitted with the RFI.  Now a larger VTOL pad is needed to conduct further testing.  The Government intends to procure these items under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (3) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3.

The work includes, but is not limited to labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to perform new construction, repair, alteration, and related demolition of existing infrastructure based on Design-Build or Design-Bid-Build (full plans and specifications) for infrastructure within the State of Hawaii.  "Infrastructure" is defined as 1) residential building construction; 2) construction for industrial buildings and warehouses; 3) nonresidential buildings, other than industrial buildings and warehouses; and 4) improvements such as utilities, airfields, and roadways.  The areas of consideration will include, but not limited to, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and miscellaneous Federal and other facilities.  Task Orders will be issued for the work that will require design and construction services.  In support of design-build work, the Contractor shall employ the services of an architect/engineering professional experienced in the coordination of multi-disciplined architectural/engineering design efforts in all aspects of general building and new and renovation projects.  The scope of work will not include the more highly specialized waterfront projects.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220 and the annual size standard is $33.5 million.  
The proposed contract is limited to qualifying 8(a) firms in the Hawaii District Office (HDO) of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).  The Government will not consider offers from other 8(a) firms or from 8(a) firms outside of the HDO.  8(a) firms that are not serviced by the HDO, but have a bona fide place of business (as defined by SBA) within the geographic area served by the HDO are also eligible to submit offers.  An 8(a) firm not serviced by the HDO must consult its servicing District Office regarding the establishment of a bona fide place of business or status of a previously established bona fide place of business.  All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers.
This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent of awarding a minimum of two (2) Firm Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the procurement if only one proposal is received that offers the best value to the Government.
The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures, which require Offerors to submit a technical and price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  The Government will require pricing for the Seed Project for the price proposal.  The Seed Project may or may not be awarded as a task order.   The technical factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than price.  The anticipated technical factors are:  FACTOR 1: Past Performance of the Construction Contractor and Lead Design Firm; FACTOR 2: Experience and Qualifications of the Construction Contractor's Key Personnel and Lead Design Firm; FACTOR 3: Management Plan for the Contract; FACTOR 4: Work Plan and Schedule for the Seed Project.   
The minimum guarantee for the base period only will be $10,000.  The minimum guarantee may be met by the issuance of a task order during the base period or option period(s).  The resultant contract will contain provisions for a base period of 12-months and four (4) 12-month option periods.  The total value for all contracts inclusive of options will not exceed $500,000,000.  The total term of the contract, including all options, will not exceed 60 months.  Solicitation issue and receipt dates are approximate.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross revenue, taken for the last 3 fiscal years, does not exceed $33.5 Million.<BR><BR>IMPORTANT NOTICE: All contractors proposing on Department of Defense Solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of the contract.

<a href="mailto:bethanie.f.healey@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Seattle</a>
<DESC>The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a competitive HUBZone small business set-aside requirement for a $20M Job Order Contract (JOC) requiring multi-disciplinary maintenance, repair and minor construction work, with most task orders ranging from $2,000 to $750,000, and with a maximum limit of Not-to-Exceed (NTE) $2,000,000 per task order.  The JOC will be used as an alternative to other contractual procedures for projects under $2,000,000.  More specifically, the JOC will be used for less complex projects, enabling the Government to avoid separate iterative design and construction solicitation efforts, and thus achieving design cost and manpower savings for comparatively simple design and low/moderate dollar value projects.  It is anticipated that work will include some minor road repairs, projects that require open space improvements, renovation of facilities, range upgrades, minor new construction, carpentry, roofing, excavation, interior/exterior elements, steam fitting, HVAC, plumbing, sheet metal, painting, fencing, demolition, concrete, masonry, asbestos and lead paint abatement incidental to construction, and minor project design.  This HUBZone Small Business JOC will support Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) and its sub-installations as well as other customers supported by the Seattle District Corps of Engineers within the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.<BR><BR>The solicitation for this requirement will be a HUBZone small business set-aside and will be issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) using trade-off source selection procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.  A firm-fixed-price contract will be negotiated as a result of this procurement.   The performance period under this JOC will include a one-year base period, with the option to extend for four (4) additional one-year option periods, for a total contract period Not-to-Exceed (NTE) five (5) years.  The maximum value of all work issued under this JOC shall be limited to $20 Million over the life of the contract.  <BR><BR>The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a small business size standard of $33.5 Million.  As a HUBZone Small Business Set-Aside, the solicitation for this requirement will be open to all eligible HUBZone small business concerns.  For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross revenue, taken for the last 3 fiscal years, does not exceed $33.5 Million. <BR><BR>IMPORTANT NOTICE: All contractors proposing on Department of Defense Solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of the contract. The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information and capabilities to the Government. The CCR website can be accessed at www.ccr.gov. You are encouraged to register as soon as possible. All new contracts can ONLY be made to contractors who are registered in CCR. This requirement applies to all Department of Defense contract awards, regardless of the media used.<BR><BR>The solicitation documents for this JOC requirement will be issued in electronic format only and will be made available online on or about 4 May 2010 via FedBizOpps.gov at https://www.fbo.gov/ under solicitation number W912DW-10-R-0040.

The intestinal microflora of the requested animals must be similar to that of the intestinal bacterial microflora of mice already used in the research effort. The purchase of these mice will allow for the continuation of biomedical research with this animal strain.

Responses to the CD2F1 strain of mice, from Harlan Laboratories, Inc., have already been established.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability of non-profit organizations to provide services to eligible individuals, beginning in 2010 and ending December 31, 2013, under a temporary high risk health insurance pool program established in section 1101 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act), Public Law 111-148. The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify non-profit organizations that would be available to contract with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to operate high risk pool programs consistent with the Affordable Care Act in any states that do not submit an acceptable application to administer the high risk coverage program. HHS anticipates contracting with states (or designated state high risk pools) that submit an acceptable application to operate a high risk pool program. However, in the event that a state (or its designated state high risk pool) does not submit an acceptable application to operate a high risk pool program consistent with section 1101 of the Affordable Care Act, HHS intends to administer the program directly or contract with a non-profit private entity or entities to provide coverage in such states. <br />On April 2, 2010, the Secretary issued a letter to governors and state insurance commissioners (sample letter attached) asking each state to express its interest in participating in the temporary high risk pool program established by the Affordable Care Act. That letter outlines several options for states to participate in developing and operating high risk pools under this program. HHS anticipates learning from states by April 30, 2010 as to whether they will operate such a high risk pool program. Subsequently, HHS may solicit and evaluate bids from non-profit private organizations to operate high risk pools in any states that elect not to contract with HHS for purposes of implementing this program. HHS anticipates that it may contract with one or more non-profit organizations to begin operating high risk pools in those states as early as July, 2010.
<p>Due to the urgent need to begin operation of this program, HHS is using this Sources Sought Notice to identify potential contractors before knowing in which states, if any, HHS will need to administer the high risk pool program directly or contract with a non-profit private organization(s) to administer such programs. In order to respond to this notice, potential contractors must be non-profit private organizations and be able to demonstrate the following capabilities:</p>
<p>1. The ability to provide a full range of third-party administrator services in the operation of a temporary high risk insurance program consistent with section 1101 of the Affordable Care Act, providing services that include:</p>
<p>a. Claims processing, including health care claims and point of sale prescription drug claims;</p>
<p>b. Provision of contracted health care provider and pharmacy networks;</p>
<p>c. Utilization review;</p>
<p>d. Appeals processes;</p>
<p>e. Eligibility determinations and enrollment/disenrollment functions ;</p>
<p>f. Full range of member and provider relations services, including call center and website management;</p>
<p>g. Plan marketing; and</p>
<p>h. Collection of premiums.</p>
<p>2. The ability to have in place a provider network capable of providing a full range of high quality and accessible health care to high risk pool members throughout the state(s) to be covered by the potential contractor .</p>
<p>3. The capacity to begin all third-party administrator functions promptly after the award of contract for all states identified in the contract.</p>
<p>4. The capacity to provide membership, claims, and utilization data as may be required by HHS, including the capacity to establish the accounting and funds controls needed to permit timely tracking of claims payments under each state's high risk insurance program.</p>
<p>5. The capacity to monitor and report to HHS and state authorities information related to misconduct that takes place in the marketplace, including allegations relating to health insurance issuers and employment-based health plans discouraging individuals from remaining enrolled in prior coverage based on an individual's health status, as well as allegations related to fraud and abuse within the high risk pool program.</p>
<p>Please include the following in your response:</p>
<p>A capability statement that addresses each of the elements identified above, including a list of states where the potential contractor could offer the services described above.</p>
<p>Business information -Company Point of Contact, Phone, and Email address</p>
<p>Teaming Arrangements: All teaming arrangements shall also include the above-cited information and certifications for each entity on the proposed team. (Note that potential subcontractors are not necessarily required to be nonprofit entities.)</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted not later than May 4, 2010. Responses may be submitted electronically to Kevin Simpson (kevin.simpson@cms.hhs.gov) or Linda Anders (linda.anders@cms.hhs.gov) or mailed to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 7500 Security Blvd, Baltimore, MD 21244-1850, Mail Stop C2-12-16 ATTN: Kevin Simpson. The maximum number of pages for submission is 10 pages.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this Notice. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Notice. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this evaluation. Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date.</p>

<DESC>1. SUBJECT: The Air Force Medical Support Activity (AFMSA) is conducting market research for a technology solution for an online Internet based personal health record (PHR).
<p>2. DISCLAIMER: This is not a request for proposals or a request for quotations; it is strictly a Request for Information (RFI) only. Neither, unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. No contract will be awarded pursuant to this RFI.</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND: The Assistant Surgeon General for Modernization, Office of Air Force Surgeon General (AFMSA/CC) has identified a need for an online Internet based PHR. These tools, usually available through the internet, can help people track their health care services and better communicate with their providers. The type of Personal Health Records AFMSA is envisioning are populated with health information from existing data warehouse managed and controlled by AFMSA. In the future, these records may be able to get information from a provider's electronic health record system, and some provider's may begin to allow patients to see the information directly from those electronic records. In general, a Personal Health Record (PHR) is controlled by the individual, and can be shared with others, including caregivers, family members and providers. This is different from a provider's electronic health record, which is controlled by the provider just as paper medical records are today. Ideally, a Personal Health Record will have a fairly complete summary of an individual's health and medical history based on data from many sources, including information entered by the individual (allergies, over the counter medications, family history, etc). Today, Personal Health Records are available from a number of sources: by many health plans for their members, by providers for their patients, and by independent vendors who are given permission by the individual to receive and store information from health plans, providers, pharmacies, labs, etc.</p>
<p>4. AFMSA vision is to implement PHR web services that allow customization from an existing product/service being used today from a vendor who has already penetrated the market and can be regarded as an industry leader with proven PHR performance/case studies. Included in this vision is to allow electronic health devices such as blood pressure monitors, pedometers, glucometers, and others to gather valuable information stored in one centrally, and then use it with tools that help individuals track health progress and manage fitness goals.</p>
<p>5. MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:<br />&bull; Vendor must have an existing web service PHR product/service and be considered an industry leader<br />&bull; Vendor must have a software development kit (SDK) to allow customization of the a PHR presence and allow an automated data feed from AFMSA and/or DOD health data sources using approved data transfer protocols compliant to all privacy guidelines.<br />&bull; PHR product/service must currently allow the seamless connection and automated data delivery via external home use bio medical devices such as wireless glucometers, weight scales, blood pressure devices, etc. <br />&bull; Vendor must have growing partnerships with other healthcare related entities as an additional information offering, establishing a seamless online healthcare community of interest.</p>
<p>6. RESPONSE SUBMISSION AND CONTACT INFORMATION: ELECTRONIC RESPONSES: Electronic responses to this RFI must be addressed to Mr. Rodney D. Aytch via e-mail to: rodney.aytch.ctr@afncr.af.mil and and carbon copy Mrs. Susan T. Starks, susan.starks@afncr.af.mil. For technical questions please contact Major William E. Sorrells via e-mail to: william.sorrells@pentagon.af.mil. Responses must be received by this office on or before 4:00 p.m. 4 May 2010. This RFI is not a commercial solicitation. The Government will not pay or any information submitted, or for any costs associated with providing the information.</p>
<p>7. RELEASE OF CLAIMS, LIABILITY, AND PREPRATION EXPENSES:<br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI marked as "proprietary" will be handled accordingly.

The U.S. Department of Labor is seeking qualified contractors to conduct random assignment evaluations of the impacts on participants post-program employment and education outcomes of training provided under Young Parents Demonstration (YPD) grants awarded with Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Pilot, Demonstration and Research funds.  This is a new demonstration program of competitive grants to address the employment and training needs of young parents.

YPDs impacts will be evaluated in two separate evaluations requiring the same qualifications of the contractor.  Six grants, awarded June 2009, comprise Round I; seven additional grants awarded in July 2009 comprise  Round II; three to four additional grants will be awarded in Program Year 2010 (Round III).  Rounds I and II will be the subject of one impact evaluation; round III will be the subject of a separate process and impact evaluation.  The solicitation for Rounds I and II grants can be found at http://www.doleta.gov/grants/pdf/SGA_DFA_PY0808.pdf. To qualify as a bidder, contractors must show they are capable of performing at least one of the evaluations.  The evaluations will track the study samples for three years from the point of random assignment.

When submitting your response, please indicate under which programs you meet the criteria.  The NAICS Code is 541611, and the Small Business Standard is $7 million.  The contractor will be responsible for estimating the impacts of the training provided by the grantees on participants post-program earning, employment and certification outcomes, overall and for key subgroups.  Activities undertaken as part of this contract include, but are not limited to, developing evaluation design reports, collecting and analyzing data (including administering a large-scale survey), convening meetings, and providing briefings to executive-level federal staff.  The contractor must be able to design an appropriate, rigorous, and feasible random assignment impact evaluation design; execute the evaluation; and prepare reports based on the data analysis.

To protect the Roots Blower, the Sequence of Operation requires that a lubricating oil pump be started first.  The VFD must be programmed to that it cannot start the motor until the oil pressure is at a minimum of 40 psig.
 Prior to Final Acceptance of the installation the system shall be commissioned to verify:
1)  That the motor will not start until the oil pressure is at a minimum of 40 psig;
2)  That the VFD is controlling the motor speed.
3)  That the required back pressures for running spark arrester tests can be achieved at the necessary operating speed from 0 to 1780 rpms.

RequirementsNSWCDD seeks a vendor to provide GPS receivers suitable for use as an embedded navigator in an 81 millimeter (mm) mortar in a technology demonstration program. As a technology demonstration, some of the ultimate military tactical requirements may be waived for expediency or convenience. Figure 1 attached identifies the critical parameters for this effort, with "threshold" designating the minimum acceptable performance of the receivers to be purchased and "objective" designating the expected performance in the final tactical implementation. The attached Requirements table (Figure 1) includes the list of minimum requirements, and the objective requirements. The Vendor Specifications table (Figure 2) will need to be completed by the vendor.
SizeThe objective design "space claim" is for a 40 mm diameter circuit board, with height depending on whether or not anti-jam protection is included (single versus two board stack). For the threshold requirement, any receiver which fits within a 60 mm diameter circle is preferred. However, any form factor with a minimum dimension of 60 mm will be considered.
ShockThis receiver is intended for use in an 81 mm mortar application. The mortar is explosively propelled from the launch tube and experiences a severe "setback" environment of 10,000 - 20,000 Gs for a brief duration (approx 10 milliseconds). After launch, the accelerations are small due to the modest control surfaces acting to guide the round to the target.
Note: maximum height and velocity during the technology demonstration are expected to be below the COCOM (Combatant Command) export restrictions for commercial receivers of 18 km and 515 m/sec.
Time to Usable Navigation (TTUN)The "time to usable navigation" is defined as the maximum expected time between application of valid power and output of navigation data within specified accuracy.
For the technology demonstration it is expected that the GPS receiver will be powered and navigating prior to launch. It is not a requirement to navigate through the launch event (acceleration is extreme and antennas will be briefly masked (for less than 1 second)). In the tactical use, the mortar (and receiver) will be provided with initialization data consisting of satellite broadcast data, cryptographic keys, time of day and a 10 pulse per second frequency reference for oscillator calibration. Initialization will be maintained in data hold for up to five minutes prior to launch.
Other considerations It is beneficial to the 81mm mortar effort if a path from technology demonstration to objective tactical use is defined. For that reason, secondary consideration will be given to receivers that currently have or are planned to have the following: L2 capability, P(Y) capability, M-Code capability, Direction Finding capability, Uplink capability, trajectory aiding capability, anti-jam protection, severe electromagnetic environment survivability, dedicated onboard processor for user apps (preferably compatible with commercially available support tools), output of pre-PVT (Position, Velocity, Time) data (e.g. pseudo range).
Peripheral SupportAdditional consideration will be given to vendors who provide documentation of peripheral support in the following areas:
.	Vendor has unique software capabilities and functions 
.	Vendor can supply developed interface and diagnostic software 
.	Vendor can supply a user interface kit
.	Vendor can supply user and technical manuals
.	Vendor can supply technical assistance to aid in the integration of the vendor's receivers into specific test platforms.
The vendor shall complete the Vendor Specifications table attached, provide a rough estimate of the cost per unit, delivery time after receipt of order, provide legacy/history of the product (i.e. product maturity and uses on other programs, if applicable), and if a COTS item - the part number. The expression of interest shall adhered to a five (5) page submission limit, plus any commercial marketing information, brochures, or web links. This market research announcement is not considered a commitment of any kind by the Government and individual correspondence should not be expected in advance of any resulting pre-solicitation notice for proposal requirements.

Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>Services required are as follows:<BR>" Portable<BR>" Test Protocols: LOS and mCTSIB<BR>" Device must be able to test several different conditions<BR>" Device must provide ordinal (number) scores of performance<BR>" Device must correlate with other (fixed) devices already in use at military medical centers<BR>" Device must have a small footprint<BR>" NeuroCom Computerized Dynamic Posturography Device Compatibility<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>The NeuroCom VSR system is the only system that meets the above requirements.

Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>This is a request to purchase of hardware. Purchase of this hardware enables User assessment of a fuel cell system in support of a two-man Overwatch mission.  The particular fuel cell of interest is manufactured by SFC Smart Fuel Cell AG and is their Jenny model, a portable fuel cell developed specifically for military use. The system consists of fuel, fuel cell (i.e. converter), power manager, pouches, and cables. The Jenny was developed, in part, with funds from the US Air Force. The Jenny is unique in that it directly converts a liquid fuel (methanol) into electricity. Significant weight savings are expected with the use of this system vs. the current approach used by Soldiers. Procurement of the system will enable Users to assess its utility thru lab and field evaluations.<BR><BR>2.

A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>No formal market research was conducted.

A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>SFC's uses a Direct Methanol approach to converting fuel to electricity. Another vendor, Ultracell, uses a competing approach to accomplish the same end. Ultracell's technology is referred to as Reformed Methanol.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Center  Ft. Bragg intends to negotiate a contract, on a sole source basis, with Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. of Arlington, Virginia, utilizing other than full and open competition under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1. The requirement is for the provision of a database including entries for all business establishments in the United States, including the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Entries include but are not limited to the following: Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, number of employees, mailing address, and physical address. The database is to be provided on digital video disc (DVD). The Point of Contact (POC) for this requirement is Mr. Brandon A. Hawkins, brandon.a.hawkins@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>This requirement is in direct support of the Defense Civilian Personnel Management Service (CPMS), Wage Setting Division (WAGE) in coordination with the Information Systems Division (ISD). The CPMS Wage and Salary Division works with industries nationwide to conduct surveys of the respective local prevailing wage rates to develop and adjust pay schedules under the Federal Wage System. The FWS covers Federal trade, craft, and laborer employees who are paid from appropriated and non-appropriated funds. Separate wage schedules are developed for appropriated fund hourly employees and non-appropriated craft, trade, labor, administrative, and patron services occupations. The Division also conducts occupational/industry surveys to establish pay for DoD educators, civilian mariners, power generation employees, and health care professionals.<BR><BR>A key statutory principle underlying the FWS is that employee pay rates are to be maintained in line with prevailing levels of pay for comparable levels of work in the private sector within a local wage area. In order to maintain compliance with this statutory principle, WAGE conducts annual wage surveys to collect wage data from private sector establishments. The database obtained from Dun and Bradstreet is used to develop the pool of survey participants. An essential entry required for each business listing is the assigned Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number. Each DUNS number is unique to the individual company and is used to track and identify establishments within the database and associated systems. This numbering system is maintained and copyrighted by the Dun and Bradstreet Corporation. The DUNS number is the primary entry used by the existing survey systems and database tools to index and catalog data. The unavailability of the DUNS number would require the development and use of an alternative identification scheme and substantial reprogramming to existing systems. <BR><BR>There are no known companies or individuals capable of providing the data referenced herein. Interested organizations may identify their interest in the referenced requirement and demonstrate their equivalent capability to provide the required service. Interested organizations should provide a statement of their capabilities and qualifications via email to the identified POC no later than 3:00 pm EDT on 05 May 2010. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to the identified POC; oral communications will not be accepted in response to this notice. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the proper approach to fulfilling the referenced contractual requirement. The determination whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis is solely within the discretion of the Government. <BR><BR>NOTE: Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these services. No solicitation documents exist at this time and there is no anticipation of a solicitation issuance. Requests for a solicitation will not be entertained. The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information the Contractor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. <BR>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>

<DESC>Please read the ENTIRE synopsis before submitting any response.
<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has a Brand Name Only requirement for the purchase of Commvault Back-Up, Restoral and Archival System (see attached for configuration). This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40, 23 March 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423430 and the size standard is 100 employees.</p>
<p>The 10th Communication Squadron (10 CS) has a requirement for a Back-Up/Restoral/Archiving (BURA) solution. 10 CS currently uses EMC Networker for back-ups and restoral. Current solution only does back-up and restoral. 10 CS is looking to upgrade capabilities to support changes in future IT solutions. 10 CS conducted extensive market research into BURA solutions. In their market research, they evaluated EMC Networker, Commvault Simpana, Microsoft Data Protection Manager (DPM), CA Arcserve, IBM Tivoli Storage Manager, HP Dataprotector and Symantec NetBackup.</p>
<p>Based upon this research, 10 CS found Commvault is the only BURA capable of providing a single integrated solution that will support object level back-ups and restores of Active Directory, Exchange and Sharepoint objects. Over the last three years, 10 CS has had objects and Organizational Units (OU) deleted from active directory domain. They have also been asked to restore message(s) at least weekly from Microsoft Exchange. Current solution requires a complex process to restore the active directory database. 10 CS efforts to restore deleted objects have been about 50% successful. During the restoral, network operations are degraded while authoritative restores are done to the domain. Restoring single messages in Exchange are just as complicated. Process requires restoring entire database and using utilities to merge restored messages with production databases. This takes a great deal of manpower and time to restore each message. Commvault's ability to provide object level restores of both AD and Exchange messages will significantly reduce complexity of restores and reduce the manpower required. Symantec NetBackup supports these features, IBM Tivoli, HP Dataprotector and Microsoft DPM support some of these features, but not all.</p>
<p>10 CS found that Commvault integrates data deduplication without an add-on product. Without data deduplication, files that are backed up repeatedly use excess numbers of tapes and slowing backups down. An analysis performed in CY 2009 showed 81% of USAFA network drive data had not changed in 6 months. A data deduplication capability would reduce back-up times and reduce the cost of tapes correspondingly. All products, with the exception of Microsoft DPM, indicate they support data deduplication.</p>
<p>10 CS found Commvault supports custom definable administrator rights so users only have permissions to back-up and restore data on systems they are authorized to. USAFA has other data centers besides those operated by 10 CS. Those data centers use other products for back-up and restoral. This feature will allow USAFA to merge all BURA capabilities into one vendor and reduce costs by eliminating multiple tape libraries and support license agreements. The only other solution indicating they supported this capability was CA Arcserve.</p>
<p>Commvault supports image level back-up of VMWare ESX, Microsoft Windows and Sun Solaris. 10 CS is transitioning from a single server per application environment to one based upon servers running on virtual machines in both a Microsoft HyperV or VMWare ESX virtual server environment. Native support for virtual OS's is important to disaster recovery in the event 10 CS has to recover servers to alternate data centers in a short period of time. Restoring the virtual machine with data intact is much faster then re-imaging the virtual server OS and then restoring data. All products, with the exception of Microsoft DPM, indicate they support virtual back-ups. Microsoft DPM only supports HyperV. EMC Networker requires the purchase of another product called Avamar to support.</p>
<p>Commvault supports content-based data reports based upon Clinger-Cohen act queries. Because of several incidents at USAFA, 10 CS had to pull together reports of e-mails and files pertaining to certain legal actions against USAFA leadership. The ability to conduct directed searches for messages and files meeting search criteria will reduce time and manpower necessary to respond to these inquires plus ensure all data is provided.</p>
<p>10 CS believes Commvault is the only BURA solution on the market that provides all of these capabilities in a single, integrated solution. Commvault is also approved to run on Air Force networks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Commvault is in use on the usafa.af.mil portion of USAFA network as well as is the standard used by AFNETOPS for BURA of the AFSPC.af.mil portion of the AF network. 10 CS has already received training on operations of Commvault and support. Having a single common BURA solution between .mil and .edu networks will reduce training costs to 10 CS as well as allow support for any issues from AFNETOPS sources.</p>
<p>Delivery is to be made to IT Accountability 5136 Community Center Drive East Loading Dock at the U.S. Air Force Academy.<br />FOB: Destination.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME. <br />Any offerors believing they can provide an equal product that meets all of the features and functionality of the Commvault Back-Up, Restoral and Archival System may provide evidence for consideration.

<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has a Brand Name Only requirement for the purchase of Cisco Line Cards. The requirements are as follows: Cat 6500 Supervisor 720 with 2 ports, Cisco CAT6000-VSS720 IOS IP Services, 10Gbase-LR X2 Module, Catalyst 6500 Multilayer Switch Feature Card, Catalyst 6500 Sup 720-10G Policy Feature Card 3C, Catalyst 6500 Supervisor 720 with 2 10Gbe Ports, SP Adapter for SUP720 and SUP720-10G, Catalyst 6500 Compact Flash Memory 1GB, Bootflash for SUP720-64MB-RP, Catalyst 6500 3000W AC Power Supply (Spare), Power Cord 250Vac 16A Twist Lock NEMA L6-20 Plug, Catalyst 6500 24-port GigE Mod Fabric-Enabled, Catalyst 6500 256MB DDR xCEF720, Catalyst 6500 Central Fwd Card for WS-X67xx Modules, Catalyst 6500 48-port 10/100/1000 w/Jumbo Frame RJ-45, GE SFP LC Connector SX Transceiver, and GE SFP LC Connector LX/LH Transceiver. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40, 23 March 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 423430 and the size standard is 100 employees.</p>
<p>Cisco is the only brand name technically capable of providing the components to USAFA's network. Only a Cisco Ethernet card can be replaced by another Cisco Ethernet card in Cisco equipment. The cadet dormitories are currently running 10/100 Mbps 48-port line cards. This limits performance to cadets as they access network services. Upgrading their ports to 10/100/1000 Mbps will give them a ten-fold increase in performance and better meet their needs for data access. These dorm line cards must be Cisco because they will be replacing already existing Cisco line cards and be placed in Cisco chassis.</p>
<p>Delivery is to be made to IT Accountability 5136 Community Center Drive East Loading Dock at the U.S. Air Force Academy.<br />FOB: Destination.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.

<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has a Brand Name Only requirement for the purchase of Dell 22 in 2209WA Flat Panel Monitors with Ax510 SoundBar, Dell 22 in 2209WA Flat Panel Monitors, and Dell Professional 1909W Widescreen 19 in Viewable Image LCD Monitors. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40, 23 March 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334119 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The USAF Academy has a Brand Name Only requirement to purchase Dell Professional 1909W, Widescreen, 19 in Viewable Image LCD Monitors. Dell LCD Monitors have been approved by the 10th Communications Squadron as the standard across the USAFA .mil network. Per AFNetOps Functional Concepts, para 6.5, "Standardization of configurations, processes, and applications across the enterprise, from the gateway to the desktop, will facilitate centralized management, enhance security through configuration control, and save manpower in certification and accreditation, patch implementation, hardware/software upgrades and asset tracking." Also per para 6.1, "Robust, redundant data paths and nodes with both physical and logical diversity are needed to maximize effectiveness and eliminate single points of failure. This will enable the integration of distributed capabilities, improve real-time detection/correlation of network anomalies, and give the AFNetOps Commander a comprehensive picture of any potential network degradation, outage, or attack. As importantly, it will help the NetOps community better understand the impact of network actions and the war-fighting operations that rely on their support."</p>
<p>This guidance lends itself to procuring, configuring and maintaining one standard platform per network that can be cannibalized if necessary, switched out with no impacts and easily repaired physically or remotely when needed. Also, a single platform makes the process of tracking products under warranty more efficient. To maintain continuity within its system, the Academy has 2 Dell Certified Technicians (GS Civilians) who are authorized to work on all Dell systems. Those techs are given priority at Dell and are authorized overnight turnaround for Dell parts ordered.</p>
<p>The Academy server farm is standardized on Microsoft Operating Systems, ensuring continuity of training for our Network Administration staff. Limited platforms enable fast and accurate troubleshooting and reduce training overhead.</p>
<p>Although other brands, such as HP or IBM would meet our need from a technological standpoint, they incur much greater complexity for management and administration, due to the increasing number of discrete hardware platforms and the fact that USAFA has multiple independent networks. In addition, purchasing other brands would not meet the guidance of the AFNetOps Functional Concepts described above.</p>
<p>By standardizing on Dell, we are able to manage and administer multiple networks, multiple platforms and the associated training and troubleshooting tasks that are unique to each. Standardizing on Dell to support our machines with Microsoft operating systems enable our technicians to do more with less in an ever-changing technological environment.</p>

<DESC>The US Navy is conducting a Request for Information to determine availabilityof Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) low costInertial Navigation Sensor (INS) that provide higher weapons systems accuracyand availability than legacy U.S. Navy fielded units.   The requirements forthe INS include, but are not limited to, the following:- Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) Technology- Strap-down (non-indexed) operation- Alignment time in 25 mins or less- Heading output equal to or less than 0.01 degrees times secant (Lat) rms whenaided and 0.02 degrees times secant (Lat) rms without aiding from an externalreference source- Roll & Pitch output of 0.01 degrees rms (with or without aiding)- Autonomous rejection of erroneous input data- Sensor & system level diagnostics- Weigh less than 60 lbsThis test and evaluation will attempt to fill a gap that currently exists withthe performance of existing INS. The proposed technology is expected to: 1)improve some critical navigation parameters, namely velocity and attitude; 2)reduce operation and maintenance costs; and 3) deliver a more mission-criticaland technologically superior product to the warfighter.  Expected benefitsinclude the mitigation of significant performance issues with supportingweapons system requirements and Total Ownership Cost (TOC) of legacy INS.All information received will be treated as public knowledge; therefore,vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI.Specific information sought includes:1. Company name and address2. Whether the company is a manufacturer or distributor3. Point of contact, telephone, fax and email address4. Brief product description, specifically citing INS performance criteriabased on the requirements specified above.5. Additional product information such as reliability, maintainability,durability, environmental limits, past EQT accomplished.6. Cost information such as expected per unit cost in single quantity ormultiple quantities, any GSA schedule cost, replacement parts, accessoryoptions, and available warranties.7. Identification of and information on military or commercial ships currentlyusing the INS.The submitted information will be evaluated for potential consideration inplanning future INS assessments.  If a future INS assessment on this type ofequipment is executed, the equipment selection will be based on a number offactors, including technical capability and cost.  Vendors may be contactedfollowing submission for more detailed product information.  Vendor providedinformation may be reformatted for publication in FCT program documents.The submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not tobe construed as a commitment by the government to procure items/services, orfor the government to pay for the information received.  No solicitationdocument exists at this time.Submittals:  Information about a particular brand/product should be submittedin an electronic format by 4:00pm on 04 May 2010 by email to:ins_fct@spawar.navy.mil.

<p>GENERAL DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Medical Waste Steam Autoclave Sterlizer is the most widely used and most efficient alternative medical-waste-treatment technology. The sterilizer are designed to handle both biohazard and normal hospital wastes simultaneously. In Sterilzer's, the effects of heat from saturated steam and increased pressure decontaminate medical waste by inactivating and destroying microorganisms. There are two types of medical waste steam autoclaves, gravity displacement and pre-vacuum. Those designed for medical waste are mostly gravity displacement.</p>

<p>Performance Work Statement</p>
<p>Background and Need <br />Through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the CDC is building the capacity of resource-constrained nations to strategically collect and use information for program accountability and improvement. CDC collaborates with U.S. government PEPFAR partners, host governments, Ministries of Health, non-governmental organizations, U.S.-based universities, and the private sector to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>To better understand the relationships among population, HIV prevalence, and existing services, CDC:<br />&bull; Builds in-country capacity to design, implement, and evaluate HIV/AIDS-related surveillance systems and surveys; and assists and trains countries on how to analyze, disseminate, and use HIV/AIDS data.<br />&bull; Develops tools, guidelines, recommendations, and policies to translate research for improved planning and program implementation.<br />&bull; Evaluates and implements novel approaches for conducting surveillance and surveys.</p>
<p>Considering the well reported importance of monitoring the epidemics and the behavior of most at risk populations (MARPs) for HIV, the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA (INLS) has requested assistance in conducting behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) in Angola with MARPs. <br />Due to the potential vulnerability of uniformed service personnel (border patrol and police), miners, and prisoners to HIV and sexually transmitted infections, the INLS has requested that behavioral surveillance surveys with biomarkers (BSS+) be conducted in Angola. To inform the conduct of the BSS+ among vulnerable populations, it is necessary to perform preliminary field investigations or formative assessments. This competitive solicitation is for the formative assessment for the target populations. Based on the results of this competition and findings of the formative assessment, a sole-source contract will be awarded to conduct the subsequent BSS+ studies.</p>

By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies. <br />(4) Added: Denial of Access of Contractor Employees. The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons. This action does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.<br />(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.</p>

FAR 13-106-2 Evaluation of Quotations or Offers - The Government intends to award one contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror using the lowest price/technically acceptable source selection process.

Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If an offer has been determined acceptable (go) on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror's past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then that its quotation evaluated for the lowest price.

Factor 1 - Technical capability - The minimum criteria for acceptably for this factor shall be the submission a list of key personnel and their current certification by the National Association of the Deaf, or the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, or be included in Virginia's Directory of qualified Interpreters.

Factor 2  This standard is based upon the offerors ability to substantiate credible examples of past performance associated with their commercial and/or Government offerings, including delivery, schedule compliance, product quality and overall customer satisfaction.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances; it will not be based upon absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government will seek to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely service.

The minimum criteria for acceptability under this factor shall be information submitted by the offerors from three (3) sources that clearly indicate they have satisfactorily provided the same or similar product commercially or to the Government within the past three (3) years.  This information shall include:
		a. Contract Number
		b. Point of Contact
		c. Telephone number
		d. Dollar Amount of Contract
		e. Brief description of product provided

The Government is not limited to the information provided above, but reserves the right to independently seek past performance information through open market contacts, government systems, and other government agencies. 

(b)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(d) Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed  labor hour contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all proposals received and not award any item or items from this solicitation.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information, included in this notice. This announcement constitutes as the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation is attached. HSFEHQ-10-R-0072 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular. This requirement is being procured under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and will be set aside for HUBZone Small Businesses. The NAICS code is 238910. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to procure services for the destruction and removal of storm damaged Temporary Housing Units (THU) for the following location:<br />Sherwood Number of THU's<br />2695 N Sherwood Drive (20)<br />Baton Rouge, LA 70814</p>
<p>The services include cleaning, destruction and removal of THU's located in the FEMA Staging Yard. Destruction and removal will occur on an as-needed basis, as determined by FEMA. THU's may be travel trailers, park model mobile homes or full-size mobile homes. The "destruction" phase of the work may require removal of hazardous materials (e.g., kitchen, bath, and laundry cleaners, household items such as paints, oils, batteries, etc.) Various recyclable components such as aluminum and copper may have salvage value and FEMA understands that the successful contractor may recycle these materials to their own benefit. It is FEMA's intent that all units are cleared of all hazardous debris, broken down and destroyed, and all components, including the frame, be removed from the site within a ten (10) working days. All interested vendors must submit a plan to meet a 10 day schedule. A mandatory site visit will be scheduled for April 26, 2010. Please view SF 1449 for details. Personnel: Contractors will be required to provide a valid driver's license photo ID to gain site access. BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government will make award to the responsible/responsive offeror whose offer will be most advantageous to the Government based on lowest price/technically acceptable factors. In order to be found technically acceptable, the offeror must be capable of providing the services as specified and within the parameters specified. The requirements detailed in this solicitation shall be used as criteria to evaluate offerors. The provision at FAR 52.212-1 "Instructions to Offerors--Commercial" applies to this acquisition, if the offeror is proposing open market pricing. The provision at FAR 52.212-2 "Evaluation-Commercial Items" applies to price/technically acceptable factors. Offerors are to include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 "Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items" with their response or provide this information via the ORCA website, http://orca.bpn.gov. The following FAR clauses also apply to open market pricing: 52.212-4 "Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items and 52.212-5 "Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items,". FAR provision 52.217-9 also applies to this award. The aforementioned FAR provisions and clauses can be accessed electronically at http://www.arnet.gov/far. A written notice of award or acceptance of quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Written responses to this RFQ are due by 3:00 PM/EST, 04-29-2010 and may be emailed to Toye.Hobday@dhs.gov and Carolyn.Abney@dhs.gov. Mailed responses shall be addressed to Federal Emergency Management Agency, Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, ATTN: Toye Hobday 395 E Street, S.W., PP 5th Floor, Washington, DC 20472. You must send an email to announce that a mailed copy will be received on the due date. Emailed quotations are preferred. Offerors are reminded that award can only be made to a Contractor who is registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and ORCA. Technical and/or administrative questions must be emailed to Toye.Hobday@dhs.gov and received no later than 11:00 AM/EST, 04-27-2010. Amendments to this RFQ will be published in the same manner as the initial synopsis/solicitation.

Guidance:  It is highly recommended that vendors respond directly to these Technical Requirements/Specifications that are attached to this solicititation and to this Selection/Evaluation Criteria.  Simply supplying a standard company quote without specifically addressing these items may result in disqualification from consideration.  The ability to adequately meet NETL's particular needs in these matters must be addressed in a clear and concise manner.   It is possible that not all of the requirements can be met; therefore, potential bidders shall clearly define their pump's strengths and weaknesses with respect to the attached requirements and clearly point out any limitations or variances.  Pricing shall be provided per individual pump, with any discounts shown for purchasing two pumps.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees and only small businesses shall be considered for award as this requirement is set-aside 100% for small business.
In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the manufacturer and distributor of these supplies must be a small business in accordance with the NAICS code identified. For size purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end item being acquired. The manufacturer is the concern which, with its own facilities, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or organic substances, including the assembly of parts and components, into the end item being acquired.  The end item must possess characteristics which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not possess before the original substances, parts or components were assembled or transformed.  

The end item may be finished and ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semi-finished as a raw material 
to be used in further manufacturing. Firms which perform only minimal operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for an Environmental Chamber for a diffractometer made in-house by NIST.  NIST conducts experiments with a diffractometer for which the temperature of the samples in the apparatus must be as constant as possible. The laboratory temperature is unreliable and may vary as much as 2.5C over a 30 minute period. The diffractometer is equipped with insulation so that whatever temperature stability is achieved in the area surrounding the apparatus is improved by a factor of 10 inside the apparatus. To maintain a more stable temperature around the diffractometer, NIST requires an insulated environmental chamber in which to place the diffractometer, equipped with air handling capabilities, as specified below. 

All interested Contractors shall provide a quote for the following line items:
Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) each, Environmental Chamber which shall meet or exceed the following required minimum specifications.  All equipment must be new. Refurbished and/or remanufactured shall not be considered.

The chamber shall have no floor; walls shall be sealed and anchored down to the existing concrete floor.  Chamber shall have one (1) 42" W 78" H door installed centrally on the front wall;

3. Temperature Control: 
The temperature inside the chamber shall be controlled by drawing the main lab air through the chamber using a circulation exhaust fan. The operating temperature of the chamber shall be dependent on the temperature of the air in the main lab, the heat generated by the diffractometer, and how much air is drawn through the chamber.  The Contractor shall provide a method whereby the temperature of the chamber can actively be controlled by monitoring the temperature of the exhaust air and controlling the speed of the fan. The sensitivity of the temperature monitor shall be 0.05C or better. Preference will be given to greater sensitivity. 

The temperature controlling system shall be software controlled and shall be able to provide a record of the chamber temperature which shall be available by direct data transfer to a computer through a COM port or USB port. The 
software shall be off-the-shelf software that shall record automatically, every minute, and directly download.  The 
temperature controlling system provided shall work with a personal computer running Windows XP.  

The Contractor shall provide the necessary cable. It must be possible to disable the active temperature control and directly control the speed of the fan using the software control. A personal computer is not required to be provided as part of the temperature control system. The Government will provide a personal computer with the serial parallel and USB ports.

4. Air Handling:
The chamber shall have one (1) ball bearing exhaust fan mounted centrally on top of the chamber connected to one or more exhaust port holes in ceiling of the chamber.  The fan shall not generate more than 55 dB of noise. The fan shall draw air through the chamber from four intake grilles located within 1 foot of the floor. The grilles shall have an area of 0.5 to 1 sq ft.  Two of the grilles shall be located on the front wall of the chamber (side with door) and two of the grilles will be located on the opposite wall.  All grilles shall have adjustable air intake louvers adjustable from the inside of the chamber.

The chamber shall be installed in a laboratory that is currently scheduled for renovation.  Renovations are anticipated to be completed no later than May 30, 2010; however, this date is subject to change.  As NIST may not have storage capacity to store the chamber, the Contractor must delay the manufacture of the chamber so that it is delivered and installed when the laboratory renovations are completed.

The NIST Technical Information Contact (TIC) (to be identified at the time of award) shall maintain contact with the Contractor on a bi-weekly or monthly basis via telephone or e-mail, to advise the Contractor of the status of the renovation project. The TIC shall notify the Contractor when renovations are expected to be completed in sufficient time that the Contractor can manufacture the chamber in accordance with their required delivery timeline. 

Delivery terms shall be FOB DESTINATION.  FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

<DESC>The Clinical Center at National Institutes of Health proposes to procure System Administration Services to help install the equipment necessary to create a Clinical Data Mart, in accordance with the procedures for acquiring commercial items/services authorized in FAR Part 12. The Data Mart will create a system redundancy that will enable the Critical Clinical Systems to be bought back in line within 24 hours or less.
<p>This is a Combined Synopsis for Commercial Services prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This notice constitutes the only solicitation; a separate solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation NIHCL2010047 includes all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38 date December 10 2009.

This production application requires additional modules and occasional modifications and maintenance</p>

The O&M status will be based on the NRCS O&M evaluation criteria listed in the National O&M Manual, found at http://policy.nrcs.usda.gov/ under Title 180.

Task orders may include options for the selected firm(s) to provide LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) data for the dam reservoir and a specified distance upstream and/or downstream.  

The breach analysis shall be performed in accordance with performance specifications included in the task orders.  A final drawing of the breach inundation map will be submitted in the *.dwg format (AutoCad Map 2008 or 2009) and associated computer files will be provided to the government. 

The selected firm(s) will complete Exhibit 508.1, Priority Ranking Spreadsheet from the National Watershed Manual (NWM) (see http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/programs/watershed/index.html).  The spreadsheet includes risk and failure indices, as well as indices for static failure, hydrologic failure, seismic failure and consequences of dam failure. 

The final assessment report for each dam will include the following:
	Description of the condition of the existing dam and appurtenances,
	Breach inundation map for the existing structure,
	Status of the dam's O&M,
	Potential conceptual rehabilitation alternatives, including site specific restraints,
	Estimated cost ranges for the identified potential rehabilitation alternatives, and
	Completed NWM Exhibit 508.1.

All material associated with the assessments will be provided in electronic format and four (4) hard copies.  Electronic submissions must be compatible with Microsoft Office Suite programs, Adobe Acrobat or AutoCad Map 2008 or 2009.  Electronic copies, original hard copies and copies for distribution are to be furnished to NRCS.  All material used to document the design will be treated as Personally Identifiable Information and will become the property of the NRCS.

PRESELECTION CRITERIA: Firms must meet the following criteria in order to be considered for an award under this requirement: Have a minimum of one engineer employed on a full time basis. At least one engineer must be a Registered Professional Engineer in the state of North Dakota and have a minimum of ten years experience in water resource engineering.

SELECTION CRITERIA:  Firm(s) meeting the pre-selection criteria will be evaluated and ranked using the following selection criteria listed below. For this solicitation, Factors 1 and 5 are equally important and will be weighted at twice the value of Factors 2 through 4.  Factors 2 through 4 will be evaluated as equally important.  

1. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of engineering work required.  Evaluation will be based on the extent of directly related experience and competence in hydrology, hydraulics, surveying, and other features associated with earthen embankment dams.  Considerations will include knowledge and experience within the last five years in: the analysis and assessment of earth, roller compacted concrete and concrete flood prevention and water storage dams and related appurtenances; technical reviews of flood prevention and other water resource related projects.  Demonstrated experience completing assessments and designs following NRCS National O&M Manual, TR60, TR25, NEM and NEH and similar guidelines will be used as a tie breaker among the most highly qualified technically equal firms.  Prime firm's experience will be weighted more heavily than subcontractor's experience.  Examples of work shall be documented for review, as well as a description of the type and scope of work performed. 

2.  Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance.  Evaluation will be based on knowledge level associated with the requirements above.  Consideration will be given to applicable education, training, and certifications.

3.  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Evaluation will consider number of personnel realistically available in the disciplines described above, the quantity of current work orders and services being provided to other clients and schedules for completion of existing work. 

4.  Location in the general geographic area.  Evaluation will be based on the firms office location(s) and proximity to the work, which is within the state of North Dakota.

5.  Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry.  Evaluation will be based on previous contracts performed for water resource engineering type projects. Evaluation will consider the work performed, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules and cost control.  A list of reference and letters of recommendation with company seal of logo may be submitted for evaluation purposes.

Firm(s), which meet the requirements described in this announcement, are invited to submit four (4) copies of Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, and any other information relative to the selection criteria to the contracting office address listed above to the attention of the Contracting Officer by 4:00 p.m. Central Time on May 17, 2010.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 and Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and quotes are hereby being requested. Solicitation PR-NC-10-10467 is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to solicit and award a firm-fixed price contract under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13. This requirement is being solicited as an unrestricted procurement. The North American Industry classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 size standard of $25M.	This requirement is being solicited for new software product, accompanying licenses and software maintenance services.  Therefore, this procurement is a combination of both products and services with the majority of the cost attributed to the software product because the amount of users is being increased from four thousand three hundred (4,300) users, which our current order accommodates, to twenty-five thousand (25,000) users which the new contract will be for.  This requirement is for  WorkPlaceControl brand software which supports the EPA?s Lotus Notes system.  Therefore, this requirement requires not any software program to manage Lotus Notes; it specifically requires the WorkPlaceControl brand of software to manage the EPA?s Lotus Notes system.  The majority of the applicable Brand Name Justification is listed in italics below after it was edited in accordance with FAR 6.305:
	The Agency's solution for a Lotus Notes client management system must not require the installation of local files.  Agency desktops are currently configured and supported by more than thirty (30) different help desk groups and our ability to control the installation and updating of local Notes client management files is nearly impossible.  For users in the managed desktop Computer Technology Services (CTS) environment, only those with administrative desktop privileges (a very small percentage of the user base) will have the ability to receive a file push of this nature.  Given the Agency's current distributed, non-standard workstation environment, we do not currently have the ability to ensure that the appropriate files would be updated or even initially installed. 
 This situation is especially true for the thirteen thousand (13,000) Notes flash drives that were deployed with CTS systems; our ability to obtain and install the required files for the Notes client onto those drives would be almost impossible and would place an undue burden on the help desk staffs supporting those users.  A similar burden would be placed on employees with Agency systems located in their homes for telecommuting purposes; those users would need to bring in their desktops (some of them tower systems).
	There is also another protocol issue that would have to be addressed if local files were installed for a requirement of this magnitude.  The installation of local files on more than twenty-five thousand (25,000) Agency desktops would require approval from the Quality Technology Sub-committee (QTS), the Agency's IT governance board, by the May deployment deadline which cannot be completed since the next QTS meeting is slated for the 4th quarter FY '10 timeframe.
	Lastly, the Agency is taking steps to make the workforce more mobile and less reliant on applications that require the installation of local files and, therefore, deploying a Notes client management system that requires the installation of local files would be contrary to this initiative.
	This requirement being solicited for a Period of Performance from May 15, 2010 ? May 14, 2011. FAR provisions and/or clauses referenced are available on-line at http://www.arnet.gov/far/. Solicitation Provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items is hereby incorporated by reference. Solicitation Provision FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -Commercial Items is hereby incorporated by reference with the fill-in for paragraph (a) of ?price is the only factor.?
Contractors are reminded to submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items with their quote.  Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items is hereby incorporated by reference. Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items is hereby incorporated by reference, as well as the following clauses cited in the clause which apply to this solicitation, 52.222-3, Convict Labor (E.O. 11755), 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities,  52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Special Disabled and Vietnam Era Veterans (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Handicapped Workers (29 U.S.C. 793),  52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration (31 U.S.C. 3332), 52.239-1 and Privacy or Security Safeguards (5 U.S.C. 3332).  
	Payments will be made monthly upon approval of monthly invoices. Signed and dated quotes referencing the number PR-NC-10-10467 must be submitted, no later than 2:00 p.m. May 06, 2010, to Dan Neustedter at FAX (919) 541-0611 or neustedter.dan@epa.gov.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>Can you confirm the manufactures of cameras and dvr's that you need like kind and quality of? Is it electronic line? Can you also confirm if there are 4 new dome cameras and 2 new ptz's ( for a total of 6 new) . Are you asking for a 2 year warranty of the old wiring and power supply? I would suggest replacing the power supply too, it's not all that expensive.
<p>Although the first two CLINS appear to be Electronic Line and the next CLINS Sony...it is VERY important to remember, all of these items are "or equal". In other words, they must function together as a system to accomplish the required quality surveillance and recording, but need not be any particular brand. The site visit should clarify these and any additional concerns. Naturally, a reasonably long life-span is required.&nbsp; A confirmation of 6 new cameras is correct (4 indoor mini dome and 2 PTZ).&nbsp;The 2-year warranty using existing wiring and power supply remains unchanged.</p>

<DESC>*** 20 April 2010 ***
<p>There have been a few questions relating to certain parts of the purchase description that have been asked and the responses to those questions have been posted here for viewing. This amendment also extends the due date for proposals by 3 weeks to 17 May 2010.</p>
<p>Question: Please provide specific dimensions of the scales that are being<br />calibrated, i.e., length, width, height.</p>
<p>Response: The sizes of the scales vary.</p>
<p>Question: How will the scales be centered in the calibration frame? We are<br />particularly interested in how the corner test will be performed. An example of a test article would be insightful.</p>
<p>Response: I have no test articles available, but I can provide examples of Mfrs and<br />P/Ns, if necessary.</p>
<p>Question: What are the details of the top of the scale? Flat surface or<br />mechanical connection?</p>
<p>Response: The scale will be calibrated as received (assembled) but the press may be needed to adjust the scale, which may mean that the top may have to be removed. In all cases, there will be a plate between the press load cell and the scale.</p>
<p>Question: 4.4.5.2.1 of purchase description. The transit case called out, ECS 00017529 has dimensions of L-19.01 x W 12.01 x H10 can multiple load cells be place in one case or does each load have to have its own case. Some of the smaller load cells could be combined.</p>
<p>Response: Per 4.1.5.2.1, each load cell is to have its own case.</p>
<p>Question: 4.1.5.1 All components shall be corrosion proof, does this mean that the press has to be stainless steel or can components be plated or treated for corrosion. Do the electrical control cabinets have to be stainless steel Nema 4.</p>
<p>Response: No, all components of the press (load frame), load cell and adapters shall be corrosion-proof. Electronic components are excluded. No other requirements have been stated.</p>
<p><br />Question: 4.1.5.3 The load cell calls for 340uin or .00034 thousands of the inch is this correct.</p>
<p>Response: Yes; The PD says no less than 340 uin, but not no greater than. This, of course, means it can be larger than 340 uin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: What type of surface material and size should the load cell have mounted on the surface which comes in contact with the scales.</p>
<p>Response: Distribution plates will be used between the load cell and scale; load cell surface shall be such that it will not cause deformation/damage to both a 1.75 in Al plate or a 0.5 in hardened steel plate. It also shall not cause damage to the load cell itself.</p>
<p><br />Question: 4.1.5.4 The flatness for the 48 x 48 inch working surface is call out a 200 uin or .0002 thousands of the inch. Please clarify if this means .0002 per inch for a total of .0096 over the total surface.</p>
<p><br />Response: Again, the PD says no less than 200 uin, not no greater than. This means that it can be larger than 200 uin. No - the spec is not 200 uin per inch, but it could be if the mfr states it in the overall uncertainty analysis.</p>
<p>Question: 4.1.4.3 What range on the 48 x 48 inch working surface should the load call be able to reach. Should these limits be reach under power or manually.<br />If powered the load cell must then be driven on 2 axis over the table and a third axis the apply the test load.</p>
<p>Response: Para 4.1.4.5 states that the working height shall be 4 to 10 inches. Para 4.4.2.3 states that there will be a manual override. Para 3.1 says the press shall be able to be run in both manual and automatic mode.</p>

<DESC>DATE:  4/20/10<BR>SUBJECT:  Additional Questions and Answers<BR>FBO Solicitation:  F9A2MA0083A001<BR><BR>Question #1: You noted in the addendum that we were to remove one of the 4dr vertical files, but the revised spreadsheet still shows a quantity of 3.  So I just wanted to verify that you only want 2 of the 4dr verticals.  Answer #1:  Yes, the quantity for the Four Drawer Vertical File, item # 8, is reduced from 3 to 2 per the attached Bldg 81 Quote Sheet Revision 2.<BR><BR>Question #2: I was also questioning the width of them - the vertical files.  You show 16.75 inches and verticals typically come 15 inches wide for letter files and 18 inches wide for legal files.  Answer #2: The verticals needed are for letter files.  The sizes listed on the Quote Sheet are overall outside dimensions and are approximate.<BR>  <BR>Question #3: What exactly are they looking for for the Podium - item #16?  Does it have to be a certain size or just something they can set a computer on and a grommet for the cords?  Answer #3: The podium must be computer capable with grommets for cords and have wheels, preferably that can lock.  It should be standard size to stand behind and operate a laptop computer from.  A podium that matches the 18x84 inch tables in color and style is preferred.<BR><BR>All other aspects of the Solicitation/Request for Quote remain unchanged. <BR> <BR>*****LAST ITEM*****<BR><BR>__________//signed//__________________			April 20, 2010<BR>Gregory P Johnson, Contract Specialist 			       (Date)<BR><BR>South Dakota Air National Guard<BR>114 FW / MSC - Contracting<BR>1201 West Algonquin ST<BR>Sioux Falls, SD 57104-0264<BR>Gregory.johnson@sdsiou.ang.af.mil<BR>Phone 605-988-5932<BR>FAX 605-988-5997<BR><BR><BR>

<p>2. Line Item 0001 is hereby amended to incorporate changes to the technical specifications as follows:</p>
<p>2.1 Specification 3 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:<br />3. Temperature Control: The temperature inside the chamber shall be controlled by drawing the main lab air through the chamber using a circulation exhaust fan. The operating temperature of the chamber shall be dependent on the temperature of the air in the main lab, the heat generated by the diffractometer, and how much air is drawn through the chamber. The Contractor shall provide a method whereby the temperature of the chamber can actively be controlled by monitoring the temperature of the exhaust air and controlling the speed of the fan. The sensitivity of the temperature monitor shall be &plusmn;0.05&deg;C or better. Preference will be given to greater sensitivity.<br />The temperature controlling system shall be software controlled and shall be able to provide a record of the chamber temperature which shall be available by direct data transfer to a computer through a COM port or USB port. The software shall be off-the-shelf software that shall record automatically, every minute, and directly download. The temperature controlling system provided shall work with a personal computer running Windows XP. The Contractor shall provide the necessary cable. It must be possible to disable the active temperature control and directly control the speed of the fan using the software control. A personal computer is not required to be provided as part of the temperature control system. The Government will provide a personal computer with the serial parallel and USB ports.</p>
<p>TO:<br />3. Temperature Control: The temperature inside the chamber shall be controlled by drawing the main lab air through the chamber using a circulation exhaust fan. The operating temperature of the chamber shall be dependent on the temperature of the air in the main lab, the heat generated by the diffractometer, and how much air is drawn through the chamber. The heat generated by the diffractometer cannot be accurately assessed because the x-ray tubes, which are the main source of heat, are water cooled so much of the heat generated by them is removed from the chamber by the chilled water line. The temperature of the chamber shall be actively controlled by monitoring the temperature of the exhaust air and controlling the speed of the fan. The sensitivity of the temperature monitor shall be &plusmn;0.05&deg;C or better. <br />Preference will be given to greater sensitivity.</p>
<p>The temperature of the laboratory at a single position near the chamber can be monitored. It is required that the temperature stability of the chamber will be ten times better than the temperature stability of the laboratory; e.g., if the laboratory temperature varies by 2.5&deg;C in a one hour period, the chamber temperature must vary by 0.25&deg;C or less over the same period. There is no humidity control specification for the system. The final operating temperature of the chamber must be between 20&deg;C and 25&deg;C</p>
<p>The temperature controlling system shall be software controlled and shall be able to provide a record of the chamber temperature and the laboratory temperature which shall be available by direct data transfer to a computer through a COM port or USB port. The software shall be off-the-shelf software that shall record automatically, every minute, and directly download. The temperature controlling system provided shall work with a personal computer running Windows XP. The Contractor shall provide the necessary cable. It must be possible to disable the active temperature control and directly control the speed of the fan using the software control. A personal computer is not required to be provided as part of the temperature control system. The Government will provide a personal computer with the serial parallel and USB ports.</p>
<p>2.2 Specification 4 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:<br />4. Air Handling: The chamber shall have one (1) ball bearing exhaust fan mounted centrally on top of the chamber connected to one or more exhaust port holes in ceiling of the chamber. The fan shall not generate more than 55 dB of noise. The fan shall draw air through the chamber from four intake grilles located within 1 foot of the floor. The grilles shall have an area of 0.5 to 1 sq ft. Two of the grilles shall be located on the front wall of the chamber (side with door) and two of the grilles will be located on the opposite wall. All grilles shall have adjustable air intake louvers adjustable from the inside of the chamber.</p>
<p>TO:<br />4. Air Handling:<br />The chamber shall have one (1) ball bearing exhaust fan mounted centrally on top of the chamber connected to one or more exhaust port holes in ceiling of the chamber. The chamber exhaust/cooling fan must be capable of moving at least 100 cubic feet of air per minute through the chamber. The fan shall not generate more than 55 dB of noise. The fan shall draw air through the chamber from four intake grilles located within 1 foot of the floor. The grilles shall have an area of 0.5 to 1 sq ft. Two of the grilles must be located on the front wall of the chamber (side with door) and two of the grilles must be located on the opposite wall. All grilles shall have adjustable air intake louvers adjustable from the inside of the chamber.</p>
<p>2.3 Specification 6 is herby amended as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:<br />6. Cable feed through and interior cable trays. The Chamber shall have all of the following: (a) Three (3) 2" and one (1) 3" (inside diameter) PVC sleeved port holes through side walls; (b) Approximately 20' of cable tray hung from the ceiling.</p>
<p>TO:<br />6. Cable feed through and interior cable trays. The Chamber shall have all of the following:<br />(a) Three (3) 2" and one (1) 3" (inside diameter) PVC sleeved port holes through side walls;</p>
<p>(b) 20' of cable tray hung from the ceiling. The cable tray shall be two lengths each 10' long. It shall be suspended from the ceiling by rods or cables so that it is at least 6'6" but not more than 6'10" from the floor. It shall be of open channel type. The proposed type, materials and construction of the channel shall be specified.</p>
<p>3. The required submissions are hereby amended to add the following requirement to Paragraph 1 which reads "For the purpose of evaluation of Technical Capability, quoters shall submit all of the following:"</p>
<p>ADD:<br />"e. The Contractor shall specify the proposed type, materials and construction of the channel."</p>

<p>Question 1) When the temperature is 20C in the adjoining room and raises 2.5C in an hour, then what is the expected temperature in the room in an hour, 22.75?</p>
<p>Answer: If the temperature of the laboratory in which the chamber is situated goes from 20&deg;C to 22.5&deg;C in one hour, the chamber temperature is expected to rise no more than 0.25&deg;C from whatever temperature it was at the beginning of the hour. The purpose of the system is to reduce the effect of fluctuations in laboratory temperature, not to eliminate the effects of a permanent change in laboratory temperature.</p>
<p>Question 2) What will be the operating temperature of the room?</p>
<p>Answer: The operating temperature of the laboratory will be between 21&deg;C and 24&deg;C.</p>
<p><br />Question 3) What is the desired chamber temperature?</p>
<p>Answer: There is no set desired chamber temperature. The system is designed to reduce fluctuations in temperature to a minimum, not to maintain a predetermined temperature. See the answer to question 1 above.</p>
<p>2. Line Item 0001 is hereby amended to incorporate changes to the technical specifications as follows:</p>
<p>2.1 Specification 3 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:</p>
<p>3. Temperature Control: The temperature inside the chamber shall be controlled by drawing the main lab air through the chamber using a circulation exhaust fan. The operating temperature of the chamber shall be dependent on the temperature of the air in the main lab, the heat generated by the diffractometer, and how much air is drawn through the chamber. The heat generated by the diffractometer cannot be accurately assessed because the x-ray tubes, which are the main source of heat, are water cooled so much of the heat generated by them is removed from the chamber by the chilled water line. The temperature of the chamber shall be actively controlled by monitoring the temperature of the exhaust air and controlling the speed of the fan. The sensitivity of the temperature monitor shall be &plusmn;0.05&deg;C or better. <br />Preference will be given to greater sensitivity.<br />The temperature of the laboratory at a single position near the chamber can be monitored. It is required that the temperature stability of the chamber will be ten times better than the temperature stability of the laboratory; e.g., if the laboratory temperature varies by 2.5&deg;C in a one hour period, the chamber temperature must vary by 0.25&deg;C or less over the same period. There is no humidity control specification for the system. The final operating temperature of the chamber must be between 20&deg;C and 25&deg;C<br />The temperature controlling system shall be software controlled and shall be able to provide a record of the chamber temperature and the laboratory temperature which shall be available by direct data transfer to a computer through a COM port or USB port. The software shall be off-the-shelf software that shall record automatically, every minute, and directly download. The temperature controlling system provided shall work with a personal computer running Windows XP. The Contractor shall provide the necessary cable. It must be possible to disable the active temperature control and directly control the speed of the fan using the software control. A personal computer is not required to be provided as part of the temperature control system. The Government will provide a personal computer with the serial parallel and USB ports.</p>
<p>TO:</p>
<p>3. Temperature Control: The temperature inside the chamber shall be controlled by drawing the laboratory air through the chamber using a circulation exhaust fan. It shall be possible to actively control the temperature inside the chamber with a system that automatically monitors the temperature of the exhaust air and controls the speed of the fan. The sensitivity of the temperature monitor shall be &plusmn;0.05&deg;C or better. Preference will be given to greater sensitivity. It is required that the temperature fluctuations of the chamber (with the door closed) be ten times less than the temperature fluctuations of the laboratory over a one hour period; e.g., if, in a one hour period, the laboratory temperature rises by 2.5&deg;C and then falls to its original temperature, the chamber temperature must fluctuate by 0.25&deg;C or less over the same period. It shall be possible to adjust the control parameters of the temperature control system remotely by computer. The chamber temperature shall be available by direct data transfer to a computer. The temperature controlling system provided shall work with a personal computer running Windows XP. The Contractor shall provide the necessary cable. It must be possible to disable the active temperature control and directly control the speed of the fan using the software control. A personal computer is not required to be provided as part of the temperature control system; the Government will provide a personal computer. There is no humidity control specification for the system.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical questions submitted,and extend the due date for quotations.</p>
<p>1. The following question and response is hereby provided.</p>
<p>Question 1) If the temperature of the lab is 70F and rises to 72F in a hour, and the chambers temperature is 70F and can only rise to 70.5F in a hour using the lab air how is this possible?</p>
<p>Answer: If the temperature rises to 72&deg;F in an hour and stays there, then the chamber will slowly rise in temperature, but that is allowed by the spec.</p>

<p>Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors' performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement. For A-E contract<span><ins datetime="2010-02-16T16:27" cite="mailto:USACE"> </ins></span>Task Orders awarded at or above $30,000, the USACE will evaluate contractor's performance and prepare a performance report using the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), which is now a web-based system. After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days. Accessing and using ACASS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the users' computer. The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transactions. The certification software could cost approximately $110 - $125 per certificate per year and is purchased from an External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendor. Current information about the PKI certification process and for contacting vendors can be found on the website: http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil. If the Contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to ACASS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.</p>

<DESC>The Government intends to utilize a Construction Manager at Risk or Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Contract procedure for this requirement.   Under this concept, the CMc functions as a collaborative member of the project team.  The CMc will be responsible for all construction under a single contract and also provides expertise during the design process for the Government by checking estimates and performing constructability reviews.  If the Government exercises the optional ID/IQ services to award a task order for Design and Construction Documents, it is anticipated that award of the CMc contract will follow closely behind the award of the A&amp;E Services contract so that the CMc can provide the preconstruction services during the design phase.  At a pre-determined point in the design phase (likely between 50% and 70% design), the CMc offers a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Center  Ft. Bragg intends to negotiate a contract, on a sole source basis, with Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. of Arlington, Virginia, utilizing other than full and open competition under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1. The requirement is for the provision of a database including entries for all business establishments in the United States, including the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Entries include but are not limited to the following: Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, number of employees, mailing address, and physical address. The database is to be provided on digital video disc (DVD). The Point of Contact (POC) for this requirement is Mr. Brandon A. Hawkins, brandon.a.hawkins@us.army.mil.<br /><br />This requirement is in direct support of the Defense Civilian Personnel Management Service (CPMS), Wage Setting Division (WAGE) in coordination with the Information Systems Division (ISD). The CPMS Wage and Salary Division works with industries nationwide to conduct surveys of the respective local prevailing wage rates to develop and adjust pay schedules under the Federal Wage System. The FWS covers Federal trade, craft, and laborer employees who are paid from appropriated and non-appropriated funds. Separate wage schedules are developed for appropriated fund hourly employees and non-appropriated craft, trade, labor, administrative, and patron services occupations. The Division also conducts occupational/industry surveys to establish pay for DoD educators, civilian mariners, power generation employees, and health care professionals.<br /><br />A key statutory principle underlying the FWS is that employee pay rates are to be maintained in line with prevailing levels of pay for comparable levels of work in the private sector within a local wage area. In order to maintain compliance with this statutory principle, WAGE conducts annual wage surveys to collect wage data from private sector establishments. The database obtained from Dun and Bradstreet is used to develop the pool of survey participants. An essential entry required for each business listing is the assigned Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number. Each DUNS number is unique to the individual company and is used to track and identify establishments within the database and associated systems. This numbering system is maintained and copyrighted by the Dun and Bradstreet Corporation. The DUNS number is the primary entry used by the existing survey systems and database tools to index and catalog data. The unavailability of the DUNS number would require the development and use of an alternative identification scheme and substantial reprogramming to existing systems. <br /><br />There are no known companies or individuals capable of providing the data referenced herein. Interested organizations may identify their interest in the referenced requirement and demonstrate their equivalent capability to provide the required service. Interested organizations should provide a statement of their capabilities and qualifications via email to the identified POC no later than 3:00 pm EDT on 05 May 2010. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to the identified POC; oral communications will not be accepted in response to this notice. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the proper approach to fulfilling the referenced contractual requirement. The determination whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br /><br />NOTE: Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these services. No solicitation documents exist at this time and there is no anticipation of a solicitation issuance. Requests for a solicitation will not be entertained. The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information the Contractor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. <br />

<DESC>Please see the attached notice Sources Sought <br /><br />The following questions were received from industry regarding the OCC's&nbsp; needs.&nbsp; The answers are below:<br /><br />
<p>1) Does the OCC have a central payroll system? If not, with how many payroll centers will the TPA be required to interface? <br /><br />The OCC has one payroll provider and that is the National Finance Center located in New Orleans, LA.</p>
<p>2) Annually, what is the total number of payroll deduction data files that the OCC will exchange with the TPA? <br /><br />OCC employees are paid on a biweekly basis and the TPA would receive a payroll deduction data file each pay period. Therefore, it is anticipated that annually there would be 26 payroll deduction data files with Health Care and Dependent Care deduction transactions, however for the Parking FSA only 24 of those files will contain parking payroll deduction data (parking deductions are taken twice a month).</p>
<p>3) What are your expectations of the TPA with regard to enrollment meetings (if any) and the production and distribution of enrollment materials? <br /><br />At this time, the OCC is not firm as to its requirements regarding enrollment meetings. The FSA program is not new for the OCC; however, a change in TPA would be and may require some communications meetings in various formats, i.e., webinars, face-to-face, etc. Typically the OCC requires at least one annual face-to-face meeting and another meeting during open season at its headquarters location in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>4) Who is the incumbent FSA administrator? If at liberty to disclose, what is the current fee structure? <br /><br />The incumbent is Wageworks.&nbsp; We are not at liberty to currently disclose the fee structure.</p>
<p>5) How many participants do you have in the Medical FSA? Dependent Care FSA? Transportation FSA? <br /><br />Current participants in Health Care 1,759; Dependent Care participants 50; participants in both Health Care and Dependent Care 171; and Parking FSA participants 260.</p>

Offerors shall park in the public parking facility located at the Central Terminal of LaGuardia Airport, near American Airlines.  The ATCT is located right near the terminal outside of American Airlines.
The FAA has a requirement to purchase furniture for the new LaGuardia Air Traffic Control Tower at LaGuardia Airport, Flushing, NY per Section C specifications.
Purchase of Furniture with installation: The Offeror shall be responsible to provide labor, equipment, transportation, materials, and disposal of any and all old furniture and debris associated in order to furnish and install new furniture. Contractor shall submit materials for approval with RFQ proposal. At a minimum, submittals shall include product literature, MSDS, standard color, texture, fabric and style samples.
The Offeror will propose a price inclusive of materials for each CLIN and product line proposed. Delivery must be priced FOB destination.
Offers that are not able to meet the delivery requirements are not acceptable. The most important thing to accomplish is to meet the minimum requirements so that your offer will be deemed technically acceptable.
Estimated Cost of Purchase (includes design, installation, and product): 	      LGA ATCT:  $225,000.00 - $375,000.00
PURPOSE:
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Eastern Service Area is seeking qualified firms to provide furniture for the new LaGuardia Air Traffic Control Tower at LaGuardia Airport, Flushing, NY.  This acquisition is for UNICOR and vendors listed on GSA Schedule 71 (Furniture) with a distributor in the tri-state area and a local showroom within 100 miles or less of LaGuardia Airport, Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT).  Map Quest will be the only source used to determine distance.  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this effort is 337214: Office Furniture (except Wood) Manufacturing.  The qualification process will be based on the Evaluation Criteria stated in the SIR.  FAILURE TO PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION THAT IS REQUESTED BELOW FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES SHALL ELIMINATE THE OFFEROR FROM RECEIVING THE AWARD.
EVALUATION INFORMATION:
Each potential vendor will be evaluated on the information provided in response to this SIR.  Firms should ensure that the information provided is true and sufficiently complete so as not to be misleading nor require additional clarification.
Any proposal determined to be "not acceptable" in any evaluated area, criteria, or sub-element thereof, shall render the offer proposal to be unacceptable and therefore rejected from further consideration. The government may reject any and all proposals and waive informalities or irregularities in proposals. One-on-one discussions may be held, at the option of the Government, with one or more offerors, as determined necessary by the Contracting Officer, to clarify proposals, resolve issues and omissions, etc.
DRAWINGS:
Attachment #1, LGA Floor Plans, must be requested via email from Steven.jones@faa.gov with the subject line "DTFAEA-10-R-00003: Request for LGA Floor Plans".
BASIS FOR AWARD:
The Government will make an award to the responsive and responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous to the government, considering price, leasing terms, and other factors as stated below, conforms to the solicitation terms and conditions, and represents the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award on initial offers without discussions or to conduct one-on-one discussions with one or more offerors to clarify issues relating to scope, pricing and responsibility.  Furthermore, the government reserves the right to reject any or all offers and to waive minor irregularities and discrepancies in offers received.  The Government is seeking offers that provide the best combination of attributes and price in order to select the greatest or "best" value offer.  Therefore, award may be made to other than the lowest priced offer based on the criteria listed below as previously provided through the RFO. 
The FAA prefers that all response submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically on CD.  Offerors wishing to submit a proposal, modification or withdrawal through the U.S. Postal Service, Certified and Registered Mail, Special Delivery or U.S. Postal Express shall address correspondence to:

<DESC>Please see attached amendment: the due date for offers in response to this solicitation is hereby extended until 2:00 PM, EDST May 10,2010. A signed acknowledgement of this amendment must accompany all offers.
Background
The Federal Aviation Administration Engineering Development Services Navigation team (AJP-652) has been tasked with supporting the development of Category III (CAT III) avionics for the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS).  The Navigation Team requires the support of an avionics manufacturer in order to implement the use of additional messages and algorithms as described in RTCA DO-246D and DO-253C in a commercial platform.  The Navigation Team proposes the modification of a currently existing commercially available package in production or development.  
The Navigation Team, with guidance from the Satellite Program Office, AJW 432, has selected a commercial platform for this effort because air carriers are currently procuring and installing MultiMode receivers or other highly integrated avionics packages into their fleet aircraft.  The FAA currently utilizes similar receivers for use with LAAS in Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) data collection, Flight Inspection, and LAAS Ground Facility (LGF) tests.  
Objective
The objective of the contract is to supply the Navigation Team and LAAS program participants as identified by the SATNAV program office with red label (non-certified) equipment for use in requirements validation efforts.  These efforts include, but are not limited to data collection in conjunction with prototype CAT III ground equipment, TERPS testing, procedure development, LGF testing, and Flight Inspection requirements development.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION HAS BEEN REOPENED AND WILL BE ADVERTISED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION on April 21, 2010. 

THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS SOLICITATION IS BROUGHT FORWARD FROM PREVIOUS SOLICITATION NUMBER DTFH68-09-B-00036.

PROJECT DETAILS: The project is located within the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge, which is adjacent to the City of Lawton, Oklahoma and the Fort Sill Army Base. 

This project consists of the placement of fills on both sides of an existing 2-mile asphalt paved road (Six Mile Scenic Road) to provide additional width, and the construction of paved shoulders along both sides of the road. A double 10-foot by 5-foot concrete box culvert will be extended in place to match the new widths, along with the construction of new headwalls and wingwalls. Other circular metal culverts along the route will need to be extended. In order to perform the widening, both edges of the existing pavment must be saw cut along most of the length. Also included in the project are the replacement of guardrails and guardrail end terminals, grouted riprap at the culvert extensions, and the replacement of permanent signs. After the widening and paved shoulders are completed, the entire roadway surface will be treated with a 3/8-inch modified slurry seal.

In addition to the road work described above, a prefabricated single span steel pedestrian bridge, 140-feet in length, will be constructed at the Elk Mountain Campground area of the Refuge. Other work associated with the bridge construction includes the removal of an existing small pedestrian bridge in the same area, the placement of loose Class 5 riprap at the new bridge abutments, and the use of concrete formliner, which will be painted, on the bridge abutments. The deck of the new bridge will be poured and finished concrete.

Construction can be performed year-round. The project is anticipated to begin in late summer 2009, and should take six months to complete. The estimated price is between $1 and $2 million.

PLEASE NOTE: The Invitation for Bid are expected to be available for download on or after November 10, 2009, from the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fedbizopps.gov. PLANS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD IN ADOBE (.pdf) FORMAT ONLY ON CFLHD's WEBSITE at http://www.cflhd.gov/procurement/construction/advertised-projects.cfm under the Project Name. Other information regarding this solicitation will also be available at the above website. 

Technical questions specific to the project will only be addressed by FHWA via written correspondence to e-mail address CFLContracts@fhwa.dot.gov or FAX to (720) 963-3360.

b)	Copies of the park's individual service and respective charges shall be faxed to the CO or designated representative.
c)	The COR will be responsible for checking the invoice against Contract requirements and verify service items indicated on the invoice.  If service was not delivered or incorrectly invoiced, the COR will document in writing the discrepancies and will forward to the CO within 5 working days from the date the COR received the invoice.
d)	If the respective COR does not contact the CO within 5 working days, it will be assumed the invoice is correct and has been approved by the COR.  The COR will retain copies of the approved invoice for their records and for future reference if questions should arise.

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>In the prospectus issued February 9, 2010, the National Park Service ("Service") advised it would respond to questions about the prospectus if submitted in writing and received by March 12, 2010.  The Service later extended that date to March 26, 2010.  The Service received a number of questions timely and responds to those questions with the exception of several questions for which the Service still is developing responses.  The Service anticipates the remainder of the questions will be answered on or around May 7, 2010.
1.	The prospectus makes several mentions of an attachment H-2 in the business opportunity and the draft maintenance plan, but the attachment does not appear to be included in the prospectus package. Since this is described as an itemization of deferred maintenance projects that could have significant impacts on the operations and financials.  Can this attachment H-2 document be made available to bidders?
Response - As stated in the prospectus: "The Service will provide a list of specific required deferred maintenance projects and applicable completion dates in Attachment 2 to the Maintenance Plan (Exhibit H of the Draft Contract). This Attachment 2 to Exhibit H (Specific Required Deferred Maintenance Projects) will be part of the Draft Contract when forwarded to the selected Offeror for contract execution." As disclosed on page 25 of the Business Opportunity under the Deferred Maintenance section, the Service anticipates that most of the deferred maintenance needs will qualify as component renewal projects which may, with Service approval, be funded from available Repair and Maintenance Reserve expenditures.  
2.	The estimate of required initial investment includes $153,000 in "other start up" expenses. Can bidders be provided with information on what this includes? Does this amount include any of the required deferred maintenance items referred to below?
Response- "Other Start-up" costs represent the estimated working capital required for start-up.  This amount does not include any of the required deferred maintenance items. 
3.	The prospectus indicates that the current concessioner operated 79 guestrooms. On page 18 of the Business Opportunity section, the required services under the new contract would seem to authorize the concessioner to operate 75 to 79 rooms. Is this correct? Also, is NPS responsible for the removal of the four decommissioned cabins?
Response - Yes, the Draft Contract authorizes the concessioner to operate up to 79 rooms.  The Service will remove the cabins.
4.	The prospectus refers to "a list of specific required deferred maintenance projects and applicable completion dates in Attachment 2 to the Maintenance Plan (Exhibit H of the Draft Contract)." This list (Attachment H-2) does not appear to be included in the prospectus package. Can it be provided to bidders?
Response - See response to Question 1.
5.	The Draft Operating Plan [3-C (1) (b)] stipulates that "all concession facilities must meet applicable codes" and be outfitted with "appropriate" fire detection and suppression equipment. Can an explanation be provided on how this applies/does not apply to older concession buildings? Can a structural fire report be provided to bidders?   
Response- Please refer to Director's Order 58. A structural fire report does not exist for the concession facilities assigned to the Draft Contract.
6.	Is more detailed information available on the condition of autos, trucks and boats?
Response - The Service does not have more detailed information than what is presented in the Personal Property List provided in the Appendices.
7.	What is the maximum number of concession employees that the incumbent houses in the assigned 52 dormitory rooms during peak season?
Response -Page 17 of the Business Opportunity addresses employee housing.  The Service does not know the maximum number of employees that the incumbent concessioner houses in the dormitory during peak season.
8.	Appendix E of the Prospectus sets forth the historical water, sewer, and trash expenditures from 2003 through 2007 related to Signal Mountain Lodge. What other utilities (e.g., electrical, fuel oil, gas, propane, etc.) were utilized by Signal Mountain Lodge facilities over the same time period and what were the historical expenditures related to such additional utilities?
Response -The Service does not have the historical expenditures information on the types of utilities included in this question, although it does know that the current operation uses them.  
9.	The Business Opportunity section of the Prospectus addresses the planned removal of four (4) cabins at the start of the new contract term (see page IS). Can you please clarify the number of bedrooms that currently exist in each of these cabins?  
Response - Each cabin has one bedroom.  Total pillow count is 11. 
10.	The Business Opportunity section of the Prospectus states that the current concessioner reports revenue earned at the Leeks Marina Pizzeria as part of marina revenues (in addition to revenues earned from boat rentals and guided lake fishing tours). Can you please provide either a detailed breakdown of the revenues related to the Leeks Marina operation or, at a minimum, an estimate of what percentage of such operation's revenues are related to food and beverage sales? 
Response - The Service does not have a detailed breakdown of the revenues at Leeks Marina and is not able to provide any additional information in regard to those revenues.
16.	 Page 15 of the Business Opportunity, addressing Lodging Services, explains that the NPS has determined that one building comprised of four cabin units is in irreparable condition and will be removed, reducing the number of lodging units to 75 at the start of the new Contract.  Page B-16 of Exhibit B (Draft Operating Plan) to the Draft Contract, however, states that the Maximum Required Inventory for Signal Mountain Lodge is "75-79 units, 352-363 pillows."
(a) Will NPS please provide a more detailed plan and timeline for removal of the four cabins? 
Response - The Service intends to remove the units from service prior to the effective date of the new contract.  Demolition of the units may be delayed depending on the timeline of the Determination of Eligibility study mentioned in the response to Question #19 (below).
(b) The Developmental Concept Plan for Signal Mountain Lodge contemplates 79 lodging units, consistent with the number of units authorized under the existing contract. Page B-16 of the Draft Operating Plan further appears to contemplate the possibility of a total of 79 lodging units. Will NPS allow the reconstruction of the four lodging units? If not, will NPS please explain its rationale for not authorizing the replacement of the four cabin units on the site of the older cabins, restoring the number of lodging units back to the current level of 79 units, including how this decision affects the achievement of the "Service Objectives" of providing affordable, comfortable overnight accommodations" and the Service's desire to have the Concessioner "maintain a stratified price range and type of accommodations" (Subfactor 2a)? 
Response - The Draft Contract authorizes the concessioner to operate up to the 79 units allowed for in the Developmental Concept Plan.  The Service will consider replacement of the units, consistent with all the parameters of the Contract.  The Service will not approve a project to replace the four units that incurs Leasehold Surrender Interest.  The current location of the four units has significant drainage and landscape problems.  The Service believes the concessioner can provide affordable, comfortable overnight accommodations while maintaining a stratified price range and type of accommodations using the remaining inventory of cabins.
(c) In the event that the four lodging units are not to be reconstructed, in calculating the return to the concessioner under the new contract, did the NPS consider the impact of the reduction in revenues due to the demolition of the four lodging units? If so, please explain what the NPS determined to be the extent of that impact (including any estimate of loss of revenue to the concessioner), as well as any assumptions used by the NPS in making that determination.  
Response - Yes, the financial feasibility analysis took into account the loss of revenue due to the demolition of the four lodging units.   While one might expect the occupancy percentage to rise slightly due to the smaller number of rooms, the Service assumed an approximate 5% decrease in the number of annual occupied rooms in our analysis to determine the minimum franchise fee.  This decrease reflected, in part, the loss of the four rooms.
17.	 Page 25 of the Business Opportunity document explains that, "To determine the specific maintenance needs of the Concession Facilities under the Draft Contract, including deferred maintenance, the Service contracted for a new comprehensive condition assessment that commenced during the fall of 2009" and references "preliminary findings." The NPS further states that it "will provide a list of specific required deferred maintenance projects and applicable completion dates in Attachment 2 to the Maintenance Plan (Exhibit H of the Draft Contract)," which "will be part of the Draft Contract when forwarded to the selected Offeror for contract execution." Similarly, section 10(c)(1) of the Draft Contract, page 14, states: "Repair and Maintenance Reserve projects will include both deferred and non-deferred maintenance. With respect to deferred maintenance, a Specific Required Deferred Maintenance Projects list, which is Attachment 2 to the Maintenance Plan, identifies, prioritizes, and provides the Concessioner with a schedule for curing deferred maintenance. The Concessioner must complete the projects as set forth in Attachment 2." Additional information relating to deferred and non-deferred maintenance is essential to enable potential bidders to assess the scope and extent of the maintenance obligations under the new contract. In this regard:
(a) Will NPS please provide the final results of the Facility Condition Assessment showing the individual projects, NPS prioritization, projected/estimated cost, and completion dates for each project? If the final results are not yet available, will NPS please provide the preliminary findings of the Assessment? 
Response - The condition assessment is not finalized and the Service will not release preliminary findings.  The Service will include Attachment 2 to Exhibit H (Specific Required Deferred Maintenance Projects) as part of the Draft Contract when forwarded to the selected Offeror for contract execution.  As disclosed on page 25 of the Business Opportunity under the Deferred Maintenance section, the Service anticipates that most of the deferred maintenance needs will qualify as component renewal projects, which may, with Service approval, be funded from available Repair and Maintenance Reserve expenditures.  
(b) Will NPS please provide a list of specific required deferred maintenance projects with applicable completion dates that will become Attachment 2 to Exhibit H, the Maintenance Plan of the Draft Contract? 
Response -Please see the response to Question 1 above.
(c) Will NPS please provide a list of any known non-deferred maintenance projects that the new concessioner will be required to complete under the new contract? 
Response - The only non-deferred maintenance projects known at this time are component renewal projects that will be funded through the repair and maintenance reserve.
(d) If NPS will not provide the specific information requested in (a), (b), and (c), what is the basis and rationale for not providing this information, as the NPS has provided this information on other Prospectus Solicitations, including, for example, Solicitation CC-OLYM003-10 and CC-HAVO001-l0?
Response -At this time, the Service does not have the final Comprehensive Condition Assessment and will not release preliminary findings.
(e) Will NPS authorize a Project Management Fee to the Concessioner for Reserve Account Projects managed by the Concessioner? 
Response - No
18.	The first page of Part B of the Proposal Package states that "Offerors must use normal sized font, such as 11 or 12 point, and 1 inch margins on all sides, in the body of the proposal. Tables, charts, graphs, provided forms, and copies of sample material using less than 11 point font is acceptable." Will the NPS accept a font smaller than 11 point for the Financial Pro Formas (Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, Investment Form, associated assumptions and supporting documentation)? 
Response - The Service will not accept a font smaller than 10 point for the Financial Pro Formas.
19.	With respect to Exhibit D to the Draft Contract, page D-l, please clarify that the only Assigned Real Property Improvements that are Historic are those buildings designated by FMMS Codes 89914 and 89917. 
Response - The only assets currently included on the List of Classified Structures (LCS) are 89914 and 89917.  However, the Service plans to complete a Determination of Eligibility (DOE) within the next two years to review the Signal Mountain area and buildings for historical significance.  Findings from the DOE will determine whether additional buildings from Exhibit D should be submitted for inclusion on the LCS.  
20.	With respect to Exhibit D to the Draft Contract, page D-l, please provide the Facility Condition Assessment Rating for each of the listed Real Property Improvements. 
Response - The Service does not have "Facility Condition Assessment Ratings" for the Concession Facilities listed on Exhibit D.
21.	In the Proposal Package Files (Excel Forms), the Proposal Package File for the Income Statement (specifically direct expenses) is based on a department (line of business basis) total expense and not by detailed direct expense line items (e.g., payroll, R & M, utilities, etc.). Historically, the NPS's Intermountain Region has used the detailed direct expense template, for example for Grand Canyon North Rim, Zion, and Bryce Canyon.
Will NPS approve the use of the Income Statement Template which details the direct expenses in lieu of the Proposal Package Template? 
Response - No, the Service will not approve the use of an alternate format.  Use the format presented in the Proposal Package Files.
22.	The Draft Operating Plan [5-B (1) (b)] states, "No more than 25 sites at Signal MountainCampground will have electrical, sewer and water hookups." How many campsites currentlyhave electric, sewer & water service?  
Response - There is currently one site with electric, water and sewer hookups. 
23.	A significant amount of Total Revenue is categorized as "Other Revenue." What was Total Service Station Revenue for 2006 - 2008?  
Response - Service Station Revenue is included in Retail Revenue in Exhibit 23 of the Business Opportunity section of the Prospectus.   
Auto Fuel Sales:2006: $252,267 - 4% of Gross Receipts2007: $302,391 - 5% of Gross Receipts2008: $303,641 - 5% of Gross Receipts

<DESC>This announcement serves as notice of the publication of the WPS program Solicitation.  As stated in the synopsis, interested parties shall address all questions and other communications to the Contracting Officer. 

Contracting Officer: Thomas C. Lemole
email: LemoleTC@State.Gov  
phone: 1-703-875-5852


This notice addresses a typographical error included on page 3, paragraph 3 of the synopsis that states: within three (5) days.  The text now correctly states: within five (5) days.  

NOTICE OF PROPOSED SOLICITATION

Worldwide Protective Services (WPS)

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ) to up to six (6) qualified U.S. firms.  DOS anticipates issuing Task and Delivery Orders under the IDIQ comprised of labor hour / day rate, firm-fixed price, and cost-reimbursement components.  
This IDIQ will satisfy anticipated and unanticipated personal protective, static guard, and emergency response team security service requirements worldwide. The IDIQ focuses primarily on DOS requirements in critical or higher than critical threat areas. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four, one-year option periods (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). The NAICS code for these services is 561612. 
At a minimum, offerors must possess ALL of the following listed below: 

A.	A valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission for the base contract. If a firm with a valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance is selected for award of the base contract, the Government will sponsor that firm for the Top Secret Facility Clearance. However, if for whatever reason, within 60 days of contract award, the firm has not been granted an Interim Top Secret Facility Security Clearance, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract. Similarly, if for whatever reason, within 120 days of contract award, a final Top Secret Facility Security Clearance has not been granted to the contractor, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract.; and

B.	Have at least two years of experience in managing and operating personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security services programs located in austere and hostile environments overseas (i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc); and

C.	Personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security programs must have a total annual value of at least 15 million dollars; and

D.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating guard forces with at least 100 positions (posts) at each location, in multiple locations (different facilities, cities, states, regions, etc.); and

E.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating long term personal protective security details for executive level dignitaries; and

F.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating emergency response teams comprised of at least four members.

The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirements contained in the statement of work for each task order awarded under the IDIQ contract. All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass background investigations conducted separately by the Contractor and the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. Depending on position, all prime and subcontractor employees performing on this contract must possess either a personnel security clearance or a moderate-risk public trust certification, or have been vetted by the Regional Security Office at the U.S. Embassy where performance is requested (for instance U.S. Embassy Baghdad or Kabul).  Firms that are not eligible for a facility security clearance are NOT ELIGIBLE for award of this contract as the prime contractor, nor can they be selected as a subcontractor if the positions require a personnel security clearance for contract performance.     

SPECIAL NOTES: 

1) All International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other legal requirements shall be met at the time of contract award.  DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract of a company that is not ITAR compliant.  Contractors shall submit proof of ITAR compliance at the time of contract award; and 

2) DOS reserves the right to reject the proposal of any Offeror that the Government of Iraq or Afghanistan deems ineligible for a Private Security Contractor license, or that is ineligible for any reason to operate as a Private Security Contractor in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Contractors shall submit proof of their legal ability to perform in any country where they are awarded work.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule

DOS plans to post the complete Request for Proposal to www.fbo.gov approximately fifteen (15) days after this notice, no paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted, offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit a proposal for the IDIQ contract award along with four (4) task order proposals consisting of three (3) operational programs and a local program management office.  The three operational programs include: a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Baghdad, Iraq, a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Kabul, Afghanistan, and a personal protective security service requirement in Jerusalem.  DOS intends to award LPMO Task Orders concurrently to firms that are selected for award of an operational task order.  Offerors who do not submit proposals for the IDIQ and all the Task Orders will not be considered by the Government for award. Offerors will also be required to submit a completely separate proposal detailing expenses to establish an LPMO in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Under this multiple award IDIQ contract, all offerors receiving awards SHALL propose 100% of the time on all task and delivery order requirements throughout the life of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to terminate any contractor for default who fail to conform to this requirement. DOS anticipates contract award approximately sixty (60) to seventy-five (75) days after submission of proposals. As such, offerors shall certify that all proposals SHALL NOT EXPIRE for a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days after submission to the Government. 

The Question and Answer (Q &A) period opens with the posting of the solicitation (and not before). The Government will allow interested parties to submit questions to the Government up to April 23, 2010; 1:30 PM EDT after the solicitation is issued. DOS intends to address as many of the industry questions as possible during the pre-proposal conference. DOS will post the answers to any questions not addressed during the pre-proposal conference via www.fbo.gov at a later date.

<DESC>A. General Information.<BR>The Pacific Region Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) Region 12 announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Surgical Prep Clippers W/Single Use Blades.      <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the regions based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a clinically preferred product and source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program. As a clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical criteria <BR>plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Selection will be based clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade-off criteria.<BR><BR>The major Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Pacific Region, TRBO Region 12 area include but are not limited to Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, MEDDAC-K Seoul, 374th Medical Group Yokota Air Base, 18th Medical Group Kadena Air Base. <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program, Cardinal Health. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three one-year (12 months) option periods. Anticipated selection date is July 2010.  Products and vendors that pass the technical criteria and pass the clinical performance expectations will be considered clinically preferred products and sources.  Among these clinically preferred products and sources price will be the determining factor for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF clinical preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Mary Summers, TRBO Technical Director <BR>808-433-3686, mary.summers1@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

<DESC><strong>The following questions and answers are added as amendment 1.<br /><br />Question: a. Timeline</strong> <br />We understand the eligibility statement must be in by 1300, Tuesday May 04. You pre-solicitation also states, "Eligibility companies may retrieve a solicitation package at a designated time and place in the Washington DC area weekdays between 8 AM on Tuesday April 27 and 1 PM on Friday May 7." <br />Therefore, does this mean we may pick up the solicitation package before our eligibility statement is submitted? <br />Or does it mean, we can submit our eligibility statement prior to 27 April, pass the eligibility statement and then pick up the solicitation package after notification? <br />If so, how and when will we be notified that we can pick up the solicitation package?
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Eligibility statements will be reviewed throughout the time period beginning with the April 19 posting through Tuesday May 04 at 1 PM EST. Expect a 24 to 48 hour period for the eligibility to be reviewed; you will receive an email confirmation of your submission and then an email concerning your eligibility. A solicitation package may only be retrieved by an eligible company so you will need to submit your eligibility statement prior to any retrieval. Should your company be found eligible, the email will then explain how you are to retrieve the solicitation package.</p>
<p><strong>Question: b. Constraints <br /></strong>Your pre-solicitation states, "This requirement requires access to classified databases." <br />Are we correct in understanding that this statement refers to the actual execution of the task and NOT the proposal and NOT the eligibility statement? <br />Can we assume that our courier will ALSO have to drop off our proposal?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The successful awardee's personnel are required to have TS/SCI because they will have access to classified databases. The eligibility statement shall be sent via unclassified email; the Solicitation package is classified as Secret and does not require access to classified databases. The solicitation package will detail proposal submission instructions to include courier drop off as well as the possibility of other methods for submitting a proposal (such as delivery by an unclassified courier or postal mail). Each company will need to determine if their proposal should be classified as Secret (please remember that all proposals are treated as source selection sensitive).</p>

<DESC><strong>Question:</strong> If a company desires to submit a Request for Offer and does not currently have TS clearance but are willing and desire to obtain one. However this company has one member on their staff that does have TS clearance, is the company eligible to submit a bid? <br /><strong>Answer:</strong> The first eligibility factor is: the company must possess a valid CAGE (Commercial And Government Entity) code in the Industrial Security Facilities Database. Without the secure facility, this company will not receive the Solicitation.
<p><strong>Question:</strong> If this company would like to outsource the writing of their 5-page documentation, does the procurement writing team need to have TS clearance? Each member of the procurement team has cleared E-Verify and has had a background check performed by DHS. Would this team be eligible to write the RFO? <br /><strong>Answer:</strong> Cleared personnel at the TS/SCI level will be required of the successful awardee. There are no personnel classification level requirements for writing the eligibility statement or responding to the Solicitation. For outsourcing the writing: the company holding the valid CAGE and having the ability to receive Secret information must maintain the Solicitation package; there is no check on who writes.</p>

<DESC>This is a firm fixed-price type of contract for the repair of a roof on a building at U.S. Consulate General, Frankfurt, Germany. The roof was damaged on February 28, 2010 by the storm &lsquo;Cynthia' which raged over Germany with gusts over 160 km/h. The bituminous roofing material of the building was peeled off and back over an area of approximately 250 sqm. The roof insulation was exposed to wind and weather; sheet metal gutter inlets, roof vents and the lightening protection were damaged and/or destroyed, and the insulation was soaked.
<p>In an emergency repair aimed at preventing further damage to the roof as well as protecting the public, the roofing material had to be cut back to where it was not yet damaged and removed. The wet insulation material was also removed. The vapor barrier had to be repaired where the bathroom vents were ripped out. Patches were installed to prevent rainwater from flowing into the holes. However, the emergency repair was decidedly a short-term solution: the storm uncovered that the existing thermal insulation and thus also the roof membrane is not mechanically glued or fixed to the roof slab. The next storm could take the rest of the roof off.</p>
<p>Over one-third of the roof surface still does not drain into the gutters; it simply drains over the edge. Where the roof vents were ripped out, there are still holes. Draining rainwater just doesn't flow into the holes. Last of all, this area no longer has any thermal insulation.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, and in keeping with FAR 603.1 (d), post obtained three bids from three responsible, specialist roofing companies in an effort to speed up the actual roof repair. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2); the regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-2.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. 52.212-5  Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive OrdersCommercial Items.  (a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). ___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). (2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (Aug 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). (3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (Oct 2004) (Pub.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6, Other That Full and Open Competition, FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 3 intends to modify Contract No. EP-R3-05-01 with Four Seasons Environmental, Inc., for continuation of existing operation and maintenance services in support of Region 3's laboratory facility.
<p>The planned contract action represents a two-month "new work" extension of the contract, effective April 1, 2010 through May 31, 2010, and an additional two-month option period. The modification is necessary in order to ensure continuity of critical operational services at the EPA Region 3 laboratory. Award of the contracts has been delayed, which has necessitated that the above existing contract be extended until these awards can be made. <br />It is in the best interest of the Government to extend the existing contract pending award of the follow-on contracts, which are currently under evaluation. <br />This notice is not a request for proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Written inquiries or comments regarding this announcement may be emailed to Alexandra Rajkowski-Reyes at rajkowski-reyes.alexandra@epa.gov.</p>

(formerly Arrowhead Global Solutions, Inc. and now a subsidiary of CapRock Communications), ARTEL Inc. (small disadvantaged business) and DRS Technical Services, Inc. (DRS-TSI) (formerly Spacelink International LLC) on 16 February 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current combined ceiling of the three DSTS-G contracts is $2.196 if all options are exercised.

<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consistent with DISA's Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) recommendation, <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">(Deleted Text)</strong> set-asides will be established which will give small business a significant opportunity to be part of a procurement of this magnitude. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If small businesses receive awards for both Full and Open and Small Business ID/IQ requirements, they will receive two separate contracts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in an effort to remove all possible barriers to competition, an additional layer of competition will be available on the IT Schedule 70 by means of a continuous enrollment process providing opportunity for new vendors to compete for requirements; and, the ID/IQ contracts will only have a period of performance of a 3-year base with 2, 1-year options.</p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The DSTS-G contracts DCA200-01-D-500(2-4) (3 year base period with seven (7) 1-year options) were originally competitively awarded as a small business set-aside to three providers: CapRock Government Solutions, Inc. (formerly Arrowhead Global Solutions, Inc. and now a subsidiary of CapRock Communications), ARTEL Inc. (small disadvantaged business) and DRS Technical Services, Inc. (DRS-TSI) (formerly Spacelink International LLC) on 16 February 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current combined ceiling of the three DSTS-G contracts is $2.196 if all options are exercised. Total estimated DSTS-G expenditures to date are approximately $1.46B and are projected to increase to $2.15B by 15 Feb 2011 when the original contract period of performance ends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cost requirements of the DSTS-G extension total $451.9M and increase total estimated DSTS-G lifecycle contract requirements to $2.60B, necessitating an increase to the DSTS-G ceiling of $407.8M.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contracts were awarded to support DoD's FSS requirements and support transmission of critical command, control, and intelligence information in a crisis or national emergency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These extensions are essential to DoD providing services without interruption until the award and transition to the Future COMSATCOM Services Acquisition (FCSA) contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To avoid disruption of vital warfighter services, DSTS-G contracts must be extended for one year with two six-month options.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Per Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 239.7405 Delegated Authority for Telecommunications Resources, there is a ten year limitation on the lifespan of a telecommunication contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, this sole source J&amp;A is required to allow DoD to continue providing the necessary communications capabilities without interruption.</p>

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Establishing a meaningful role for small business participation.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Acquisition Strategy prepared by DISA has evolved significantly during staffing and review to ensure the recommended multiple award, targeted scope approach will deliver contracts that can satisfy existing and emerging customer requirements, provides significant opportunities for small business, and satisfies the DoD Acquisition of Services policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While DISA was able to award the DSTS-G contract vehicle as a small business set-aside in 2001, in recent years the volume and complexity of COMSATCOM has significantly increased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whereas in the past, DoD primarily needed point-to-point or point-to-multipoint fixed COMSATCOM solutions, DoD's needs have shifted to include highly complex Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) networks, portable solutions, occasional use solutions, unmanned aerial vehicles, etc. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Many of these needs are spread across the globe. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The growth in business levels and complexity alone makes it unlikely for small business (under North American Industry Classification System [NAICS] code 517410-Satellite Telecommunications) to adequately meet the full scope of DoD demands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Market research results from the February 2008 RFI/Sources Sought and the March 2008 Industry Days supported this position, revealing that no small businesses could take on the entire scope of work; however, small businesses do have the capacity to satisfy some categories of service requirements, making it practical to set aside some portion of the work exclusively for small business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consistent with DISA's Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) recommendation, <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">(Deleted Text)</strong> set-asides will be established which will give small business a significant opportunity to be part of a procurement of this magnitude. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If small businesses receive awards for both Full and Open and Small Business ID/IQ requirements, they will receive two separate contracts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in an effort to remove all possible barriers to competition, an additional layer of competition will be available on the IT Schedule 70 by means of a continuous enrollment process providing opportunity for new vendors to compete for requirements; and, the ID/IQ contracts will only have a period of performance of a 3-year base with 2, 1-year options.</p>

(formerly Arrowhead Global Solutions, Inc. and now a subsidiary of CapRock Communications), ARTEL Inc. (small disadvantaged business) and DRS Technical Services, Inc. (DRS-TSI) (formerly Spacelink International LLC) on 16 February 2001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current combined ceiling of the three DSTS-G contracts is $2.196 if all options are exercised. Total estimated DSTS-G expenditures to date are approximately $1.46B and are projected to increase to $2.15B by 15 Feb 2011 when the original contract period of performance ends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cost requirements of the DSTS-G extension total $451.9M and increase total estimated DSTS-G lifecycle contract requirements to $2.60B, necessitating an increase to the DSTS-G ceiling of $407.8M.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contracts were awarded to support DoD's FSS requirements and support transmission of critical command, control, and intelligence information in a crisis or national emergency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These extensions are essential to DoD providing services without interruption until the award and transition to the Future COMSATCOM Services Acquisition (FCSA) contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To avoid disruption of vital warfighter services, DSTS-G contracts must be extended for one year with two six-month options.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Per Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 239.7405 Delegated Authority for Telecommunications Resources, there is a ten year limitation on the lifespan of a telecommunication contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, this sole source J&amp;A is required to allow DoD to continue providing the necessary communications capabilities without interruption.</p>

Further evaluation of these contracts concluded that no individual DoD contract meets the terms, conditions and set of attributes described in Section 3.1 of the DSTS-G PWS. For example, although the TIGER contract can provide satellite equipment and associated services, its primary focus is to provide information technology, security, productivity consulting, drafting/design, facilities/installation management, public safety, and geographic information systems (GIS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the TIGER contract was awarded in 2005 as a 4-year base contract with three 2-year options and has a ceiling of $689 million.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the primary purpose of WWSS is to provide satellite terminals and associated engineering services, not COMSATCOM service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although WWSS has a $5 billion ceiling, it expires in 2011. TROJAN/IEW supports the procurement, engineering, installation, and maintenance of COMSATCOM services for the TROJAN/IEW communications systems, with a ceiling of $286 million, but was not established to support the magnitude and diversity of requirements inherent in a multi-billion dollar DoD-wide acquisition of services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, DISA also evaluated SATCOM II.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Market research conducted by DISA showed that bandwidth prices were around 20% higher on SATCOM II as compared to DSTS-G.

<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Acquisition Strategy prepared by DISA has evolved significantly during staffing and review to ensure the recommended multiple award, targeted scope approach will deliver contracts that can satisfy existing and emerging customer requirements, provides significant opportunities for small business, and satisfies the DoD Acquisition of Services policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While DISA was able to award the DSTS-G contract vehicle as a small business set-aside in 2001, in recent years the volume and complexity of COMSATCOM has significantly increased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Whereas in the past, DoD primarily needed point-to-point or point-to-multipoint fixed COMSATCOM solutions, DoD's needs have shifted to include highly complex Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) networks, portable solutions, occasional use solutions, unmanned aerial vehicles, etc. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Many of these needs are spread across the globe. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The growth in business levels and complexity alone makes it unlikely for small business (under North American Industry Classification System [NAICS] code 517410-Satellite Telecommunications) to adequately meet the full scope of DoD demands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Market research results from the February 2008 RFI/Sources Sought and the March 2008 Industry Days supported this position, revealing that no small businesses could take on the entire scope of work; however, small businesses do have the capacity to satisfy some categories of service requirements, making it practical to set aside some portion of the work exclusively for small business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consistent with DISA's Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) recommendation, <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">(Deleted Text)</strong> set-asides will be established which will give small business a significant opportunity to be part of a procurement of this magnitude. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If small businesses receive awards for both Full and Open and Small Business ID/IQ requirements, they will receive two separate contracts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, in an effort to remove all possible barriers to competition, an additional layer of competition will be available on the IT Schedule 70 by means of a continuous enrollment process providing opportunity for new vendors to compete for requirements; and, the ID/IQ contracts will only have a period of performance of a 3-year base with 2, 1-year options.</p>
