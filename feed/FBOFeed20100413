In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(i), All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 

Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

This NVESD effort is in support of the Focal Plane Array (FPA) Initiative to solicit proposals for the Vital Infrared Sensor Technology Acceleration (VISTA) program searching for innovative approaches for infrared focal plane arrays to enhance sensor capabilities.  The primary focus of the program is in III-V epitaxial materials research such as superlattice (SL) and nBn structures for advanced infrared FPAs with large-formats and reduced pixel size that are capable of mid- wavelength / long-wavelength infrared (MWIR/LWIR) detection.  In addition, the program will also investigate novel analog and all digital-in-the-pixel approaches for advanced read-out integrated circuits (ROICs) required to demonstrate large-format, reduced pixel size infrared FPAs. This is a two-phase program. The period for phase I is 3 years and the period for phase II is 2 years. The BAA will address Phase I only.  Industry is encouraged to provide feedback on the availability of products and services that meet the requirements outlined the draft BAA and the Industry Day.<BR><BR>The Draft BAA includes more details on innovations being sought and is available on the Interactive Business Opportunities Page at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil under CECOM-BAAs W909MY-10-R-0006. <BR><BR>An Industry Day will be held at the Hilton located in Springfield, VA, on Thursday, 29 April 2010 with a general session for all participants followed by individual-company sessions.  An additional day, 30 April 2010, has been scheduled in the event that more time is necessary to accommodate a heavy volume of participants.  The purpose of this event is to facilitate exchange between the Government and Industry on the VISTA program and requirements.  Comments and questions on the VISTA BAA will be sought from industry.  The purpose of the individual sessions is to provide a forum for industry representatives to discuss or brief Government personnel on their capabilities and enable the Government to receive information about industry research efforts and technology advances.  Time with individual industry representatives will be scheduled in advance with the Contracting Officer and is limited to one 1-hour session.  Industry may request a one-one-session by checking the radio button on the electronic registration tool or by contacting CCCE-W by email.  <BR><BR>Attendance at Industry Day is voluntary and is not required to submit a proposal.

<RESPDATE>060110

<DESC>The US Department of Education anticipates the release of the subject solicitation on or about April 28, 2010. The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) at the U.S. Department of Education (ED) has a requirement to design and conduct data collections for the first and second grade years of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11. The main purpose of this evaluation is to yield policy-relevant information by 1) providing current data on kindergarteners and their progress through the elementary grades, 2) providing data relevant to emerging policy-related domains not fully measured in the prior datasets, and 3) allowing for cross-cohort comparisons of the educational experiences of children attending school before and after the advent of new federal laws and policies. The period of performance is 54 months.
<p>The following summarizes the primary activities covered by this performance work statement (PWS): 1) recruit students, families, and schools in order to continue following the progress of the cohort as it moves from kindergarten through first and second grade; 2) finish developing a parent, teacher, and school administrator questionnaire for the first grade collection, and develop parent, teacher, and school administrator questionnaires for second grade; 3) field test the nonassessment instruments; 4) plan and conduct the first and second grade (spring 2012 and spring 2013) data collections; 5) create data files and documentation for the kindergarten through second-grade data; and 6) update child locating information (e.g. home address and telephone number, last school attended) annually to allow students to be traced over time.</p>
<p>The ECLS-K:2011 will collect data about the child and the child's school, classroom, teacher, and family. These data shall be collected directly from the child, the child's parents/guardians, teachers, and school administrators. In the kindergarten year, data also will be collected from children's regular before- and after-school care providers. The ECLS-K:2011 will directly assess children in reading, mathematics, and executive functioning, as well as measure height and weight. The inclusion of a direct science assessment is being evaluated for the kindergarten through second grade waves of the study. Science assessments will become part of the core study starting in third grade if they cannot be included in the earlier collections. The methods of data collection will include computer assisted 2-stage adaptive testing of children to allow comparability with ECLS-K:1998-99, paper and pencil questionnaires, and computer assisted telephone and in-person interviews (CAI). The ECLS-K:2011 begins with a cohort of kindergartners (and their parents, teachers, and schools) as they start school in the fall of 2010. A follow-up data collection will occur for the cohort at the end of the kindergarten school year, in the spring of 2011. A subsample of the cohort will be re-contacted in the fall of 2011 as they enter first grade. Re-contacts with the full sample will occur every spring thereafter through 2016, when most of the cohort will be completing fifth grade.</p>
<p>This contract, the second of the ECLS-K:2011 contracts, focuses on the national data collection for the springs of the first- and second-grade years. Apart from fielding the first- and second-grade collections, this contract also covers the release of the resulting data. In addition, this contract includes work to field test parent, teacher, and school administrator questionnaires for the first and second grade collections. It also includes work to track children from kindergarten into first grade and from first grade into second grade. There are several options to the contract including an option for a fall second grade data collection and an option for state sample augmentation.</p>
<p>Work from the first ECLS-K:2011 contract will necessarily play a central role in this, the second ECLS-K:2011 contract. As noted, the first contract focused on collecting data from the cohort during their kindergarten year (2010-11), the fall of their first grade year (fall 2011), and the design and evaluation of reading, math, and science assessments for the cohort's kindergarten-, first grade-, and second grade-years. Drafts of the first grade parent, teacher, and school administrator questionnaires are also currently under development. As such, items for the academic assessments for the first and second grade collections, and drafts of the parent, teacher, and school administrator first grade instruments will be provided to the contractor by NCES at the outset of this, the second ECLS-K:2011 contract. The contractor will need to finalize the first-grade parent, teacher, and school administrator instruments and field test them, and also fully develop the second grade parent, teacher, and school administrator instruments including field testing.</p>
<p><br />The contractor shall employ procedures, instruments, and questionnaire items similar to those used in the ECLS-K:1998-99, the ECLS-B, and the kindergarten collections of the ECLS-K:2011, with updates as necessary. Information about these studies can be found on the NCES web site at http://nces.ed.gov/ecls. All activities under this contract shall be completed and delivered within 54 months of the award date. <br /><br />The base contract is for 54 months, there are eleven options at ED's discretion that will not extend the contract.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number:

10-223-SOL-00082  Presolicitation

Notice Type:

Presolicitation

Synopsis:

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals under solicitation number 10-223-SOL-00082 (subject to change) for a program called the FDA Data Management Program (DMP).  The NAICS Code is 518210 with a small business size standard of $25 million.  

Project Background:

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of all FDA regulated products such as human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, food and dietary supplements, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. For each respective Center within FDA, legislation is set forth for voluntary and mandatory reporting of adverse events, product problems or complaints, and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) as cited in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act and other laws affecting the FDA. FDA receives these reports by electronic submission, mail, phone, fax, email, and via the internet. FDA requires support services for data entry and processing received reports. The key source of data entry includes Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs).1 These ICSRs are submitted to each Center in various formats. Currently, each Center has individual programs in place for supporting these legislative mandates and their respective missions. This contract shall provide the opportunity and means to align the individual Center programs with the Agency goal of a Unified Adverse Event Data Management Program, hereafter referred to as the Data Management Program (DMP). 

The FDA Centers missions and legislative authorization are presented below for FDA regulated products:

The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the FDA Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research (CBER) perform a crucial part of FDA's mission, pre-market and post-market safety and efficacy assessments of human drugs and biological products. The collection and analysis of reports by FDA staff must occur throughout the entire life cycle of the product in order to identify occurrences associated with the use of a drug or biologic in humans that could not have been predicted by such methods as clinical trials and bio-statistical analysis. These occurrences of adverse events or product problems must be reported to FDA in order for the Agency to carry out its mission protecting the U.S. public health.  CDER and CBER receive reports submitted by stakeholders such as manufacturers, importers, health care professionals, and consumers. In addition, FDA employees may obtain follow-up information and submit reports from the FDA field offices. 

For CDER and CBER the statutory provisions for FDAs requirement to record mandatory submission of adverse drug reports for an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) or New Drug Application (NDA), Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA,) Biologic Licensing Application (BLA)and OTC products in an adverse event reporting system is Section 505(k))(1)2 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 CFR 310.305, 312.32, 314.80 and 600.80, Public Health Service Act, and Public law 109-462 

Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), is a standardized international terminology for coding of medical information for regulatory communication. MedDRA was developed by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH); it is used in electronic transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) following the ICH E2B standards. MedDRA enables medical accuracy and transparency in coding, and standardized communication of coded data between manufacturers/sponsors and regulators.

The FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) develops and implements national programs to protect the public health in the fields of medical devices and radiological health. These programs are intended to assure the safety, effectiveness, and proper labeling of medical devices. CDRH has the responsibility for post-market surveillance such as monitoring the performance, safety, and effectiveness of marketed medical devices. The objective of post-market surveillance is to protect the public from actual or potential hazards associated with medical devices.  CDRH receives device event reports submitted by stakeholders such as medical device manufacturers, importers, user facilities, health care professionals and consumers.

Section 519 of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act authorized CDRH to record mandatory submission of reports to protect the public from actual or potential hazards associated with medical devices. The MDR Regulation (21 CFR Part 803) establishes the requirements for the mandatory reporting of adverse events involving medical devices. The Medical Device Amendments to the FD&C were enacted on May 28, 1976.  The FD&C Act was amended again in 1997 by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA), which provide for streamlining the process of bringing safe and effective medical devices to the U.S. Market.

Enactment of the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 (SMDA) and the 1992 Medical Device Amendment made a significant impact upon the mandatory aspects of CDRHs  post-market surveillance program.  In accordance with the MDR regulation 21 CFR Part 803.32 and 803.40, these revisions created an obligation for user facilities to report deaths and importers to report deaths and serious injuries directly to FDA and to the manufacturer.

The mission of the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) is to protect the public health by ensuring that the nations food supply is safe, sanitary, wholesome, and properly labeled, and that cosmetic products are safe and properly labeled.  CFSAN-regulated products include dairy products, plant foods, beverages, seafood, dietary supplements, cosmetic products, infant formula, medical foods, and color additives to food.  The CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) is a post marketing surveillance system to collect, analyze, monitor, and report adverse events and product complaints for CFSAN regulated products. Both mandatory and voluntary reporting of adverse events and product complaints are processed through CAERS.  In addition, specific legislation may require Centers to maintain stand-alone tracking systems such as infant formula and bioterrorism.  Mandatory reporting for dietary supplements is authorized under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FFD&C) Act Section 761 and mandatory reporting for reportable food is authorized under FFD&C Section 417.  

The Reportable Food Registry (RFR or the Registry) is an electronic portal for Industry to report when there is reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. The RFR applies to all FDA-regulated categories of food and feed, except dietary supplements and infant formula (Section 417 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350f)).  Registered Food Facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food for human or animal consumption in the United States under section 415(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 350d) are required to report to FDA when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.  Federal, state, and local Government officials may also use the RFR portal to report information that may come to them about reportable foods.  
The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) regulates the manufacture and distribution of food additives and drugs that will be given to animals. These include animals from which human foods are derived, as well as food additives and drugs for pet (or companion) animals. CVM is responsible for regulating drugs, devices, and food additives given to, or used on, over one hundred million companion animals, plus millions of poultry, cattle, swine, and minor animal species. 
Post-marketing surveillance affords the primary means by which CVM obtains information regarding potential problems with the safety and efficacy of marketed approved new animal drugs as well as potential product and manufacturing problems. CVM receives reports submitted by stakeholders such as: manufacturers, importers, health care professionals, and consumers. This contract, at the present time, will only address post-marketing safety reporting. The scope may broaden to include premarketing in the future.

Section 512(l) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(l), and  514.80(b) of FDA regulations (21 CFR 514.80) requires applicants of approved animal drugs  to report adverse drug experiences and product and manufacturing defects.  Product and manufacturing defects must be reported if they meet the criteria in 21 CFR 514.80(b)(1).  Adverse drug events and product and manufacturing defects involving animals must be submitted based on the criteria in 21 CFR 514.80 (b)(2)(i) and (ii), and (4)(iv).  Voluntary reports are also accepted from consumers and veterinarians.

The Tobacco Control Act enacted by Congress and signed by the President in June 2009 created the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP).  As the mission of this Center is developed, reporting regulations will be defined and may require collection of adverse event reports related to products that the Center regulates.  This Center will be eligible to have a task order under this Agency-wide contract.

Over time, FDA intends to replace multiple current legacy processes and data systems that are used for the receipt, processing, validation, and assessment of received reports.  These transitions may require the adoption of new software, revised SOPs, and additional staff training under this contract.  Additionally, FDA intends to adopt emerging data exchange standards which may impact future electronic submission procedures.  FDA is in the early stages of transitioning to a single electronic internet portal for adverse event and product problem reporting for all products.  This portal will be known as the Safety Reporting Portal.  The Safety Reporting Portal will allow reports to be typed into a "rational questionnaire" internet application that tailors questions based on the type of report, product, event, etc.  As FDA transitions to new technologies, it is expected that tasks under this contract will be impacted.  These impacts will need to be assessed as they occur and modifications to task orders under this contract may need to be considered. 

Objectives:

The objectives of the Data Management Program (DMP) are to obtain the services of a single Contractor to provide qualified support for: 
1.	Processing reports commonly known as Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) such as triaging, registering (logging), tracking, imaging or scanning, data entry, data entry quality control, updating of data records (to include resolving duplicates and conflicting information), reviewing, editing, coding, coding quality control (QC), coding quality assurance (QA), filing and redacting, distributing, archiving, and shredding of physical media.

<DESC>This acquisition is for a Firm Fixed-Price commercial contract to provide 24 x 7 operations and imagery management capability for the Defense Imagery Management Operations Center (DIMOC).  Operations and imagery management are the key components of the DIMOC mission. This capability encompasses still and video editing, caption editing, key wording of metadata for digital storage and retrieval of imagery, all combined with knowledge, skills and abilities to work in a complex military operational environment. This includes understanding of the duties and responsibilities of liaison officers (portfolio managers) working with combatant commands, DoD and the service components.

The Defense Imagery Management Operations Center (DIMOC) is the operational arm of the Defense Visual Information Directorate (DVI), a component of the Defense Media Activity (DMA). The DIMOC provides an enabling architecture to synchronize and integrate the various Department of Defense (DoD) imagery capabilities and centrally manages current and historical visual information to support worldwide DoD and other U.S. Government agency communication and operational missions with the right image in the right place at the right time. Headquartered in Alexandria, VA, the DIMOC operates from three geographically separated facilities in Riverside, CA, Tobyhanna, PA, and the Pentagon in Arlington, VA.  The three facilities work together to conduct the four primary functions of the DIMOC:  Visual Information (VI) Imagery Management and Distribution, VI Customer Service, VI Order Fulfillment, and VI Operations and Coordination.  Within the DIMOC Imagery Operations and Coordination (formerly known as the Joint Combat Camera Center (JCCC)) location, still and video imagery is received from DoD photographers and videographers operating from permanent and deployed locations around the globe. Once received, imagery is rapidly triaged, processed, and posted to the Defense Asset Management System (DAMS) where it is made available to registered users throughout the DoD and other U.S. Government agencies and to the general public through the website www.defenseimagery.mil.  Processing of imagery consists of photographically editing still and video imagery, copy editing imagery captions and other metadata as provided by the originator.

This procurement is Unrestricted. The applicable NAICS is 541611 with a size standard of $7.0 million. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price commercial contract with a base year period of 12 months, with four 1-year option periods.  The solicitation and all attachments will be electronically issued and may be accessed for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (EPS) site at www.fbo.gov.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is the responsibility of all interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments that may occur during the solicitation process. The solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 28 April 2010 with a closing date on or about 28 May 2010.  The Government will not provide paper copies of the solicitation package nor planholder list.  Fax, telephone, written or email requests for the solicitation package and planholder will not be honored. All questions concerning this RFP may be submitted by sending an email to the contracting point of contact not later than 10 calendar days prior to the RFP closing date.  Questions received less than 10 calendar days prior to the closing date of the RFP may not receive a response.  NOTE: The solicitation issuance date is an estimate, not an actual, and the actual can be before or after the stated date.  The response date cited above does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation costs. The Government reserves the right to cancel this procurement/ solicitation either before or after the RFP closing date, with no obligation to the offeror by the Government.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for contract award. For registration, go to www.ccr.gov and follow the instructions.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for the Guardian Angel Air-Deployable Rescue Vehicle (GAARV)
<p>1. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is soliciting information to identify possible sources to provide an air-droppable, surface recovery platform capable of maneuvering over adverse terrain in order to search for and recover isolated personnel (IP) and/or equipment, while also providing the capability of transporting the recovery team and the IP from an area of high threat to a defendable location for recovery by aircraft or self recovery to the final destination. The GAARV will be able to be deployed and recovered using airdrop, rapid on/off load, or sling load techniques by most existing and future fixed wing and heavy vertical lift rescue aircraft. The all-terrain capability inherent to the GAARV will also make this vehicle highly suited to hurricane response and other humanitarian relief operations by allowing teams to traverse streets flooded with up to 3 feet of water and piles of debris. The increased cargo capacity of the GAARV will provide the ability to transport medical and extrication equipment, in addition to extra supplies for survivors and the rescue team into the locations where it is needed most urgently.</p>
<p>This RFI supersedes and replaces RFI FA8629-10-R-XXXX originally posted on 9 October 2009.</p>
<p>Program Summary<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program will consist of COTS and developmental technology that can meet the requirements identified in this document.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please provide relevant information on training, logistics support and warranties.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or commit the government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated.<br />Respondents to this RFI should describe their ability to meet and/or exceed the (T) = Threshold (T) and Objective (O) requirements in:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attachment 1: GAARV SRD v1.9.1 dated 9 April 2010<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attachment 2: "Transportability of wheeled vehicle systems in the V<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -22" (SERAIR 435DM/5.5147 dated 9 April 2008)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FOC requires fielding of 58 GAARV's and establishment of training program and sustainment/ reconstitution systems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Material.

<DESC>The Satellite Control and Network Systems Group (SCNG) of the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) is exploring candidate approaches for a secure Compatible Satellite Command and Control (Compatible C2) Architecture by building a prototype lab implementation at The Aerospace Corporation in Chantilly, VA. The SMC/SCNG is developing a prototype based on NASA's Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (GMSEC) framework and standards implementation. This prototype will use selected legacy satellite C2 systems to demonstrate and test future framework implementation concepts, common satellite C2 services, space and ground situational awareness, common user display concepts, and approaches for Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense. To help SMC/SCNG determine the feasibility of acquiring a Compatible C2 architecture and framework that can meet these objectives, the Government requests information from industry on related company research activities that may support the Government's objectives. If interested in integrating a selected company's capability into the prototype lab, the Government requests additional information on how the company would assist the Government with demonstration licenses and complimentary technical support.

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

Specifications:  Only those sources with AP cartridge designs that fully conform to all the requirements of the Design Verification section of the performance specification(s) shall be considered for award. Interested sources without a previously verified design will be responsible to verify their cartridge design in accordance with the performance specification at their own expense. Upon completion of any design verification testing, the Government shall review the results and will determine if the design has met the requirements and if it was tested in compliance with the specification. Based on this evaluation, the government will determine if the design can be considered verified or not. Only those designs determined to be verified by the government will be eligible for award. In order to be eligible for award, all verification efforts shall be complete and results approved by the government prior to the close of any solicitation.

For this procurement the contractor will be responsible for assembling the rounds into the final DODIC/NALC configuration to include the M856 tracer, ready for issue to the user. Copies of the M995 and M993 performance specification are available upon request (contact information is given below).  
Planned Acquisition:  A five (5) year (FY11-FY15) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) systems contract is contemplated for this effort. The estimated quantity for both the M995 and M993 is 0-10M each per Fiscal Year.

7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Port-au-Prince, Haiti
8. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below 

I. STATEMENT OF DUTIES

I.  General Statement of the Purpose of this Contract and Responsibilities of the Contractor

Under the supervision of the U.S. Embassy Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) Director, the Counternarcotics Advisor will advise the Haitian National Police (HNP) on establishing effective counternarcotics (CN) operations, organizations, laws and procedures, including cooperative relationships with counterparts in the Dominican Republic and elsewhere in the region.  The incumbent will mentor and coach the BLTS counternarcotics unit of the HNP and assist with developing land and maritime border enforcement capabilities of the HNP.  The incumbent will maintain good working relationships with the Port-au-Prince Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office, the U.S. Coast Guard, other U.S. government and United Nations agencies involved in counternarcotics efforts in Haiti and the Caribbean.  As necessary, the incumbent will provide training to police officers, recruits, or other elements of the Haitian government.  The incumbent will provide briefings and other informational materials to NAS, U.S. Embassy staff, U.S. government officials and other interested parties as appropriate.   

Qualifications required:  Incumbent will have a strong background and substantial experience in counternarcotics programs or drug law enforcement at Federal, state or local level.  International experience strongly preferred.  French language proficiency is required at a minimum 2/2 level, or Creole at the 2/2 level. 

Background

The primary mission of INL is to develop policies and manage programs to combat international narcotics production and trafficking, combat international crime and terrorism, and strengthen capabilities of law enforcement and other legal institutions outside the United States.  INL does this through a comprehensive range of bilateral, regional, and global initiatives and assistance programs to set international counterdrug and anti-crime standards, foster cooperation among states, and build up the law enforcement capacity of foreign governments.  The programs enable foreign governments to act directly against traffickers and other crime groups and cooperate more effectively with U.S. law enforcement agencies. 
Strengthening Haitis law enforcement capacity is a key U.S. priority.  Improved security is critical to strengthening democracy, providing stability, establishing an environment for economic growth and investment, improving respect for human rights, and reducing drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and other transnational crime.  The INL program focuses on the development of an honest, professional and effective police and corrections force.  To stem the drug flow through Haiti, we have partnerships with Haitian authorities and are creating institutions to fight both drug trafficking and related money laundering.  In addition, the INL criminal justice program supports improvements to the infrastructure and management of the prison system.   

The HNP have little real capacity to investigate or respond to crimes, patrol, keep public order or even communicate internally.  These basic prerequisites for enforcing the law are lacking throughout Haiti, but particularly in Port au Prince slums which are the epicenter of anti-government and criminal activity.  Significant amounts of cocaine from South America transit the island of Hispaniola on its way to U.S. markets.  Cocaine arrives in Haiti by go-fast boats, other vessels and by small aircraft.  It is then shipped onward by sea in vessels or containers or by land through the Dominican Republic.  In addition to posing problems for the U.S., the drug trade in Haiti undermines the rule of law in that fragile country by fostering corruption and fomenting armed violence perpetrated by criminal gangs and political opposition groups.  

Stability in Haiti will contribute to its economic growth, enhancing security in the region and diminishing the attractiveness of illegal migration to the U.S.  To help achieve stability, the INL program also supports peacekeeping operations, including by providing U.S. police and corrections officers to the civilian police and corrections component of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the lead player in HNP and corrections reform and retraining.  
The Counternarcotics Advisor assists the NAS Director in the implementation of the program involving host government counterparts and other agency USG personnel. The NAS section is comprised of three USG direct hire employees, local FSNs, and U.S. personal services contract personnel. These positions include top level professionals engaged in political reporting and project management; technical administrative experts involved in engineering, construction, facilities management, accountants and contract specialists; and a variety of support personnel. 

The NAS is also responsible for implementation of the Haiti portion of the Merida Initiative -- a multi-year $1.4 Billion regional initiative to break the power of criminal organizations; strengthen border, air, and maritime controls from the Southwest border of the United States to Panama; improve the capacity of justice systems in the region to conduct investigations and prosecutions; consolidate the rule of law, protect human rights, and reform prison management; curtail criminal gang activity; and reduce the demand for drugs throughout the region.

Level of Effort

The position is full-time, with a minimum of 40 hours per week.

The Counternarcotics Advisor will report to the NAS Director or the NAS Deputy Director.

I. STATEMENT OF DUTIES

I.  General Statement of the Purpose of this Contract and Responsibilities of the Contractor

Under the supervision of the U.S. Embassy Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) Director, the Counternarcotics Advisor will advise the Haitian National Police (HNP) on establishing effective counternarcotics (CN) operations, organizations, laws and procedures, including cooperative relationships with counterparts in the Dominican Republic and elsewhere in the region.  The incumbent will mentor and coach the BLTS counternarcotics unit of the HNP and assist with developing land and maritime border enforcement capabilities of the HNP.  The incumbent will maintain good working relationships with the Port-au-Prince Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office, the U.S. Coast Guard, other U.S. government and United Nations agencies involved in counternarcotics efforts in Haiti and the Caribbean.  As necessary, the incumbent will provide training to police officers, recruits, or other elements of the Haitian government.  The incumbent will provide briefings and other informational materials to NAS, U.S. Embassy staff, U.S. government officials and other interested parties as appropriate.   

Qualifications required:  Incumbent will have a strong background and substantial experience in counternarcotics programs or drug law enforcement at Federal, state or local level.  International experience strongly preferred.  French language proficiency is required at a minimum 2/2 level, or Creole at the 2/2 level. 

Background

The primary mission of INL is to develop policies and manage programs to combat international narcotics production and trafficking, combat international crime and terrorism, and strengthen capabilities of law enforcement and other legal institutions outside the United States.  INL does this through a comprehensive range of bilateral, regional, and global initiatives and assistance programs to set international counterdrug and anti-crime standards, foster cooperation among states, and build up the law enforcement capacity of foreign governments.  The programs enable foreign governments to act directly against traffickers and other crime groups and cooperate more effectively with U.S. law enforcement agencies. 
Strengthening Haitis law enforcement capacity is a key U.S. priority.  Improved security is critical to strengthening democracy, providing stability, establishing an environment for economic growth and investment, improving respect for human rights, and reducing drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and other transnational crime.  The INL program focuses on the development of an honest, professional and effective police and corrections force.  To stem the drug flow through Haiti, we have partnerships with Haitian authorities and are creating institutions to fight both drug trafficking and related money laundering.  In addition, the INL criminal justice program supports improvements to the infrastructure and management of the prison system.   

The HNP have little real capacity to investigate or respond to crimes, patrol, keep public order or even communicate internally.  These basic prerequisites for enforcing the law are lacking throughout Haiti, but particularly in Port au Prince slums which are the epicenter of anti-government and criminal activity.  Significant amounts of cocaine from South America transit the island of Hispaniola on its way to U.S. markets.  Cocaine arrives in Haiti by go-fast boats, other vessels and by small aircraft.  It is then shipped onward by sea in vessels or containers or by land through the Dominican Republic.  In addition to posing problems for the U.S., the drug trade in Haiti undermines the rule of law in that fragile country by fostering corruption and fomenting armed violence perpetrated by criminal gangs and political opposition groups.  

Stability in Haiti will contribute to its economic growth, enhancing security in the region and diminishing the attractiveness of illegal migration to the U.S.  To help achieve stability, the INL program also supports peacekeeping operations, including by providing U.S. police and corrections officers to the civilian police and corrections component of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the lead player in HNP and corrections reform and retraining.  
The Counternarcotics Advisor assists the NAS Director in the implementation of the program involving host government counterparts and other agency USG personnel. The NAS section is comprised of three USG direct hire employees, local FSNs, and U.S. personal services contract personnel. These positions include top level professionals engaged in political reporting and project management; technical administrative experts involved in engineering, construction, facilities management, accountants and contract specialists; and a variety of support personnel. 

The NAS is also responsible for implementation of the Haiti portion of the Merida Initiative -- a multi-year $1.4 Billion regional initiative to break the power of criminal organizations; strengthen border, air, and maritime controls from the Southwest border of the United States to Panama; improve the capacity of justice systems in the region to conduct investigations and prosecutions; consolidate the rule of law, protect human rights, and reform prison management; curtail criminal gang activity; and reduce the demand for drugs throughout the region.

<DESC>1. Background:  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is responsible for developing an integrated Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack.  In October 2010, the Agency plans to begin the Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS) project as an eventual new space sensor layer for the BMDS.  The objective is to deliver an operational space-based system to address the ascent phase midcourse tracking challenge.  To meet this objective, the Agency plans first to develop a prototype system, followed by production of 9  12 spacecraft and associated ground control and processing equipment integrated with the developed Ballistic Missile Defense System elements enabling command and control, track generation, fusion, and transfer of data throughout the entire fire-control loop.  

2.  Description:

a.  Request for Information (RFI).  In an effort to conduct current market research, this is a Request for Information to gain insight from industry, the national laboratories, universities and university affiliated research and development centers on their capability to contribute to the PTSS development and deployment.  

b.  RFI Focus.   

Executive Summary
        MDA plans a full and open competition for production of the Precision Tracking Space System by industry in FY14. The manufacturing and production sustainment will include 9 to 12 space vehicles and ground segment software integrated into the BMDS. Prior to production, the Agency will conduct a prototyping effort starting in FY11 led by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The prototyping effort culminates in launch and on-orbit activities in FY15. Early in FY11 industry will be competitively awarded contracts, up to 5, to join the PTSS Integrated Systems Engineering Team to provide producibility influence and mass production considerations in the prototype design.

Details
        The Agency requests interested parties submit a capability statement demonstrating core capabilities, technologies, and expertise to collaboratively develop prototype system specifications, interfaces, components, and technologies that meet the objectives outlined below.  
        The PTSS will conduct prototype development with a national laboratory team, led by Johns Hopkins Universitys Applied Physics Laboratory.   PTSS will include participation of the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center and laboratory partners to include the Naval Research Laboratory, Utah State Universitys Space Dynamics Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Lincoln Laboratory, and Department of Energys Sandia National Laboratory. 
        During the prototype phase, industry will have the opportunity to compete for contracts to join the Integrated System Engineering Team (ISET).  Up to 5 contracts are planned for award in early FY11, prior to the prototype System Design Review.  As members of the ISET, industry will make recommendations on the prototype concept, design, analyses, trades, interfaces, and decisions.  Also, as part of the ISET, industry will be tasked to conduct specific engineering analyses to be developed and shared in a non-proprietary collaborative environment.  Finally, industry will be tasked to provide feedback and recommendations to the government on producibility and manufacturability issues as well as concerns for production of the constellation.
        The design approach is to make the space sensor layer a part of the integrated BMDS architecture assigning to PTSS the minimum necessary functionality. 
        Other competitive opportunities for industry may be available during the prototyping phase for components, subsystems and other critical technologies.   MDA contemplates establishing hardware catalogue items with industry partners.  These catalogue items will then be available for use during the production contract competition.
        MDA plans to competitively select one contractor for production after completion of prototype assembly, integration & test.  The production system performance will be tightly coupled to the prototype performance and maximum application of  lessons learned from the development and operation of the prototype and design traceability into the production constellation will be valued. The production contract is planned in two phases. The first phase includes engineering design efforts leading to a Delta Critical Design Review and long-lead item procurement.  The second phase is initial production, planned to start after successful launch, check-out, and on-orbit test of the prototypes. 
        This overall approach is designed to remove proprietary barriers, provide MDA access to the best technologies, open competition for production, and create a cost-effective and fiscally sustainable program.

c.  Place of performance.  Not applicable.
 
d.  Government-Furnished Information (GFI) / Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE).  GFI/GFE is not applicable.

e.  Responses:   MDA is requesting interested parties submit capability statements and white papers that capture core capabilities and expertise and demonstrate applicable technologies or concepts/approaches.

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>BACKGROUND Current and projected experiments using rodents to model the aging processes and age-related diseases in humans require animals of defined genotype and controlled environmental and health status. Only with the meticulous, long-term control of genetic and environmental variables is it possible to maintain relevant animal models that may be used to study many of the biological and behavioral processes in aging. Therefore, a continuous supply of genetically defined, well characterized inbred and hybrid laboratory animals is essential for a program of research on aging. In 2004, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) awarded a 9-year contract for the development and maintenance of a colony of aged F344 rats, and in 2005, NIA awarded a 9-year contract for the development and maintenance of a colony of aged Brown Norway (BN) and F344xBN F1 hybrid rats. The F344 contract was subsequently extended one year. The Statement of Work for those contracts, HHSN260200400008C and HHSN260200500006C, stated that another 9-year contract for continuation of each project would be awarded at the start of the seventh year of that contract. This RFP is for development of a new contract that will cover all three strains of rats, F344, BN, and F344xBN F1.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES The objective is to develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged, genetically defined laboratory rats for use by investigators in studies of aging. This colony is to be developed and maintained within controlled and defined barrier environments where animals are monitored and characterized for disease status and markers of genetic purity.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS This will be a nine (9) year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract under which the Contractor shall develop, maintain and distribute a standing colony of aged rats of NIA-specified genotypes for use by investigators in studies of aging. Although several different Task Orders will be issued, the expected duration of this colony is nine (9) years. Refer to the timeline attached to this notice. During years 1 through 2, animals shall be entered into the colony, but few animals shall be removed from the colony except for the purposes of monitoring health and genetic purity. However, if the need should arise, animals may be distributed from the colony at anytime at the direction of the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). During years 3 through 7, animals shall continue to be entered into the colony and animals shall be distributed to investigators. This should be a period of stable operation with young animals entering the colony at approximately the same rate as older animals leave the colony due to distribution and normal attrition. The final two year period, years 8 and 9, will serve as the colony close-out period. Animals shall be maintained and disbursed, but entry of animals shall cease at the beginning of year 8 or when entries begin in a renewal contract colony. Thus the population in this contract colony will decline over the last two year period to a point of near zero or very few animals at the end of year nine.<br />&emsp;<br />The colony population at the end of each year of the nine year period should be approximately as follows:</p>
<p>YEAR 1 5,000 YEAR 4 53,000 YEAR 7 53,000<br />YEAR 2 30,000 YEAR 5 53,000 YEAR 8 36,000<br />YEAR 3 50,000 YEAR 6 53,000 YEAR 9 Near 0</p>
<p>This animal colony shall be divided into two, approximately equal, separate segments. Each segment shall be maintained behind a totally independent barrier, specific pathogen- and parasite free, for the entire contract period. Both segments shall specifically be helicobacter-negative. The purpose of colony division is to insure the survival of at least one half of the colony in the event of pathologic breach of a barrier, mechanical failure of environmental maintenance systems, or accidental disaster such as fire, or flood. Total independence of colony segments therefore means separation of buildings, power systems and back-up systems, environmental controls (heat, air conditioning, and air filtration) and breeding stock. Each barrier shall have an independent back-up generator and alarm system in case of loss of power.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall acquire foundation stock for two inbred strains of rats from a stock center identified by the COTR and shall re-derive the stock by caesarian section or embryo transfer under barrier conditions. After re-derivation, testing to confirm genetic purity and SPF health status shall be performed on the foundation colony, and breeding colonies will be established for the two inbred strains and one derivative hybrid strain. Rats will be entered into the aging colony at levels defined in the contract Statement of Work (SOW), currently a total of 2,090 rats per month (the hybrid strain account for approximately 35% of the total entry levels).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide discrete production space for each colony segment within the barrier or isolation area for that segment. This space shall be defined within each unit, and the animals held therein until the scheduled removal or expiration of the animals. Facilities set aside for these colonies shall be provided with all equipment, materials, and supplies necessary to maintain these animals effectively within the barrier enclosure in a stable condition and environment. Since this is an aging colony, the Contractor must be prepared to house the animals for up to 2-3 years.</p>
<p>Rats shall be provided with sterilized laboratory animal feed, the formulation of which is consistent with NIH31 (Rader et al., 1986, J. Nutrition 116:1777-88) diet with regard to ingredients, both in kind and amount. The following items shall be controlled within the ranges specified: temperature (72-79oF), humidity (40-70%), light cycles (12/12 hours), air circulation (0.25m/hr/animal) and filtration (HEPA), and water chlorination and acidification (water shall be chlorinated and the pH controlled so as to not exceed pH 7.3 and 7-8 PPM chlorination at discharge end). A maximum of 25% re-circulated air within the barrier is allowed. Current ILAR (http://www.nap.edu/books/0309053773/html/index.html) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/references/phspol.htm) for breeding, care and maintenance of laboratory rats shall apply where specifications have not been detailed. Rats shall be monitored weekly for signs of fighting or morbidity.</p>
<p>Semi-annual genetic monitoring of the breeding colonies and quarterly health monitoring of the aging colonies shall be performed and reported to the COTR as well as be included in the semi-annual progress reports. Genetic monitoring shall be accomplished by a panel of microsatellite markers that distinguish the inbred strains. Health monitoring shall include external exams for parasites, microbiology, serology, and histology.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ship the rats to investigators upon authorization from the COTR, providing secure shipping crates, food and water sources, and climate-controlled transport. Shipment via dedicated, climate-controlled truck is the preferred method. The Contractor shall invoice customers for the cost of the animals (determined by the COTR) and all shipping costs, and apply the remittance to the cost of the contract. The Contractor shall account for all received funds on the monthly invoices. The Contractor shall weekly provide an inventory of the aging colony in a format approved by the COTR.</p>
<p>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES: (1) Post re-derivation Health and Genetic Monitoring Report - a report documenting the health status and genetic purity of the re-derived foundation stock within 120 calendar days after the birth of the re-derived litters.(2) Semi-Annual Progress Report - reports shall include any problems involving colony health, genetic monitoring, environment or environmental control. The report shall include the results of routine genetic monitoring and all laboratory tests executed either by Contractor as a routine part of the protocol or results from tests that have direct implication for colony health or development. All deaths or sacrifices from the colony shall be accounted for by strain, gender and age of the animal sacrificed or expired. (3) Weekly Inventory Report - a report which details the number, gender, strains and ages of animals in the colony. (4) Quarterly Health Monitoring Reports - reports shall contain descriptive clinical condition of the animals, gross pathologic observations of body tissues and organs, microbial, parasitological and serological evaluation, and histopathology of major organs and systems. (5) Genetic Monitoring Reports - reports shall include genetic quality control, including histocompatibility antigen and/or micro-satellite testing of a sample of breeder rats of each genotype to detect genetic contamination. (6) Individual Postmortem Reports - the report shall describe primary and secondary lesions possibly attributable to cause of death. (7) Final Report - it shall include a summation of the work performed under the entire contract period of performance</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. The anticipated period of performance is from 05/01/11 through 04/30/20.</p>

<p>Background</p>
<p>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors in the United States. The NRC implements regulations and develops and implements policies, programs, and procedures pertaining to all aspects of licensing and inspection of these facilities.</p>
<p>The NRC Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) is responsible for ensuring the public health and safety through licensing and inspection activities at all commercial nuclear power reactor facilities in the United States. Evaluation of license renewal applications (LRAs) is performed by the Division of License Renewal (DLR). DLR performs its work in accordance with the requirements of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 54 (10 CFR Part 54), "Requirements for Renewal of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Power Plants." In addition, DLR uses guidance provided in NUREG-1800, "Standard Review Plan for Review of License Renewal Applications for Nuclear Power Plants," Revision 1 (SRP-LR), dated September 2005, and NUREG-1801, "Generic Aging Lessons Learned (GALL) Report," Revision 1, also dated September 2005.</p>
<p>Capability Sought</p>
<p>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing technical assistance in evaluating LRAs submitted by applicants requesting renewal of their current power reactor licenses for a period of extended operation. In accordance with 10 CFR Part 54, the NRC evaluates the effects of aging on systems, structures, and components (SSCs) subject to an aging management review (AMR), to ensure that these SSCs continue to perform their required intended functions in accordance with the current licensing bases. Both the NRC's regulations and guidance documents are available on the NRC's public website at http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal.html .</p>
<p>Specific activities include providing technical assistance to the NRC that includes: 1) acceptance review of LRAs; 2) preparation of a safety evaluation report (SER); 3) participation in site audits; 4) support of Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) presentations; 5) support of technical issues that arise during license renewal review (such as buried piping, concrete degradation, boral, etc.); 6) preparation of technical reports; 7) review of licensee quality assurance plans and practices; 8) assistance in developing and implementing policies; 9) development of review processes and guidance documents; 10) support of pre-application activities; and 11) technical and expert witness hearing support for Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel (ASLBP) proceedings. NRR requires contractor support to augment the available staff resources and provide access to experts with competencies, accrued knowledge, and highly specialized skills in the areas of, but not limited to: nuclear engineering, materials engineering, corrosion engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and civil engineering. NRR requires qualified technical specialists with extensive expertise in the technical areas described.</p>
<p>The contractors should be technical experts in their field, with extensive research experience and active participation in cognizant standards-setting national code committees. The contractors should have in-depth knowledge in their technical area in order to identify and resolve issues. The contractors should also be technically creditable to respond to technical questions during ACRS presentations or ASLBP proceedings based on their in-depth knowledge resulting from their education, research experience, and code committee activities.</p>
<p>Commercial organizations that are interested in supporting our technical assistance requirements please address the market research questions below and provide capability information on your staff's qualifications and your firm's corporate experiences and qualifications on similar contracts or efforts. In addition, to provide an overview of your company's capabilities please complete the attached spreadsheet for those technical areas for which your firm has expertise. When completing the spreadsheets, please provide specific entries for potentially available qualified candidates. In each of the technical areas of expertise and education, if it applies, enter the candidates' relevant years of work experience, research experience, national code committee (IEEE, ASME, ASTM, etc...) experience, code committee names, and degree title.</p>
<p>Market Research Questions</p>
<p>1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number</p>
<p>2) How long has your company been in operation?</p>
<p>3) What type of business is your company (i.e., small, 8(a), service-disabled veteran-owned, etc.)?</p>
<p>4) How many people does your company employ, including consultants? Please break down the mix between the two categories.</p>
<p>5) Describe teaming arrangements your company has formed to perform scopes of work outside your core competencies. Describe both the type of work and how you managed it.</p>
<p>6) Has your company previously faced organizational conflict of interest issues with NRC? How were they resolved?</p>
<p>7) List any companies or government agencies your company either plans to or has performed work for related to civilian nuclear reactors. Describe the work performed.</p>
<p>8) Although no geographic restriction is anticipated, if responding organizations are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area, indicate how the organization would coordinate with the NRC program office located in Rockville, MD to provide support to multiple sites.</p>
<p>9) Describe any other information your company deems relevant to support NRC License Renewal activities.<br /><br />For questions No. 1 thru No. 9, please limit your response to no more than three pages total.</p>

<p>The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan. Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.</p>
<p>The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics. The U.S. Government's program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare. It ranks as one of the Agency's largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $115 million annually. The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 awards (acquisition and assistance). The staff manages a program that addresses six program areas principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.</p>
<p>The Mission currently has three technical offices: Office of Economic Growth (EG), Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM), and Health and Education (HE) and is in the process of developing its new whole-of government strategy for each country and the region for 2011-2016 that will create greater focus of our development efforts and require significant restructuring of our implementation portfolio.</p>

<p>National Science Board One of the important and vital roles of the Office is to maintain and serve as repository and unofficial archivist of documents and records of Board decisions, actions, policy statements and reports on national science and engineering policy issues. The NSB MOSS SharePoint site must be available to the Board no later May 3 to support the May 4-5, 2010 board meeting.</p>
<p>The current sites are live and in use by NSF and NSF partner agencies moving the current services to a new hosting provider is not an option (reference NSF five major requirements item number I), there can be no down time migrating from the current Dedicated Service to the new dedicated MOSS service. The current sites are active and used on a daily basis to move them to a new hosting provider wou1d cause a service outage for several weeks, and it would cause undue burden on the National Science Board, 6 NSF Directorates and NSF partner agencies.</p>
<p>In addition moving to a new service provider would change the URL (the web address to access the site) this would cause confusion with NSF users and disrupt operations.</p>
<p>Moving to a new provider NSF would have to re issues user accounts to over 200 users causing confusion and un due burden. User preferences, email subscriptions, and bookmarks would be lost.</p>
<p>Cost Factors: <br />a. Upgrading the current services is the most cost efficient method. If NSF migrated to another service provider NSF would lose its current investment and incur new cost to migrate and set up a new service.</p>
<p>b. Upgrading the current service will maintain the NSF web address which are http://extsharepoint.nsf.gov. Migrating to a new service provider would change the web address name. Changing the web site address would require NSF to incur additional cost to market and train NSBO Staff, NSF staff, NSF's advisory boards and NSF Partner <br />agencies.</p>
<p>c. SharePoint maintains version history, auditing and custom document management settings, which will be maintained if NSF upgrades its current service with the same provider. Migrating to a new provider will incur additional cost to maintain version and document histories and migrating to a new service provider will run the risk that some historical data may be lost.</p>
<p>d. Upgrading the current services will have minimal cost effect on NSF internal contract staff, migrating to a new service provider would incur additional cost for NSF by the additional work NSF contract staff will be required to do if NSF migrates to a new service.</p>
<p>Therefore, NSF intends to procure the upgrade services from Amp Technology, LLC on a sole source basis.</p>
<p>The period of performance is the date of award through 24 months. The proposed contract action is for services for which the government intends to sponsor with only one source under the authority of FAR 12.106. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. This synopsis is for information purposes only.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Public Law 111-5, the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO), intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with the University Corporation for Advanced Internet (Internet 2) to acquire backbone services for the NOAA Research Network (NRN).
<p>NOAA requires IP services, static and dynamic optical circuits, and collocation services from a backbone network provider. The optical circuits will be part of the interconnecting backbone between the supercomputing facilities. Circuit "links" and equipment collocation are required to complete an optical path interconnecting two specific sites and are required at various phases of the NRN build driven by the necessity of the geographic location and the needs of the associated NOAA research institution. IP services are required to integrate NOAA research sites not directly connected to backbone endpoints.</p>
<p>NOAA requirement for high-speed fiber optic connectivity to the Internet2 network for NOAA High Performance Computing resources in the United States satisfies all of the following:<br />&bull; Access to the lowest latency, highest capacity, highest quality data transfer throughput available for the lowest possible price;<br />&bull; Leverages NOAA's current investment in its optical network infrastructure, maximizing its return-on-investment (ROI);<br />&bull; Leverages NOAA's substantial research investment as a long standing member of multiple research consortiums;<br />&bull; Leverages NOAA's current and future network access privileges granted through consortium "Indefeasible Right of Use" agreements (IRUs);<br />&bull; Maintains NOAA's leadership role within the national, next-generation internet research community;<br />&bull; Honors NOAA's long standing commitments to its consortium partners and reduces adverse impacts on consortium members;<br />&bull; Leverages current unallocated capacity to communicate with multiple organizations within the optical network;<br />&bull; Provides high data integrity and data security<br />&bull; Opportunity and advantage to collaborate with federal agencies, labs, non-profit organizations, universities, libraries, and technology and information service providers throughout the United States.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract (base plus four option years) with the period of performance commencing approximately May 1, 2010. The NAICS code is 541519 - Other Computer Related Services.&nbsp; It is the Government's belief that only the University Corporation for Advanced Internet (Internet 2) can provide these required services. Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to furnish backbone services for the NOAA Research Network (NRN) capable of meeting the requirements identified in the attached Statement of Work. Seamless integration of the connectivity into NOAA Research Network is required. Vendors must include in its response, an explanation, in explicit detail, of its plan to implement and manage a seamless integration with the existing NOAA Research Network. Affirmative responses must be received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Responses shall be e-mailed to michael.blumenfeld@noaa.gov THIS NOT A SOLICITATION.</p>

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Dr. Lea of University of Tasmania. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice represents the only official notice. Proposed vendor shall perform the following tasks: 1. Analysis of telemetry data and associated capture data for 166 northern fur seal pups with satellite transmitters and the formation of a new database containing the state space modeling output combined with atmospheric covariates. The database should be compatible with existing databases for both raw and processed data within the Alaska Ecosystems Program and will be retained by NMML; 2. Assist in the writing and completion for publication of a manuscript detailing storm effects on the migratory patterns of pups and adults.; 3. Assist in the writing and completion for publication of a manuscript describing the derived predator related storm index; 4. The presentation of scientific results at least one major scientific conference, e.g. North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) or Society for Conservation Biology. The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) is conducting ongoing studies to investigate reasons for the decline of northern fur seals in Alaska. Northern fur seals are listed as "depleted" in U.S. waters under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. Biennial counts of pups on the Pribilof Islands indicate that the population decreased at approximately 5.8% per year between1998-2006, and the small recently established population on Bogoslof Island has increased at a rate of 12% per year from 1997 to 2005. The purpose of this project is to analyze the telemetry data obtained from fur seal pups during the winters of 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. The enormous amount of data that has been generated by this project requires an advanced researcher with the experience and knowledge of the data to be analyzed. Dr Lea is uniquely qualified to complete this work because of her ongoing work involving the fur seal telemetry data which has resulted in a database of all pup telemetry data, one published manuscript, a second in review by peer reviewed journal, and a third currently under internal review for manuscript submission. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with the period of performance commencing approximately May 1, 2010 thru April 30, 2011 with no option periods. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $7.0M. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due date set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>FY10 STATEMENT OF WORK<br />INVASIVE SPECIES CONTROL, GRAZING
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Decisions regarding weed control measures on F. E. Warren AFB are complicated by the presence of one threatened species within infested areas: Colorado butterfly plant (Gaura neomexicana coloradensis). This situation presents an opportunity to test potential methods for weed control in threatened species habitat for effectiveness, likelihood of adverse impact to sensitive species, and manageability.</p>
<p>TASKS</p>
<p>The contactor shall use goats to graze approximately 494 acres along portions of Crow Creek, Diamond Creek, and the unnamed drainage on F. E. Warren AFB (see attached map) to remove the majority of vegetative top growth of invasive species in these areas, which include Canada thistle, leafy spurge, Dalmatian toadflax, and small amounts of hound's tongue and hoary cress. The eastern parcel (comprising approximately 123 acres) shall be grazed twice - once at the beginning of the project and again at the end.</p>
<p>The contractor shall disperse seed prior to moving goats into an area. The base shall provide the seed to the contractor.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide transportation of the goats to and from the base.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide at least one (1) experienced livestock handler capable of understanding and speaking English.</p>
<p>No living facilities or services will be provided by the 90th Missile Wing. Contractor support will be handled on a case by case basis. If the livestock handler chooses to stay at the base campground, it is the responsibility of the contractor to pay all fees associated with staying at the campground. As of 3/17/10, a campsite with hookups is $20 per night and a dry campsite is $10 per night. These rates are subject to change.</p>
<p>Crow Creek is available as a water source for the goats. The contractor may provide portable water trough(s) for the animals, if desired. The base will supply water.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide portable fencing or other appropriate enclosures for the goats. All goats and other animals belonging to the contractor shall be under the control of the livestock handler at all times. If any of the contractor's animals wander off the base property, the contractor shall retrieve the animals immediately.</p>
<p>The contractor must remove goats from Colorado butterfly plant habitat (the five western-most parcels, comprising approximately 159 acres) no later than 15 June.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that goats and herding dogs do not disturb, attack, or injure the base pronghorn population or any other type of wildlife.</p>
<p>The contractor shall not accomplish predator control. Any predator control required by the contractor must be requested through the 90th Missile Wing Natural Resources Manager.</p>
<p>Traps or any type of weapon are not authorized on F. E. Warren AFB. The contractor shall not harm base wildlife.</p>
<p>The base is not responsible for any injuries and/or deaths of the contractor's livestock. Potential risks include lightning, rattle snakes, mountain lions, bobcats, and coyotes.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for disposing of livestock carcasses at the Cheyenne Landfill. The base is not responsible for disposing of carcasses belonging to the contractor.</p>
<p>The contractor shall contact the F. E. Warren AFB Game Warden or Law Enforcement Desk at least two (2) hours prior to moving goats across roads so that appropriate traffic control measures can be implemented.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance will begin 1 May 2009, plus or minus 15 days. Once started, the contractor has up to 120 days to complete the work.</p>

<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (10 AUG 2005)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 &lt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_rev2003.pdf&gt; competition performance decisions).<br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62224-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: Michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting <br />Officer.</p>
<p>5352.223-9001 HEALTH AND SAFETY ON GOVERNMENT INSTALLATIONS (JUN 1997)</p>
<p>(a) In performing work under this contract on a Government installation, the contractor shall:</p>
<p>(1) Comply with the specific health and safety requirements established by this contract;</p>
<p>(2) Comply with the health and safety rules of the Government installation that concern related activities not directly addressed in this contract;</p>
<p>(3) Take all reasonable steps and precautions to prevent accidents and preserve the health and safety of contractor and Government personnel performing or in any way coming in contact with the performance of this contract; and</p>
<p>(4) Take such additional immediate precautions as the contracting officer may reasonably require for health and safety purposes.</p>
<p>(c) The contracting officer may, by written order, direct Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Standards (AFOSH) and/or health/safety standards as may be required in the performance of this contract and any adjustments resulting from such direction will be in accordance with the Changes clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(d) Any violation of these health and safety rules and requirements, unless promptly corrected as directed by the contracting officer, shall be grounds for termination of this contract in accordance with the Default clause of this contract.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS (JUN 2002) (LOCAL)<br />AFFARS 5352.242-9000</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall obtain base identification and vehicle passes for all contractor/subcontractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Every person (contractor/subcontractor) must obtain a pass, long term or short term, (AF Form 75) to gain entry to base. Short- term passes (24 hours or less) may be obtained at the Main Gate Visitors Center. All passes for longer than 24 hours are issued at Pass and Registration, Building 100, Suite 1001. Duty hours are Monday- Friday 0730 - 1600 hours . Large vehicles (pickup trucks or larger) that carry tools, toolboxes, equipment, supplies, etc. shall use the Commercial Gate (South Gate) for base access. Passenger type vehicles including minivans and pickup trucks that do not carry tools, toolboxes, supplies, and equipment, etc. shall use the Main Gate for base access. All contractor/subcontractor employees shall exit via the Main Gate. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation. Contractors/subcontractors will not have access to base facilities other than work location, except for on-base eating facilities. Contract work hours will be as stated in the Statement of Work. Contractors/subcontractors will not have access to the base on nights and weekends unless the contract requires work to be done at those times. Any vehicle entering the base is subject to inspection at any time. Refusal may result in the individual being temporarily or permanently barred from the base.</p>
<p>(b) All contractors/subcontractors are subject to criminal background checks prior to being allowed on base to work. Contractors/subcontractors will not be issued passes prior to submitting to background checks and being cleared by Security Forces Squadron (approximately a two week period). Contractors/subcontractors may be barred from base at the Installation Commander's discretion based on unfavorable information resulting from background checks. The contractor shall submit a written request to the contracting officer electronically in Excel format using the sample listed in Section J. A statement that all personal information will be handled in the manner required by the Privacy Act of 1974 shall be included on the form. The request shall include the following information for each contractor/subcontractor employee:</p>
<p>Full name, date of birth, driver's license number including state of issuance, contract number/solicitation number, expiration date, and Contracting Office point of contact/telephone number. The contracting officer will endorse the request and forward it to the Security Forces Pass and Registration Office for processing. When reporting to the pass and registration office, the authorized contractor individual(s) shall provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, and valid vehicle insurance certificate to obtain a vehicle pass. Contractors/subcontractors will not be allowed to escort any contractor/subcontractor employees onto the base. Personnel that are not United States citizens or are foreign nationals may be required to provide additional identification documents with the request for base access. Special authorization may be necessary, prolonging approval/disapproval. The Government reserves the right to deny access to anyone.

<p><br />This infra-red gas exchange instrument will be used to measure carbon dioxide gas concentrations when either respired from animals, or taking up for photosynthesis for plants. The main purpose is to measure microbial respiration before and after disinfectant chemical treatments to determine the degree of microbial devitalization. APHIS/PPQ will also measure respiration levels from insect eggs, insects and snails before and after chemical control to estimate respired carbon dioxide levels. The difference between respiration levels allows them to estimate percent kill from a treated sample. This device will also be used to measure plant photosynthesis for herbicide trials and basic invasive plant biology measurements.</p>
<p>ITEMS NEEDED:</p>
<p>1EA - Portable photosynthesis system</p>
<p>&bull; Need a infra-red gas exchange instrument that is an open system and will quantify carbon dioxide concentrations with a high degree of sensitivity.<br />CO2 sensor should be located in the sensor head.</p>
<p>&bull; Quantify carbon dioxide concentrations due to aerobic respiration from organisms ranging from microbes to insects to snails.</p>
<p>&bull; Carbon dioxide range - 0 to 3000 umol/mol<br />Accuracy - max deviation 5 umol/mol from 0 to 1500 umol/mol</p>
<p>&bull; It must be portable. Instrument should have exchangeable chambers to measure different organisms from microbes to animals to plants. Instrument must have environmental controls and be programmable from the console.</p>
<p>1EA - Insect respiration chamber kit<br />&bull; A gas exchange plastic tube chamber to measure insect respiration rates based on mass of insect.</p>
<p>&bull; Quantify carbon dioxide concentrations being respired by insects over time.</p>

<p><br />1EA - Whole plant Arabidopsis chamber</p>
<p>&bull; A gas exchange chamber to measure carbon dioxide uptake for photosynthesis of an whole plant (Arabidopsis), or measure respiration of small animals.</p>
<p>&bull; Quantify carbon dioxide being taken up by a whole plant placed inside the chamber, or quantify respiration rates for small animals placed inside the chamber.</p>
<p>&bull; Must be a multi-functional chamber. It is able measure respiration of small animals such as snails, or insects, and it must also measure photosynthesis of a small plant placed inside the chamber. The chamber must be exchangeable with other respiration chambers on infra-red gas exchange instrument. Chamber must be large enough to contain a small plant or about 2.5" in diameter to hold a potted plant inside the chamber.</p>
<p><br />1EA - Fluorescence chamber</p>
<p>&bull; A infra-red chamber used to measure photosynthesis and/or leaf fluorescence of green plants.<br /><br />&bull; Chamber has dual functions for gas exchange (photosynthesis) and as a light source/fluorometer, which can collect both fluorescence and photosynthesis simultaneously. Chamber can measure instantaneous carbon uptake, transpiration, and leaf stress levels.</p>
<p>&bull; Chamber head must be exchangeable with other chambers for the infra-red gas exchange instrument. Chamber must be capable of measuring photosynthesis and leaf fluorescence.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed priced, sole-source purchase order will be issued for the proper sampling, packaging, transporting, and analysis of hazardous material samples at former Camp Sibert, Gadsden, Alabama.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Hendrix Enterprises, Madison, AL) under the authority of FAR 13.106 under FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The Government has determined that competition of these highly specialized services would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  <BR><BR>The Contractor shall provide the services in accordance with (IAW) the terms and conditions contained herein:<BR><BR>Statement of Work<BR><BR>1.0 Site Location.  The Project Manager of Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel will be conducting an Explosive Destruction System (EDS) destruction operation at the Former Camp Sibert in Gadsden, Alabama.<BR><BR>2.0 EDS Destruction Operation Schedule.  The EDS destruction operation schedule is currently estimated at:<BR><BR>Mobilize Equipment and Resources to site			10 June 2010<BR>Site Set-up							14 -22 June<BR>Pre-Op & Findings Resolution				23 - 29 June<BR>Destruction Operations					30 June  13 July<BR>Site Closure							14 - 30 July 2010<BR>Demobilize							30 July 2010<BR><BR>Actual operational dates will be confirmed as the mobilization date approaches.<BR><BR>3.0 The contractor shall, as an independent contractor, and not as an agent of the Government, provide the necessary equipment and properly trained resources to accomplish the specific project objectives defined in this statement of work (SOW).<BR><BR>3.1 Industrial hygiene (IH) monitoring.<BR><BR>3.1.1 Industrial Hygiene monitoring shall be conducted by the contractor during CNB and CNS operations to evaluate employee exposure, establish historical data, assist in the design or evaluation of control measures, and to document compliance with government regulations.  A Certified Industrial Hygienist (CIH) provided by the contractor shall oversee the sampling locations, equipment selection, review results, and prepare reports (including chain of custody documents).  The sampling approach shall be completed in accordance with the NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods (NMAM) or methods listed in the OSHA Salt Lake Technical Center (SLTC) Chemical Sampling Information (CSI).<BR><BR>IH monitoring will not be performed during FS smoke or water-fill operations.  <BR><BR>Area monitoring and personal sampling shall be conducted by the contractor during EDS operations.  Personal sampling shall include the monitoring of EDS operators breathing zones during operations.  Since there will be three operators within the EDS, each operator will wear a sampling pump for a different chemical as specified in accordance with paragraph 3.1.2 for CNS-filled munitions and section 3.1.3 for CNB-filled munitions.  Sampling levels shall be assessed in line with the Exposure Levels identified in Table H-3-1 of the Sibert operational Safety Health and Emergency Response Plan (SHERP) and other published exposure limits.  Sampling shall be in the form of time weighted averages (TWAs) and short term exposure limits (STELs).  TWAs shall be measured for the entire work shift, while the STELs are likely to be measured during situations determined by the CIH to result in a higher exposure level.  Baseline levels shall be measured during the pre-operational survey. <BR><BR>Some methods require that personal sampling equipment (for example, portable, battery-operated pumps) be calibrated by the contractor before and after each days use.  The calibration information shall be recorded for each sample conducted.  <BR><BR>Monitoring documentation shall include the following at a minimum: <BR>3.1.1.1 Field sample number<BR>3.1.1.2 Date sampled<BR>3.1.1.3 Name of person (first and last name) and organization conducting sample<BR>3.1.1.4 Name of person, job category, and organization who is wearing sample media<BR>3.1.1.5 Location<BR>3.1.1.6 Chemical to be analyzed<BR>3.1.1.7 Possible interferences<BR>3.1.1.8 Work activity<BR>3.1.1.9 Work period<BR>3.1.1.10 Control measures (for example, PPE, ventilation)<BR>3.1.1.11 Pre-work calibration day, time, and results<BR>3.1.1.12 Post-work calibration day, time, and results<BR>3.1.1.13 Calibration method<BR>3.1.1.14 Sample type (for example, personal, area)<BR>3.1.1.15 Sampling method<BR>3.1.1.16 Instrument type and serial number<BR>3.1.1.17 Sampling media<BR>3.1.1.18 Flow rate<BR>3.1.1.19 Sampling time<BR>3.1.1.20 Weather conditions (temperature, barometric pressure, relative humidity, wind speed and direction)<BR><BR>3.1.2 Personal Sampling for CNS-Filled Munitions.  The following chemicals shall be monitored by the contractor during CNS operations:  CN, PS, and CHCl3.  CN can be measured using one of two sampling approaches.  CN can be measured using the Physical and Chemical Analytical Method (P&CAM) 291 (II-5), which is included in the NMAM 2nd edition, volume 5.  This method incorporates standard equipment (that is, gas chromatograph [GC]) that can be utilized in mobile laboratories.  For CN sampling, OSHA lists a CSI partially validated method; however, it involves analytical equipment (that is, high performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]) that would normally not be associated with a mobile laboratory.  There is no NIOSH measurement method for PS; however, the OSHA CSI lists a partially validated method.  CHCl3 can be measured using one of two sampling approaches.  CHCl3 can be measured by either following the hydrocarbons, halogenated method explained in NMAM Method number 1003 or the fully validated OSHA Manual of Analytical Methods (Method Number 05).<BR><BR>3.1.3 Personal Sampling for CNB-Filled Munitions.  The following chemicals shall be monitored by the contractor during CNB operations:  CN, benzene, and CCl4.  CN can be measured using one of two sampling approaches.  CN can be measured using the P&CAM 291 (II 5) method.  OSHA lists a CSI partially validated method; however, it involves analytical equipment (that is, HPLC) that would normally not be associated with a mobile laboratory.  Benzene can be measured by following several different NMAM methods or the fully validated OSHA Manual of Analytical Methods (Method Number 1005).  CCl4 can be measured using one of two sampling approaches.  CCl4 can be measured by either following the hydrocarbons, halogenated method explained in NMAM Method number 1003, which was partially validated by OSHA, or the OSHA Manual of Analytical Methods (Method Number 07).<BR><BR>3.2 Sampling of Hazardous Waste.  After the waste has been transported to the less than 90-day waste storage, the contractor shall obtain a representative sample from all liquid hazardous waste containers from the Explosive Destruction System (EDS) operations at Camp Sibert.  These samples shall be obtained, containerized, packaged, and transported in accordance with all applicable DOT regulations.<BR><BR>3.2.1 The hazardous waste generated by the EDS destruction operation is estimated to be:<BR><BR>3.2.1.1 (12) 55-gallon of solid waste drums containing metal scrap from the EDS chamber<BR><BR>3.2.1.2 (15) 55-gallon liquid waste drums containing CNB, propylene glycol and water; CNS, propylene glycol and water; and FS smoke and sodium hydroxide and water; and other normal liquids from an EDS operation<BR><BR>3.2.1.3 (12) 55-gallon solid waste drums containing PPE, etc. and other normal solids from an EDS operation<BR><BR>3.3 Lab Analysis.  The contractor shall obtain the services of an Alabama certified laboratory meeting with the approval of the state of Alabama for the proper RCRA characterization analysis of all liquid waste samples collected from wastes generated during the EDS destruction operation.  The contractor shall transport the waste samples to the certified laboratory for RCRA analysis.  The Contractor shall review the analytical results and make the proper determinations to characterize the EDS wastes to ensure proper management related to labeling, placarding, and all necessary waste shipping/transportation documentation.<BR><BR>3.4 Waste Documentation.  <BR><BR>3.4.1 Waste Profile.  The contractor shall prepare a waste profile for each container/type of waste generated from the EDS destruction operation.  The contractor shall obtain the approving signature of XXXX, from the Corps of Engineers, for all waste profiles.  XXXXs phone number is XXXX.  The contractor shall provide copies of the signed waste profiles to XXXX, of XXXX for use in preparing hazardous waste manifests for the generated waste.  XXXXs address is:<BR><BR>XXXX<BR>XXXX<BR>XXXX<BR><BR>XXXXs office phone is XXXX and cell phone is XXXX.  <BR><BR>3.4.2 Hazardous Waste Manifest.  The contractor shall obtain all hazardous waste manifests related to the wastes generated from the EDS destruction operation from XXXX and obtain an approval signature from XXXX.<BR><BR>3.4.3 Final Documentation.  No later than 2-weeks after completing the EDS destruction operation the contractor shall provide electronic copies of laboratory analytical results, including chain of custody, all signed waste profiles, and signed waste manifests to:<BR><BR>3.4.3.1 XXXX, and,<BR><BR>3.4.3.2 XXXX<BR><BR>3.5 Waste Container Labeling.  In accordance with applicable RCRA regulations, the contractor shall obtain and apply the proper labeling to each container of hazardous waste prior to shipping.  <BR><BR>3.6 Inspection of Temporary Storage Area.  On a weekly basis, the contractor shall conduct inspections of the less than 90 day waste storage area in which the EDS process wastes were placed.  During this inspection, the contractor shall observe the condition of the waste containers and examine these containers for signs of leaking or deterioration of the containers from corrosion or other factors.  In the event that leaking or deterioration is observed, the contractor shall immediately contact the following persons via phone and email, and provide a detailed report of the issue:<BR><BR>3.6.1 XXXX	Cell Phone: XXXX<BR>	Email:  XXXX<BR><BR>3.6.2 XXXX	Phone:  XXXX<BR>	Email:  XXXX<BR><BR>3.6.3   XXXX	Phone:  XXXX<BR>	Email:  XXXX<BR><BR>3.7 Shipment of Waste.  The contractor shall communicate with XXXX, XXXX, to determine the actual date of waste pickup.  The contractor shall have a representative present, at the pickup site, at the time the waste is loaded on to the transport vehicle.  The contractor shall ensure that all waste generated by the EDS destruction operation is loaded on the transport vehicle and that all paperwork is in order and complete.<BR><BR>3.8 Inspection/Acceptance.  Inspections shall be in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of this purchase order.  Final acceptance by the governments authorized representative of the services will be determined in accordance with the requirements of this purchase order and will be provided in writing to the contractor.<BR><BR>3.9 Period of Performance.  The overall duration of this task is 120 days after purchase order award.  All efforts under this purchase order shall be completed no later than 120 days after purchase order award.  The contractors responsibilities shall begin as the first hazardous waste container is placed in the less than 90 day waste storage area, and shall end as the last waste container is placed on the truck for transporting to a Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facility (TSDF).  The anticipated period of performance for this purchase order is estimated to be 10 June 2010 through 30 July 2010.

GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR.   

BACKGROUND 
This position is located in the Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) at the U.S. Embassy in Lima, Peru. The incumbent, working with the Senior Police Advisor, works on law enforcement matters for NAS in support of police institutional development activities, among them in the counternarcotics area, in Peru.  The field advisor spends much of his time in the field (i.e., at police bases throughout Peru) and is responsible for program management services to design, plan, implement, monitor, and evaluate the police program, assistance, training, and operations. The incumbent advises the Peruvian National Police (PNP) and works to help build and professionalize the institution. 

Specific program management responsibilities include: 

1.	Serve as a NAS project advisor in the implementation of a program to develop the institutional capacity of the Peruvian National Police (PNP), primarily the Counter-Drug Directorate (DIRANDRO), to decrease and discourage drug production and trafficking in Peru and to maintain a professional corps of law enforcement professionals.

2.	Assist NAS Director, Deputy Director, and Senior Police Advisor in analyzing and evaluating the planning, design and implementation of programs.  Keep the Director, Deputy Director, and Senior Police Advisor informed regarding the performance of DIRANDRO and other PNP elements involved in counter-narcotics activities.  

3.	Advise DIRANDRO Director and other senior officers, providing guidance on counter-narcotics program development, planning, and evaluation.

4.	Work with PNP training officers and appropriate outside consultants, to devise and support an overall training program for DIRANDRO and other PNP personnel based upon a determination of appropriate skill sets needed for effective police work, especially in the counternarcotics field.  

5.	Coordinate closely with DEA and DIRANDRO special investigative and intelligence collection units to assist the PNP in improving, developing, and monitoring the effectiveness of counternarcotics operations.

6.	Prepare comprehensive periodic reports, analysis, and cables of major law enforcement issues in Peru, such as changes in drug trafficking patterns, significant developments in institutional capacity of the police, or policy recommendations. 

7.	Evaluate requests from the PNP for operational, logistical, or institutional support and recommend course of action to NAS Director and Deputy Director.  Prepare draft correspondence for appropriate reply.  

8.	Working in conjunction with the NAS Procurement Office and NAS Administrative Officer, define annual commodity procurement requirements and provide estimated consumption forecasts for project-supported National Police activities, including institution building and tactical operations.  Monitor the use of U.S. Government (USG)-provided assistance in the field. 

9.	Prepare and present briefings to USG, Government of Peru (GOP), and third country government officials concerning counter-narcotics programs in Peru.

10.	Working in conjunction with the NAS Accounting Office and NAS administrative Officer, devise annual budgets for the law enforcement project that will facilitate achievement of project goals and objectives.

1.	SUPERVISION
The Contractor receives general policy advice, supervision, and guidance from the NAS Director, NAS Deputy Director, and Senior Police Advisor.  Incumbent reports to the Senior Police Advisor, and in his absence to the NAS Deputy Director.  Assignments are given to meet broad, general objectives.  Incumbent must use good judgment, creativity, and independence in planning work to achieve specific goals and objectives. Incumbent informs supervisor of problem areas and presents recommended solutions. Analysis, evaluations, and recommendations developed by the advisor are reviewed by superiors for potential influence on broad policy objectives and program goals.  

2.	SUPERVISION EXERCISED
The Contractor indirectly supervises a Program Assistant. 

3.	GUIDELINES
Guidance is provided by Department of State and Administration policy and directives and operating procedures regarding U.S. international narcotics control matters.

4.	COMPLEXITY
Assignments involve organizations, operations, and functions of significant complexity with inter-related USG and GOP programs in an international environment.  Adaptability and flexibility are indispensible. Incumbent may occasionally initiate new or substantially modified methods and procedures, which result in significant program changes. 

5.	EXERCISE OF JUDGMENT
Sound judgment is required to assist in negotiating agreements and recommending major expenditure of funds for assistance. 

6.	SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS
Assignments and objectives will require analysis and investigation to prevent, detect and resolve problems.

7.	NATURE, LEVEL, AND PURPOSE OF CONTACTS
Contractor is expected to maintain close working relationships with all levels of the PNP and other GOP entities, within the Ministry of the Interior and with USG personnel of various agencies.  The incumbent mentors senior police officers, and advises them on ways to strengthen their institution. Contractor has frequent contact with PNP officers, with officials of the GOP counter-narcotics control board (DEVIDA) and with drug prosecutors and officials of the GOP's Public Ministry.

(iii) This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39.
(iv) This solicitation is a 100% small business set-aside. NAICS Code is 333314; Small business size standard is 500.
(v) This combined synopsis/solicitation is for the following commercial items: 
0001: Epi-fluorescence inverted microscope. Qty 1 each.
(vi) Description of requirements for the services to be acquired: This requirement is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Microscope must meet the following minimum specifications: Must be manufactured under strict quality control requirements outlined in the ISO 9001 standards. Must accept 100 VAC power (normal wall outlet plug). Must be warranted a minimum of 5 years for any problems arising from normal usage. The defective microscope and/or parts must be replaced as needed at no cost during the warranty period. The microscope must be a professional grade inverted epi-fluorescence trinocular microscope capable of viewing ethidium dibromide DNA dyes under fluorescence and cytology-like translucent samples under phase contrast or bright field (i.e. veligers).  The inverted design shall allow for viewing from the bottom of the slide or dish. Must be capable of performing fluorescence via incident light excitation, phase contrast for translucent low-contrast specimens (i.e. veligers), and bright field via transmitted light. Must fit easily on a regular laboratory benchtop with normal power and room temperature requirements. Must be capable of providing bright and clear images through high quality optics.  The required bright field and phase contrast optics are 10x (0.25 NA with 8.1 mm working distance), 25x (0.40 NA with 4.8 mm working distance), and 40x (0.60 NA with 3.3 mm working distance).  The required phase contrast and fluorescence magnifications are 100x, 250x, and 400x. These objectives must be designed for a typical cover glass thickness of 1.2 mm (i.e. bottom of petri dish or slide). The microscope must come equipped with fine and coarse focusing knobs on both sides of the microscope. The fine focusing knobs must be adjustable down to 0.002 mm. The movement of the optics must be locked at the extreme end of the range to prevent contact with the specimens on the stage. For illumination, the fluorescence excitation light source must be a super high pressure mercury lamp, complete with an external power source (100 W DC) that can be easily centered for the best viewing angle.  The microscope must have optical filters that allow selection of excitation wavelengths in the UV (330 nm to 400 nm), violet (395 nm to 415 nm), blue (420 nm to 485 nm), and green (460 nm to 550 nm).  In the same wavelength regions, the microscope must also be equipped with the corresponding cutoff emission filters at 425 nm (UV), 455 nm (violet), 515 nm (blue), and 590 nm (green).  For the bright field illumination, the light source must be a variable intensity and focusable halogen lamp position above the stage for transmitted light viewing.  The microscope must come with extra mercury and halogen bulbs. The head of the microscope should be inclined at a 30 degrees angle for viewing comfort. It must be equipped with a trinocular head to allow for easy switching of multiple optics. The distance between the eyepieces must be adjustable to allow a wide range of interpupillary distances. It must also come equipped with diopter adjustment to correct for individual vision needs. The stage must be an X-Y mechanically movable stage with an area of at least 225 mm x 255 mm.  Must include specimen holder plates for various applications (slides, petri dish, gels, etc.). The microscope must be fully integrated with color digital camera that can be connected to a computer via a USB port and a CCD video camera for analog output to a T.V.  The microscope system must include the digital and video cameras that allows images to be captured permanently. The digital camera must be capable of taking still color photographs with 640 x 480 pixel resolution. The digital camera must come with a reduction lens system to allow for de-magnification of images if necessary. The digital camera must come with a USB connection and cable to allow connection to a computer for downloading of photographs to the computer (Windows capture and editing software must be included if necessary). The video camera must be a CCD color video camera with analog output for connection to a CCTV monitor or regular T.V.  This is use for full motion viewing and recording. The video camera must have at least 420 horizontal lines resolution with low light requirement.  Must come with its own power supply and video cable with RCA jacks.  Required accessories for mounting the cameras onto the microscope must be included. The microscope system must come with a carrying case for safe transport of the microscope.

STATEMENT OF WORK:Seabird Interoperability SystemObjectives SummaryThis project seeks to develop an interoperability framework between distributed sources of worldwide seabird colony distribution and abundance data.   Data interoperability will be achieved through adherence to Open Geospatial Standards (OGC) and the utilization of Web Maps Services (WMS), Web Feature Services (WFS) and Web Coverage Services (WCS).  These interoperability standards will be implemented through the use of open source web mapping system.  Data sources will be assessed and data interoperability nodes will be set up for those data sources which have the IT capacity to support a live web mapping system.  Colony locations will also be acquired and loaded into the world seabird colony database.  
BackgroundInteroperability allows agencies to retain local control of data, while allowing outside computer systems to access data through standardized protocols. Data access based upon interoperability enables applications to draw upon and utilize information that can exist at multiple physical locations and are stored in a wide array of data formats. Interoperability data networks balance work load across multiple computing systems, exploit bandwidth, and provide a framework for cost sharing between organizations. 
The following agencies and countries have seabird colony data that are potential data sources for Pan Arctic region. Contacts to each agency will be provided when the contract is awarded.  "	Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Great Britain "	Greenland Institute of Natural Resources"	Icelandic Institute of Natural History "	Norwegian Polar Institute for Nature Research "	Environment Canada "	Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, Russia  

Tasks1.	Acquire data sources for review (May) - Acquire copies of international seabird databases and datasets from agencies listed in the background section and assess. Databases and datasests are in Microsoft Excel or Access.  Engage data providers to acquire contextual understanding and to assess capacity to host an interoperability service.2.	Absorb colony data for all data sources into colony database (May-June) - Extract colony GIS data from international databases and datasets and load into world seabird colony database.3.	Develop methods and implementation protocol for distribution to agencies (June)-   Write and distribute technical protocol for agencies involved in data interoperability. This task involves formalizing the methods employed during this project. The resulting document will provide agencies and organizations with a best practices or set of instructions for organizing their seabird data resources and making those data available for public access via interoperability in a cost effective manner. This document will be created in Microsoft Word and should have diagrams where needed to help explain methods.4.	Implement Interoperability System Deployment (May-September) - Design a pilot distributed data management framework for the storage and dissemination of seabird colony distribution and abundance data. This task will be accomplished using the disparate data sources and types identified in the Background section. The interoperability system will involve the installation of a web mapping/interoperability system within agencies participating in this project.5.	Connect Interoperability nodes to World Seabird Information System (May-September) - Provide access to data made available through the implementation of interoperability nodes through a web-based data portal.  Data will be pulled from multiple sources and assimilated onto a web based map.
Schedule
1.	Acquire data sources for review (May 15, 2010) 2.	Absorb colony data for all data sources into colony database (June 30, 2010)3.	Develop methods and implementation guide for distribution to partner agencies (June30, 2010)4.	Implement Interoperability System Deployment (May 1, 2010-September 30, 2010)5.	Connect Interoperability nodes to World Seabird Information System (May 1, 2010-September 30, 2010)

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additionalinformation included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for Task 1: RequirementsAssessment, Task 2: Trade Study, Task 3: Conceptual Design, and Task 4: Reports, inaccordance with the following specifications for a system for providing cooling for Venusexploration:BACKGROUND:In the coming years, NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) intends to build a room-sized testcell that simulates the physical conditions on the surface of Venus.   Venus is theclosest planet to Earth, but it has an extremely hostile environment.  Its surfacetemperature is 500 degrees Centigrade;	its surface air pressure is about 95 times thatof earths;  the planet revolves so slowly that just one of its days is equal in lengthto 243 earth-days; and the atmosphere on the surface of Venus includes sulfuric acid asone of its components.	NASA has explored Venus in the past, but those missions have beenvery limited because of the environmental constraints; instruments actually melt withinhours of exposure to the planets atmosphere and heat.	Consequently, our first-handknowledge of Venus is limited to a very short sampling-timeframe, roughly equivalent towhat we could learn in a two-minute sampling window on earth.  NASAs goal is to be ableto sample a full sunup-to-sunup Venus day (or, 243 earth-days), in order to betterunderstand its unique environment.  Building this world-class, unique test cell is aprelude to robotic exploration of our nearest planetary neighbor, and it is expected toattract/service researchers from all over the world.  NASA GRC intends to develop a combined Stirling power and cooling system (Stirlingduplex) to enable long-lived Venus surface missions.  The cooling system will need to beable to provide multistage cooling using a pneumatic oscillating pressure wave drivingsource.  Since this cooling system will be integrated within multiple concentric pressurevessel spheres and launched from Earth, it is paramount to maximize its efficiency whileminimizing its volume and mass.  In the Purchase Order that results from thissolicitation, a trade study and conceptual design for such a cooler will be delivered toNASA GRC.  The first stage will lift 400 Watts of heat from an inner coldbay sphere at 30degree Centigrade, and the second stage will lift at least 1100 Watts of heat from theouter coldbay at 250 degree Centigrade, and all this heat is to be rejected to the Venussurface at 500 degree Centigrade.NASA GRC anticipates a 9 month period of performance.The system to be studied is a cooler, which is part of a Stirling duplex machine, andutilizes energy from a heat source (exhausted to Venus ambient temperature) to both drivea Stirling-cycle cooler and a Stirling-cycle power converter.  The Contractor shallprovide the initial development of a cooler conceptual design suitable for Venusoperations.  TASK 1:  REQUIREMENTS ASSESSMENTA.  The Contractor shall define the system requirements (mass, lifetime, vibrationlimitations, environmental considerations such as Venus atmospheric pressure andcomposition, etc.) for the cooler.B.  The Contractor shall define the trade space including operational temperatures;acceptable heat shielding; cooler staging configurations; heat engine working fluid,frequency, gas pressure, and gas amplitude; and acceptable PV power draw from the heatengine to drive the Venus Lander Cooling System (VLCS).  The trade space is defined asthe range of cooler design parameters in which the system performance meets the standardsshown in Task 2.TASK 2: TRADE STUDYA.  The Contractor shall generate a simplified thermal model of the Venus Lander. TheContractor shall calculate heat shield heat rates as a function of the shieldtemperatures.B.  The Contractor shall calculate the PV power draw, gas flow, and gas phase relative topressure phase, over the trade space defined in Task 1 (i.e., across the defined range ofoperating frequency, gas pressure, and gas pressure amplitude)C.  The Contractor shall address a minimum of 3 different staging configurations, inorder to optimize the system performance (minimize heat engine heat input) byintercepting the environmental heat at temperatures in between the 500C environment andthe 30C electronics.D.  The Contractor shall assess the expected performance of a cooling system driven by anacoustic Stirling heat engine and a free piston Stirling engine.  This assessmentincludes identifying the system mass and volume; the system efficiency and heat lifted;and, the anticipated development risk and cost for each option studied.TASK 3:  CONCEPTUAL DESIGNA.  The Contractor shall provide an electronic copy of conceptual design drawings (asdefined below) for an optimized multistage cooler optimized for a proposed Venus FlagshipMission Lander.Conceptual Design Drawing:  The intended use for a Conceptual Design Drawing is to reducetechnical uncertainty by verifying preliminary design and engineering concepts. Conceptual Design Drawings may not necessarily be accurate to scale, but they shall belegible and shall, as a minimum, disclose engineering design information sufficient toevaluate an engineering concept.  Layout drawings may be used to convey the engineeringconcept in such a manner that the engineering information is understandable to cognizantGovernment engineers and scientists or enable fabrication by the design Contractor ofdevelopmental hardware for test or experimentation.  The Contractor may imprint itsname/logo on a Conceptual Design Drawing.  A Conceptual Design Drawing may be deliveredas a hardcopy, and/or as an electronic copy, and/or in any other readable/reproducibleformat, at the Contractor's discretion. TASK 4:  REPORTSA.  The Contractor shall provide oral briefings (telecoms with the NASA COTR on abi-weekly schedule as determined by the NASA COTR) that are brief, factual, and informaland shall reflect the interests and concerns of the COTR. B.  The Contractor shall deliver monthly written reports that include preliminaryconceptual drawings, trade spaces considered, and progress for the month in accomplishingthe goals of this Purchase Order as follows:Report Format:All written reports shall follow the format describved below. Oral reports shouldreasonable apply the guidance that this format implies.  (a)  A cover page containing: (1)  Contract number, task order number and title.(2)  The type of report ("Monthly Technical Progress Report") and the period/unit beingreported.(3)  Contractor's name, address, and organizational segment generating the report.(4)  Signature of Contractor's cognizant Project Manager (or, if submittedelectronically, an unambiguous indicator that the Project Manager has generated/reviewedthe report).(5)  Date of issuance.(6)  Inclusion of the following statement:  "Prepared for NASA Glenn Research Center,Cleveland, OH  44135".(b)  Section I-- Technical Progress Summary:  A description of the work performed duringthe report period and the overall technical progress achieved.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Description:The Ocean and Coastal Resources Branch (OCRB) of the National Park Service's (NPS) Water Resources Division is a component of the NPS Natural Resource Program Center (NRPC).  OCRB was formed in 2007 to implement the NPS Ocean Park Stewardship Action Plan (2006).  One of the goals of the Plan is to increase NPS technical capacity for the exploration and protection of NPS ocean and coastal resources.  An important component of increasing such technical capacity is the description and analysis of NPS jurisdiction, authorities, boundaries, and remedies.OCRB works closely with the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD), another division within the Natural Resource Program Center, in all aspects of implementing the Ocean Park Stewardship Plan, including the implementation of the goal and component described above.  GRD provides parks, regions, networks, and the NPS Washington Office with expertise on minerals management, disturbed lands restoration, geohazards, soil and geologic inventories, planning, and the management of specialized geologic resources such as caves and karst, fossils, and coastal resources.  The assistance provided by GRD often requires interpretation of statutes, regulations, case law, and policy, and the development of policy and guidance documents.  GRD policy/regulatory staff work closely with attorneys in the Department of the Interior Office of the Solicitor in these tasks.  At present, the number of ocean and coastal legal and regulatory issues warranting research and analysis outpaces the in-house capability of OCRB and GRD staffs.  As a result, OCRB and GRD seek to obtain assistance from a Contractor in conducting regulatory and legal research and developing analytical and guidance memoranda and other regulatory or legislative documents for ocean and coastal units of the National Park System.
Scope of Work:The Contractor shall prepare independent analyses and provide expertise related to NPS ocean and coastal legal and regulatory issues.  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide the NPS with all labor and services necessary to conduct the needed research and prepare the requested documents in electronic format.  The work must be performed in NPS GRD's Lakewood, Colorado office. 
Specific research and analytical needs include the following:1. Establishing, refining, and updating high-priority park unit boundariesThe Contractor will research and draft approximately 12, and up to 15, park unit-specific legal memoranda satisfactory to GRD, OCRB, the NPS Land Resources Division, and the Department of Interior Office of the Solicitor regarding the location and modification over time of the boundaries of particular ocean and coastal park units.  The park units included in this analysis will be those determined by OCRB, GRD, and other NPS offices as high-priority; that is, park units faced with sea/lake level changes, dynamic geologic features and processes, or other factors that necessitate analysis of that unit's boundary.  This task will require the Contractor to: (1) analyze park enabling statutes, other statutes, and other applicable documents such as deeds, maps, and agreements,(2) consult with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other agencies, (3) determine whether federal or state common law, or both, governs the legal outcome of geological shoreline processes in a given park such as erosion, reliction, and accretion, and(4) analyze the likely impacts of sea or lake level changes and seasonal fluctuations on park shorelines.The Contractor will need to travel to up to four NPS regional offices (the NPS Northeast Regional Office, the Southeast Regional Office, the Midwest Regional Office, and the Alaska Regional Office) during the performance of this task.  Estimated travel costs of $8,000 must be included in the quote.These memoranda will then be used by the NPS Land Resources Division to update park boundaries as warranted and feasible, and by GRD, OCRB, and other NPS offices to help parks apply available authorities within the updated boundaries.
2. Assistance with revisions to NPS general regulations and park jurisdictional status.The Contractor will research and develop input to the pending revisions of the regulations at 36 C.F.R. Part 2 and Part 4 by the NPS Office of Regulations and Special Park Uses, as those revisions potentially affect the management of the natural resources of ocean and coastal park units.  In addition, the Contractor will research the ocean and coastal-related implications of any concurrent jurisdiction obtained by the NPS within up to 5 areas of the National Park System.Specifically, the Contractor will:(1) Analyze the purpose, enforcement problems, or resource problems associated with existing NPS regulations, and identify whether any proposed regulations would solve those problems, and(2) Work with NPS law enforcement specialists and resource managers in analyzing the implications of any jurisdictional changes in up to 5 NPS units.
3. General Ocean and Coastal Park Jurisdictional GuidanceOCRB and GRD have recently completed a first draft of the NPS Ocean and Coastal Jurisdiction Handbook.  This handbook discusses and explains NPS authorities and policies regarding various issues in ocean and coastal parks as derived from NPS regulations, various statutes,  and case law.  Such issues include commercial and recreational fishing, aquaculture, commercial and recreational boating, invasive species, recreation, water quality, off-road vehicles, and sediment management.  The draft handbook is being reviewed by NPS staff as well as by attorneys in the Department of Interior Office of the Solicitor.  OCRB and GRD are receiving comments on the draft handbook, and may host a meeting with approximately nine attorneys in the Department of Interior Office of the Solicitor to discuss and resolve any lingering issues presented in the draft handbook.The Contractor will help GRD and OCRB finalize the handbook by:(1) Collecting and analyzing comments on the current draft of the NPS Ocean and Coastal Jurisdiction Handbook;(2) Researching any and all questions raised in comments received; and(3) Drafting or modifying language for inclusion in the final version of the handbook.
Qualifications of Key Personnel:Key Contractor Personnel should have a minimum of an advanced law degree such as a Master of Laws [L.L.M Degree] in Natural Resources and Environmental Law and Policy or equivalent experience.  In addition, key personnel must have substantial legal and policy expertise related to ocean and coastal issues with knowledge of issues facing the National Park System.  Key personnel are expected to have the appropriate legal training and background (or equivalent experience) in addition to experience in a natural resource work environment to successfully complete the Scope of Work.
Period of Performance:The period of performance for the base period of the contract is anticipated to begin effective date of the purchase order and conclude no later than July 31, 2011.
Place of Performance:Facilities and all computer hardware and software shall be provided by the National Park Service, Geologic Resources Division, at the Academy Place office located at 7333 W. Jefferson Avenue, Suite 450, Lakewood, CO 80235.
Government-Furnished Property:Equipment and materials that may be provided by GRD, OCRB, and other NPS offices for use exclusively related to the project include but are not limited to National Park Service files, records, publications, and maps related to the National Parks.  Furthermore, GRD shall supply office space, computer system, and telephone.The Contractor shall be responsible for the security and protection of government-furnished property provided to the Contractor in connection with this contract, and shall return all property to the government upon completion of this purchase order.  The government shall pay for and approve all shipping and handling arrangements for all government property.
Rights in Data:All material first produced in the performance of this contract shall be the sole property of the government. The Contractor shall not publish or produce such material in whole or in part, in any manner, or form, nor authorize others to do so, without the written consent of the Contracting Officer.
Deliverables:The Contractor will produce draft and final legal memoranda and other written analyses of NPS regulations, laws, policies, and administrative procedures.  All written products will be filed on a government-provided computer in park-named or other clearly-named folders, and will be in MS Word 2003 or 2007, MS Powerpoint, or MS Excel 2003 or 2007.The Contractor will also communicate via email. All emails containing information relevant to the Scope of Work described above will be filed in park-named or other clearly-named archives which are backed-up and readily accessible to government personnel.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate with General Electric Engine Services, Inc. (GEES) for Depot repair for T700-GE-401C and T700-GE-401 engines along with the Cold Section Modules (CSM) and Power Turbine Modules (PTM) for each series engine.  A modification will be issued to GEES  existing contract N00421-09-D-0008 to increase the maximum quantity of  reworked engines needed for the T700-GE-401C and T700-GE-401.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (in accordance with FAR 6.302-1) with GEES because they are the only company with authority or authorization to run the Data Reduction Program when testing engines on the test cell.  GEES proprietary test cell Data Reduction Program is a requirement for all depot reworked engines.  The Government does not own/possess the technical data that is utilized in the Data Reduction Program.   The test cell Data Reduction Progam was developed and is owned by General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) which is GEES parent company.  GEAE has not given Parts Manufacturer Authority (PMA) to any private company not owned by GEAE, making GEAE and GEAE-owned subsidiaries the only manufacturers for a majority of the parts necessary to rework/repair the T700-GE-401 engines and modules.  Questions or comments regarding this notice may be addressed electronically to   linda.cullison@navy.mil.  No phone calls will be accepted or returned.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. <br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 30 APR 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 30 APR 2010.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

GovPay Electronic Invoicing RequirementsPP05-05   May 3, 2005
All payment requests must be submitted electronically through GovPay.  "Payment request" means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment by a contractor.  To constitute a proper invoice, the GovPay payment request must conform to the requirements identified in FAR 32.905(b), "Payment Documentation and Process" and FAR 52.232-25, "Prompt Payment (OCT 2003)".  To ensure the timely processing of invoices, GovPay uses an automated "workflow" process to route invoices for review, approvals and payment; as required by the "Prompt Payment Act".
Support documentation shall be attached to the GovPay invoices in the form of "flat files" in American Standard Code for Information Interchanges (ASCII) and an adobe PDF file.  There is a 4MB limitation on file size for these attachments, per header or line item.  Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are NOT acceptable electronic forms for payment requests.
GovPay uses the contractor information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as one of the components for validating contractor registration.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to submit accurate and current CCR information.  Failure to register and maintain CCR information, or if it has expired, been suspended, been deleted, or could not be found, will result in rejection of your invoice.  An invoice submitted during the period for which information in the CCR could not be verified must be resubmitted for payment after successfully registering or updating registration in CCR.  Contractors are encouraged to review their CCR information to ensure the most current information is available for GovPay.
The CCR Assistance Center is available to provide assistance and answer questions.   They can be reached at 1-888-227-2423 or on the web at http://www.ccr.gov.
Detailed GovPay information for use of GovPay may be obtained on the Internet at www.govpay.gov.  This web site includes user manuals, training resources, and instructions for registration.

<DESC>Industry Day Announcement
<p>"The Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) in collaboration with the US Army will conduct a Competition (with a cash prizes for the winner/s) in order to foster the ability to clear training ranges of debris and unexploded ordnance (UXO) using robotic technologies. Experience to date with robotic range clearance suggests a significant potential for time and cost savings as well as increases in the safety for the personnel conducting this activity. The ultimate aim is to return to productive use the millions of acres currently encumbered with spent training rounds and debris. The Department of Defense (DoD) intends for this Competition to result in viable systems that can be procured and placed into service clearing ranges.</p>
<p>Given the expressed industry interest and capability, the Competition event will be preceded by a qualification requirement. Competitors looking to compete for the cash prize must first demonstrate a viable robotic system capable of safely executing tasks inherent in clearing UXO ranges. Assuming a sufficient quantity of competitors qualify to participate in the Competition, the DoD will award $2M in cash prizes against the various competition categories and pursue a separate procurement contract to purchase robotic range clearance systems or services. Both the qualification trials and the Competition will be held at Camp Guernsey, WY.</p>
<p>An Industry Day for the Competition will be held on Thursday, 10 December in Building 9706 at Tyndall AFB, FL. Information will be provided by DoD relating to the conduct of the Competition to include the provisional Rules and Metrics of the Competition, the follow on IDIQ contract, and robotic demonstrations related to UXO clearance. The agenda will include a Competition Overview, plans for the follow on IDIQ contract, a range clearance process overview, logistics information about Camp Guernsey, a review of the provisional Rules and Scoring Criteria associated with the Competition, robotic demonstrations related to UXO clearance, and a tour of AFRL Robotics Range Clearance systems. Space will also be provided if attendees would like to distribute information on their company.</p>
<p>Pre-registration is required by Thursday, 3 December, and can be done through the following website: <a href="http://www.roboticrangeclearance.com">www.roboticrangeclearance.com</a>. Additional information including directions shall be provided through the website. Any questions should be directed through the website. <br /><br />Letters of Intent (LOI) to compete in the Robotic Range Clearance Competition are available on this FBO&nbsp;announcement and the following website: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.roboticrangeclearane.com">www.roboticrangeclearane.com</a>.&nbsp; LOIs&nbsp;are required in order to compete and must be submitted no later than 5:00 PM (Eastern) 3 May 10. LOIs should be submitted to Bruce Donalin&nbsp;via e-mail (<a href="mailto:bruce.donlin.ctr@osd.mil">bruce.donlin.ctr@osd.mil</a>) or fax (703) 695-3063.&nbsp;</p>

2. Technical Requirement Two:
Content Aware Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Background:
This Data Loss Prevention (DLP) initiative is one component of an overall Department of State security and privacy strategy.

DLP will support an in-depth of monitoring of user-generated information not currently performed by the Department. Currently, the Departments Sensitive but Unclassified Network (OpenNet) uses a notification (warning banner) that provides necessary and sufficient notice to users of the monitoring of their activity against all IT resources and networks. 

Federal workplace privacy law uniformly permits unlimited monitoring of employee use of IT resources. It is unlikely that employees now expect actual word-by-word inspection of content of emails and files to detect the presence of sensitive data such as social security numbers (SSNs), credit card numbers, and other PII. DLP will (1) reduce the risk of exposure of information sent by unsecured e-mail outside of OpenNet; (2) monitor the writing of sensitive files to removable media located on the desktop; and (3) detect sensitive information on servers that may no longer serve a business purpose. 

The objective of this section of the RFI is to identify specifications for a DLP capability that will support the Department in meeting the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Federal Information and Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements listed below.

NIST
Draft-SP800-122.pdf;
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html

FISMA 
http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf

OMB 06-16:

Issued in June of 2006, this memorandum encouraged the completion of a checklist for the protection of remote information, and provided additional recommendations for protecting PII being stored or transported offsite and accessed remotely. OMB also recommended that all departments and agencies implement protections for remote access to PII by:

 Encrypting all PII (if remote storage is permitted) or removing all PII (if it is not)
 Tracking the download of database extracts to laptops and removable media that contain PII 
 The removal of this data 90 days after it is no longer needed.

These recommendations became mandatory with the subsequent release of M-07-16.

http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/memoranda/fy2006/m06-16.pdf

OMB M-06-19:
Issued in July of 2006, updates a Federal Information and Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 requirement that agencies report security incidents to a Federal Incident Response Center (US CERT) located within the Department of Homeland Security.

http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/memoranda/fy2006/m06-19.pdf

OMB M-07-16:
Issued in May of 2007, makes mandatory the guidelines that were initially outlined in M-06-16 regarding the use of encryption and other security controls. The memorandum also introduces new privacy requirements, calling for agencies to review and reduce the volume of personally identifiable information, in particular the collection and use of social security numbers. In addition, this memorandum modifies certain aspects of the data loss reporting requirements outlined in M-06-19, and requires agencies to develop and implement a breach notification policy within 120 days.

http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf

2.2 Data Loss Prevention Software Requirements:  

Performance
The Department of State has 70,000 global users.  
Performance / Scalability.  List five Data Loss Prevention reference customers with more than 50,000 DLP users.
Full DLP Scalability.  Indicate at least two of the 50,000 user DLP references that are using Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP.  (Sometimes referred to as Large Data Store Discovery; DLP is also referred to as Datacenter or Storage DLP.)

Overall Viability
DLP Market Share.  As part of overall risk mitigation, the Department of State evaluates vendors partially based upon previous success, including market share.  What is your DLP market share as designated by a major industry analyst (i.e. Gartner, Forrester, IDC, Burton Group)?

Government Certifications
FIPS 140-2.  How does your DLP solution meet U.S. Federal Government FIPS 140-2 encryption requirements across all databases and system-to-system communication?
OMB M-06-16/M-07-16.  Database Extracts.  The Department of State has 75 systems listed under the Privacy Act with sensitive information.  How does your solution meet OMB M-06-16 and M-07-16 requirements for finding and protecting sensitive database extracts from all Privacy Act systems?  

Integrated Management
The Department of State seeks a unified DLP system to minimize IT and operational system management and operational costs.  The following questions apply to a full Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discover DLP configuration.
Policy Console.  It is the Department of States requirement that all DLP privacy and security policy definitions across Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP are defined in one console.  
Reporting Console.  It is the Department of States requirement that all DLP privacy and security reporting across Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP be managed from one console.  

Integration with Department of State Infrastructure
Database.  Most enterprise Department of State systems with a database use an Oracle database. 
How many databases are required or incorporated within your system for a customer using Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP?
Are there any non-Oracle databases in your DLP solution?  
If there are any non-Oracle databases, how many and what type? Are all databases provided by DLP vendor?  Is all database support provided by the DLP vendor support?
iPost.  The Department of State is using its own systemiPost--for integrated SCAP and IT system reporting.  How can your DLP system provide reporting information to iPost?
LDAP.  The Department of State seeks to minimize IT integrations.  Does your system require one or two LDAP integrations for full integration across, Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP?
Web Proxies.  The Department of State uses BlueCoat web proxies.  Is your solution a BlueCoat certified solution for Network DLP message blocking?
Remedy.  The Department of State uses Remedy for IT help desk ticket management.  Does your solution have out-of-the box integration with Remedy to generate IT tickets based upon any DLP policy violating incident?  

Integration with Department of State Operations
Federated Model.  The Department of State has multiple bureaus and offices, such as Consular Affairs, Administration, Resource Management, Diplomatic Security, etc.  Explain how your DLP solution provides a federated role based security control with limits for incident access for a role by policy, by department bureau, by country or geography, by severity or remediation status, or by any user-defined custom attribute?  For example, would/could only within Foreign Service Officers be provided access to see DLP incidents attributed to Foreign Service personnel?
Privacy Control.  As per Department of State privacy policy and experience, contractors and other individuals are not to be given access to other DoS employees privacy data.  Explain how your DLP solutions provides privacy control with redaction of certain DLP incident data (such as sender email address, username, and sensitive incident content) from specific users such as contractors who may be first-level incident responders/analysts?
Severity and Escalations.  As per Department of State experience, some DLP incidents may be of higher severity than others due to content (such as classified data, VIP PII data) or amount of data in an incident (hundreds or thousands of records as opposed to a handful of records.)  
Severity Levels.  Does your DLP system provide different incident severity levels?  
Automatic Escalation.  Does your DLP system support automatic initiation of different notifications and remediation tasks based upon varying DLP incident severity level?  
Notifications.  The Department of State is required to automatically notify US-CERT and DS-CIRT for certain Network, Endpoint, or Large Data Store Discovery DLP incidents as per OMB M-06-19.  The questions below apply to Network, Endpoint, and Large Data Store Discovery DLP incidents, i.e. an employee writes policy violating data to a CD/DVD or emails policy violating data to ones personal email account.
US-CERT & State-CERT.  Does your DLP system support simultaneous notification of US-CERT and DS-CIRT for a particular type of DLP incident?
Simultaneous Notifications.  Does your DLP system support simultaneous notification of US-CERT, DS-CIRT, the Department of State Privacy Office, the employees manager, and system owner for a particular type of DLP incident?  

DLP Product / Service
Remediation.  The Department of State plans to incorporate automatic remediation of DLP incidents.
Network DLP Remediation.  The Department of State requires Network DLP component to automatically remediate network policy violations via blocking, forwarding to third- party encryption gateways, etc.  
Large Data Discovery DLP Remediation.  What automatic remediation actions (quarantine, encryption, etc.) does your solution provide for policy violating files found in Large Data Store Discover DLP?  Does your Large Data Store Discovery DLP remediation solution support more one certified encryption vendor today?  
Endpoint DLP.  The Department of State has over 60,000 endpoint laptops or desktops.   The DLP requirements below are for its Endpoint DLP use.
Content Aware.  The Department of State requires that Endpoint DLP detection be based solely based upon real-time file content data analysis, and not based upon previous tags or human tagging definitions.  
Audit & Control.  The Department of State requires the Endpoint DLP component to provide logging/audit as well as blocking capabilities for policy violating USB copies, CD/DVD copies, HTTP (such as webmail) transactions, IM, and FTP transactions.  
Pop-Up Notifications.  To reduce calls to helpdesk and other operations, the Department of State requires the Endpoint DLP component to provide pop-up information notifications for policy violating actions when in logging/audit mode and pop-up notifications for blocking actions.  
Endpoint Agent.  Does your DLP solution use more than one DLP agent for Endpoint Data Discovery, Audit, and Control? 
Endpoint Agent Deployment.  Does your solution support the use of SMS/SCCM to install agents? 
Endpoint Platform Support.  Does your Endpoint DLP solution natively support Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7?
Network DLP.  Department of State has multiple networks, including classified and unclassified networks.
Monitoring and Blocking.  The Department of State requires a Network DLP component to monitors all emails including attachments, HTTP including uploaded files, FTP, and all TCP/IP traffic.
Air Gap Security.  Describe how your solution can support the need to prevent classified data from entering the Department of States unclassified network.
Employee / User Notification.  The Department of State requires a Network DLP component to automatically notify employees of policy violating actions.  
Large Data Discovery DLP.  The Department of State has hundreds of terabytes of stored data and requires the DLP system to identify stored sensitive data as per the requirements below.
Identify Dormant Data.  The Department of State requires that Large Data Discovery DLP find sensitive stored data in forgotten files and systems on file servers.  Does your Large Data Discovery DLP natively mount each file server to scan for sensitive data?  Provide detail.  Additionally, does your Large Data Store Discovery DLP modify any of the file access or file modified dates?
File Information.  The Department of State plans to prioritize findings from Large Data Discovery DLP based upon such items as file Access Control Lists (ACL).  Does your solution display full Microsoft ACLs for policy violating files?
Enterprise Management.  So as not to impact Department of State network usage and operations, scheduling of Large Data Discovery scans is imperative.  Does your solution have the ability to schedule (including automatic pausing of scans) so that all scanning is during non-production hours?  
Undocumented Systems.  The Department of State is very concerned with undocumented systems with large amounts of sensitive data.  Does your solution scan Oracle, Microsoft, and IBM db2 databases for sensitive data?

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs Medical, Surgical and Prosthetic (MSP) Advanced Supply Chain Capability (ASCC) ProjectNotice Type:  Sources SoughtThe proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY (as defined in FAR 15.201(e)), this is not a solicitation. Solicitations are not available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is responsible for the procurement of approximately $3.4 billion in goods and services for the medical/surgical and prosthetic and sensory aids per year.  Currently the VA's enterprise MSP supply chain management is fragmented and is not able to efficiently manage current demand.  The VA is therefore in need of an improved and modernized integrated enterprise MSP supply chain management capability.Key VA organization levels include, but are not limited to, VA Medical Centers (VAMC), Veteran Integrated Services Networks (VISN), Regional/National Acquisition Centers, VA Health Administration (VHA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and supported field offices, VA Central Office (VACO), and the VA Program Management Office (PMO).The VA is requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of attracting healthcare supply chain management contractors to conduct an assessment of the VA's enterprise MSP supply chain management and provide an improved and modernized enterprise MSP supply chain management solution.  The assessment will result in a recommended solution which would detail professional services, information systems and any associated tools required to improve and modernize the VA's enterprise MSP supply chain management capability.  It is anticipated that only contractors with current commercially available or adaptable systems will be eligible for this effort.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION.  FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DUNS 007113228.  The modification addresses the following work:

These funds will be used to obtain technical assistance for the purpose of enhancing and accelerating the Federal Emergency Management Program (FEMP) service functions to the Federal government. Sandia Corporation will provide services in the following areas:Initial and/or feasibility of a particular technology; Project prioritization; Strategic energy planning and benchmarking; Technical reviews of designs and proposals; Energy audit training; High-performance green building technical support; Federal vehicle fleet technical support; Assessments; Retro-Commissioning; Resource Efficiency Energy Managers; Operations and maintenance; and Evaluate financial strategies, procurement specifications; and acceptance of installed systems. 

These funds will also be used by Sandia Corporation to work on the algae pond fluid dynamic modeling research with Sapphire Energy, Inc. Sandia has exceptional expertise in modeling the mechanics and chemistry in large fluidic systems that could be further applied to the design and study of algae cultivation ponds. Results will provide guidance in the design and development of the full commercial scale cultivation ponds.

The action is other than fixed price because work assigned to Sandia Corporation through the issuance of work authorizations (WA) is pursuant to the terms and conditions of their prime management and operating contract awarded under as a cost reimbursement type contract. This contract type was used due to the uncertainties in contract performance.  Cost cannot estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract as the exact nature and duration of the work is uncertain.  The use of a separate fixed price award to Sandia Corporation for the WA is inappropriate because this is issued under an existing cost reimbursable contract.  Sandia was selected by DOE to participate in this American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) work due to the expertise at Sandia National Laboratories in the subject matter.  The work falls within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy which is covered by the prime contract Statement of Work, paragraph 3.3, entitled Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy that states: The Contractor shall provide research, design and manufacturing capabilities for solar electric technologies (solar thermal and photovoltaic), wind energy, geothermal energy systems, industrial and transportation applications, fossil energy programs, electric power systems, hydrogen power technologies and battery systems for utilities and transportation.  

NOTE:  This action is awarded under prime contract modification no. 377 that recognizes WA no. FB-100003-20454-10 and WA no. BM-100003-20650-10 issued under Management and Operating Contract number DE-AC04-94AL85000.  This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars.

<DESC>Work consists of a clearing and spillway system maintenance project at Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (AIWW) Northern Disposal Areas 16, 19, and 21. The project will include improvements to Disposal Areas 16 and 19 in Hyde County, NC and Disposal Area 21 in Pamlico County, NC. Each of these sites are used for disposal of maintenance dredging material from the AIWW. Improvements are needed at each site to prepare them for disposal of dredged material during the next AIWW dredging cycle for the Alligator Pungo Landcut and the Hobucken Landcut. The existing dikes at each site need to be raised to provide dredged material capacity. Clearing and grubbing of the dike footprint and borrow areas will be required prior to dike raising. The borrow for dike raising at each site is available within the existing diked area. Seepage control systems will be installed at each disposal area. In addition to dike raising and seepage control system installation, the existing spillway risers and pipes will be replaced. The existing spillway risers and pipes will be removed and replaced with corrugated metal D Shaped risers and 36 diameter corrugated pipe supported on timber cribbing.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE<br />AIR COMBAT COMMAND
<p><br />JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>9th Contracting Squadron/LGCA2<br />6500 B Street, Suite 101<br />Beale AFB CA 95903-1712</p>
<p><br />I. This document constitutes justification and approval for an authorized by statute requirement that precludes full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of FAR 6.302-5. It is executed on behalf of 9 RW, Beale AFB, CA 95903-1712.</p>
<p>II. NATURE OF ACTION: Request for acquisition by other than full and open competition procedures to establish a new contract for base refuse services from one source due to an existing Exclusive Franchise Agreement with Yuba County, in which Beale AFB resides.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: Under the contemplated contract Recology Yuba- Sutter (YS) will provide services to collect and dispose of refuse and recyclable waste. The performance period for this effort will be from 1 April 2010 through 30 September 2010 to include 4 option years. The estimated cost for the base year including four option periods is $5,224,000.00.</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY: The statutory authority for this requirement is 10 USC 2304 (c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statute, as implemented by FAR 6.302-5.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION SUPPORTS STATUTORY AUTHORITY: The service being procured is refuse collection for Beale A.F.B. Beale A.F.B. is located within the confines of Yuba County, in accordance with the provisions set forth in 42 U.S. Code 6961(a)(2) Application of Federal, State, and Local Laws to Federal Facilities has declared "Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government (1) having jurisdiction over any solid waste management facility or disposal site, or (2) engaged in any activity resulting, or which may result, in the disposal or management of solid waste or hazardous waste shall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements..." Section 7 of Article 11 of the California Constitution, California Public Resources Code (PRC) Section 40059 authorizes the County of Yuba to determine all aspects of handling of solid waste that are of local concern Given these empowerments the Yuba County Board of Supervisors has entered into an Exclusive Franchise Agreement with YS for the collection of refuse within the corporate limits of Yuba County with an effective date of 2 July 1990. The existing contract, F04666-99-C-0005, was awarded on a Sole Source basis to YS on 28 January 1999. The existing Exclusive Franchise Agreement with Yuba County was utilized to obtain services from YSDI. The existing contract was awarded for the base year and nine (9) option years.</p>
<p>VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE: In an effort to ensure offers are solicited from as many sources as practicable the Regional Waste Management Authority was contacted to receive additional information with regards to the existing exclusive franchise agreement. Keith Martin, Administrator of the Regional Waste Management Authority, stated that YS uses the Marysville Transfer and Processing Station for waste coming from Beale AFB and after being sorted solid waste is taken to the Ostrom Road Landfill Facility. Mr. Martin also stated that the Ostrom Road Landfill Facility currently provides solid waste disposal services to both municipal and commercial customers in the northern Sacramento Valley including Yuba, Sutter, Butte, Nevada, and Colusa Counties. Furthermore YSDI is a subsidiary of Norcal Waste Systems, Inc. Norcal, Inc. has subsidiaries that service the nearby cities of Auburn, Oroville and Dixon.</p>
<p>VII. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: A determination of cost fair and reasonableness will be established by price analysis. The Government will compare prices established by YS and approved by the Yuba County Board of Supervisors with rates paid by nearby bases and cities. Additionally a PNM will be completed with a more detailed justification for the determination of price fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>VIII. MARKET SURVEY: N/A</p>
<p>IX. OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: Case law, Parola v. Weinberger, Nos. 86-2963; 86-15066; 87-1944 (9th Cir. June 1, 1988), The court rules that section 6001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requires federal installations to comply with local arrangements for solid waste collection and disposal, including exclusive garbage collection franchises. RCRA section 6001 (a) waives sovereign immunity for federal facilities with respect to federal, state, and local solid and hazardous waste disposal, including exclusive garbage collection franchises.</p>
<p>X. INTERESTED SOURCES: N/A</p>
<p>XI. FUTURE ACTION TO ENSURE COMPETITION: No actions are planned to ensure competition in the future due to the requirements set forth in 42 U.S. Code 6961(a)(2) Application of Federal, State, and Local Laws to Federal Facilities as prescribed above in section V. Future actions to ensure competition will be taken barring any changes made to 42 U.S. Code 6961.</p>
<p>XII. CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION: The contents of this justification are accurate and complete to the best of the knowledge and belief of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>XIII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION: N/A</p>

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open CompetitionAgency:  Department of Veteran's AffairsContracting Activity:	Acquisition Service Area Office East - 8			Orlando VA Medical Center,			5201 Raymond Street			Orlando, FL 328031.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The Orlando VA Medical Center has an ongoing program to furnish eye exams and eyeglass services to veterans that require them and are eligible for assistance. The service contract for these services expire on March 31, 2010.2.  The supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.A bridge contract for eye exams and eyeglasses will be awarded for a period of 6 months with one 6 month option to Eye Doctor's Optical Outlets for Orlando offsite service.3.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.The incumbent, Eye Doctor's Optical Outlets is a Small Business.  They have successfully provided these services for the past four years.  There have been no unfavorable performance reports in the period of our association.  4.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition. The required services are urgently needed to ensure the continuity of veteran's eyeglass prescriptions.  A lapse in service would pose a significant risk to the lives and welfare of veterans receiving care at the Orlando VAMC and its satellite clinics.5.  Actions, if any, the agency may take to remove/overcome barriers to competition before subsequent acquisitions.During the term of the bridge contract, a long-term contract with options will be solicited and awarded competitively in accordance with FAR and VAAR requirements.  This interim emergency coverage is required to ensure the continued availability of eye exams and eyeglass services.6.  Technical or requirements personnel certification.I hereby certify that the supporting data which is the responsibility of technical and requirements personnel, and which forms a basis for the justification, are accurate and complete.7.  Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.This procurement will be conducted under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(2), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  Delay in patient treatment would pose an unacceptable risk to the lives of veteran patients and could result in serious injury, financial or other injury to the Department of Veteran Affairs.  Additionally, it is unlikely that another source could staff, mobilize and begin contract performance in the short lead-time available.8.  Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FBO notice was or will be publicized.   A notice of the bridge contract will be publicized through FedBizOpps.  No other offers were requested and no other companies expressed an interest in this acquisition.   The long-term follow-on contract will be publicized and competed in accordance with FAR Parts 5 and 6.9.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. This is an on-going requirement; prior awards provide sufficient historical price data to support a determination of fair and reasonable price.     10.  Description of the market research conducted and its results, or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted (see FAR Part 10).  Market research was not conducted for the proposed bridge contracts.  It is unlikely another vendor could staff, mobilize and assume contract performance in the short lead time available.11.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed in writing an interest in the acquisition.Due to the urgency of the requirement, no other sources were available to meet the turn around time requirements, and no other sources expressed in writing an interest in this acquisition.12.  Contracting Officer's certification.I hereby certify that the above justification for other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.ANITA K.
