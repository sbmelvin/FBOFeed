<DESC><strong>Provision of final funding for this project is contingent on a cost-share agreement with local entities</strong>
<p>General Description of Work<br />The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) is issuing a solicitation (negotiated) for the purpose of rehabilitating approximately 19,730 linear feet of the existing sewer pipeline known as the Trunkline and International Outfall Interceptor (IOI) in Nogales, Arizona with an option to rehabilitate an additional 8,634 linear feet.</p>
<p>The existing sewer pipeline, consisting of the Trunkline and the IOI, was installed between 1970 and 1971 and is comprised of unlined, reinforced and unreinforced concrete pipe that ranges in size between 24 inches and 42 inches in diameter. The Trunkline extends approximately 11,240 linear feet from Manhole No. 1 at the United States/Mexico border to Manhole No. 37, from which the IOI begins and extends about 32,196 linear feet to Manhole No. 99 at the Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Plant (NIWTP). The pipeline is approximately 46,436 linear feet in total length and has over one-hundred (100) manholes within its alignment. Currently, domestic and industrial wastewater generated in Nogales, Sonora is conveyed north through the main collector line in Mexico and across the border into Nogales, Arizona, where Mexican wastewater is eventually combined with Arizona wastewater in the Trunkline and the IOI for treatment at the NIWTP and discharge into the Santa Cruz River.</p>
<p>The rehabilitation of the Trunkline and IOI is subdivided in to five phases. The work under this Contract is limited to the Phases 1 and 2 of the project with an option to perform Phase 3 and includes rehabilitation of the sewer pipeline and manholes within these segments only. Phase 1 extends from Manhole No. 85 to Manhole No. 99 adjacent to the NIWTP and is approximately 8,556 linear feet with 16 manholes requiring rehabilitation within its alignment. Phase 2 extends from Manhole No. 1 to Manhole No. 37 and is approximately 11,174 linear feet with 22 existing manholes requiring rehabilitation within its alignment. Phase 3 option extends from Manhole No. 37 to Manhole No. 51 and is approximately 8,634 linear feet with 18 manholes requiring rehabilitation within its alignment.</p>
<p>The work is located in Santa Cruz County, Arizona. A site visit date will be listed in the solicitation. The work will be performed under NAICS Code 237110. The contract will be firm-fixed price.</p>
<p>Major Construction Tasks<br />The major construction efforts for rehabilitation include the following tasks:<br />1.	Bypass pumping to maintain sewerage conveyance during rehabilitation;<br />2.	Sewer line cleaning;<br />3.	Television inspection of sewer line;<br />4.	Installation of Cured-in-Place Pipe (CIPP);<br />5.	Installation of Protective Lining Systems in concrete manholes;<br />6.	Rehabilitation of manholes using Carbon Fiber Composite; <br />7.	Installation of new sanitary sewer manholes; and<br />8.	Raising of existing manholes to grade by the use of grade rings or new precast concrete manhole sections.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the project is more than $10,000,000.</p>
<p>The work is located within various Right-of-Ways (ROW), including the City of Nogales, the Arizona Department of Transportation, Santa Cruz County, and Union Pacific Railroad, and also located within private property. The Contractor shall be responsible for coordinating the work within the various ROWs and private property, and for obtaining all necessary permits and rights of entry for all work required under this Contract before beginning construction within each respective ROW or private property.</p>
<p>The work is located completely within the United States, but a portion of the work is<br />directly adjacent to the international border with Mexico. The Trunkline/IOI is periodically used for illegal drug trafficking across the border. The Contractor shall fully cooperate with the directions of the staff of the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) in the event of a security alert and may be required to stop work for any security reasons in the area. Additionally, the Trunkline between Manhole Nos. 1-13 within the existing covered floodway is restricted and Contractor shall have to coordinate with the City of Nogales and CBP for access.</p>
<p>This project requires work to be conducted in the vicinity of or within the Potrero Creek and Nogales Wash, both of which are considered Waters of the United States. Both the Potrero Creek and Nogales Wash, as well as their tributaries, are listed by the ADEQ as 303[d] Impaired Waters. The Contractor shall comply with the requirements and conditions of the USACE Nationwide Permit (NWP) No. 12, Utility Line Activities and the ADEQ Clean Water<br />Act 401 Water Quality Certification (WQC).</p>
<p>Performance Period<br />All work shall be completed within five hundred seventy (570) calendar days after the Notice to Proceed. An additional two-hundred ten (210) calendar days shall be provided if the option for Phase 3 is also awarded. The time stated for completion shall include final cleanup of the premises.</p>
<p>The work located within the Potrero Creek and Nogales Wash, as well as their tributaries, shall not take place during the monsoon season. Monsoon season typically runs from June 15 to September 30.</p>
<p>The solicitation, plans, and specifications are expected to be posted on or about July 23, 2018 (this is a target date which may slip or change; if the solicitation is not posted on Federal Business Opportunities by July 23, 2018 that is because the solicitation is not available for posting). The solicitation will be available for a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days.</p>
<p>This is a Presolicitation Notice. The Solicitation will include information on how to obtain the plans and specifications. All responsible sources may submit a proposal to be considered by the Agency.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) hereby announces its intent to award a sole source contract to Medstar Health Research Institute (Strong Heart Study Laboratory Center), Penn Medical Laboratory, 6525 Belcrest Rd., Ste. 700, Hyattsville, MD. 20782 for the acquisition of archived blood samples and surveillance datasets on American Indians.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 621511, Medical Laboratories. The period of performance for this procurement is 90 days.</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this procurement is to conduct a study on American Indian communities to assess exposure to toxic metals and study the association with adverse health outcomes. Conducting studies on American Indians has many unique challenges, such as cultural and anthropologic diversity, geographic dispersion, small community size, and different governing bodies and structures. Therefore, such studies are very challenging in many aspects, including numerous administrative approvals at tribal and federal levels, operational and implementation difficulties, logistics challenges, and long periods of time. The most effective approach would be acquiring archived biological specimens collected from a large number of American Indians as part of past and existing longitudinal cohort studies. To our knowledge, the MedStar Health Research Institute, that serves as the Strong Heart Study (SHS) Laboratory Center, is the only entity that holds a large number of archived biological specimens collected from over 4500 American Indians as far back as 30 years ago. In addition, it has extensive morbidity and mortality surveillance on these American Indian participant from the time of specimen collection until present. Conducting a study using SHS's archived samples and up to 30 years of surveillance data would make it possible for ATSDR to achieve the goal of studying historical exposure to contaminants and associated health outcomes in American Indian, all within a short period of time (1-2 years).</p>
<p>Market research was conducted to find other vendors to meet our requirement, including extensive literature and internet searches on epidemiological studies on American Indian populations with potential archived specimens. None of the commercial biorepositories have a large number of whole blood samples taken from American Indians 30 years ago, nor any follow-up surveillance of the health outcomes of the participants from whom the blood samples were taken from. If other alternatives are selected, we would not be able to meet our goal of conduct a study on American Indian communities to assess past exposure to toxic metals and study association of past exposure with adverse health outcomes. Therefore, only MedStar Health Research Institute is the only vendor that can meet our specific requirements and provide a large number of archived specimens collected from American Indian participants several decades ago.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps.com. We will only issue a solicitation to the MedStar Health Research Institute. However, all responsible sources who believe they can meet these requirements, may submit their capabilities and/or qualifications to Tonya S. Justice, Contracting Officer, via email to TJustice@cdc.gov, no later than 10:00am eastern standard time on July 21, 2018. Reference solicitation number RFP #75D301-18-Q-68719 in the subject line of the email.</p>
<p><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and is solely in the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC><p>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION FOR<br />ACQUISITIONS UNDER THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD<br /><br />In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) and CFPB-COO-Proc-02-2017, Contract and Legal Reviews - Policy and Procedures, I hereby determine that the ServiceNow training listed on requisition CFP-20430-18-0002 is available from only one<br />source, and competition is precluded for the reasons indicated below. There are no substitutes.</p>
<p>This acquisition is restricted to the following source:</p>
<p>Company: ServiceNow, Inc.<br />Company Address: 8045 Leesburg Pike Suite 300 Vienna, VA 22182</p>
<p>Company Point of Contact and Phone Number: Rick Welther; 571-389-8072</p>
<p>The ServiceNow training is estimated not to exceed $59,812.75 and is required to be performed from date of award for 12 months.<br />The Bureau will be implementing a new service management system to replace<br />Remedyforce starting in the fall of 2018. Specific training of ServiceNow's platform, IT<br />Service Management, and Hardware Asset Management applications is required to prepare staff for engagement with the vendor implementation team, for planning and deploying new capabilities, and administering and maintaining the new system. Without training, engagement with the vendor implementation team, decision making, and administration of the system will be difficult due to lack of product knowledge.<br /><br />Specific characteristics of the ServiceNow Training that limit the availability to a sole source are ServiceNow is the only vendor that provides training for all three (3) courses (ServiceNow Fundamentals, ITSM Fundamentals, and Hardware Asset Management Fundamentals). This is the only vendor that provides a specific ITSM training course geared towards capabilities within the entire package. Other vendors only provide general training of individual components that are in ITSM (fragmented). Also, no other vendor provides hardware asset management training. A search in Google for "ServiceNow hardware asset management training" returned only one result (out of 49 results) called "hardware Asset Management Fundamentals" and is conducted by ServiceNow, Inc.<br /><br />The material or service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit, and function) with<br />existing systems. The Bureau is implementing the Service Now, Inc. Platform for IT<br />service management and asset management. Service Now, Inc. is the only vendor that<br />provides training on their platform; therefore their service is the only one compatible.</p>

<p>No telephone requests will be accepted. Direct your requests and communication to Jay Hobbs, Contract Specialist, via email jay.hobbs@dla.mil.</p>
<p>This agency proposes to issue a solicitation for a long-term strategic/sole source contract, which will include multiple NSNs to support the UH-60 weapon systems. Five (5) NSNs are targeted to be added or repriced for this contract effort. The proposed sole source action will be issued to General Electric, Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE): 99207 and is intended to be on a sole source basis as supported by a J&amp;A IAW FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".</p>
<p>The proposed contract will be for a total of a three (3) year period of performance. Letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified OEM. This is proposed to be a FAR 15 effort. The proposed contract will be a firm fixed price with price redetermination Indefinite Quantity Contract for a three (3) year period. The attached lists of NSNs are the items that have been identified for this current action. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately.</p>
<p>These items are being added to contract SPMA4X-12-D-9422, awarded to The General Electric Company CAGE Code: 99702 in accordance with the originally approved J&amp;A. However, the NSNs identified here were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort. The contract has a maximum of 3 years remaining through August 2021. The contract requires supply of parts, as well as other functions including but not limited to inventory management, forecasting, distribution, storage, reliability improvements, engineering maintenance and design control affecting these parts.</p>

<DESC>A.  ANNOUNCEMENT

In accordance with A.M.S. 3.2.1.3.12 of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS), industry is hereby informed that the FAA Office of Acquisition Policy and Oversight, Cost/Price Analysis Services Division, requires support services to provide cost and price analysis services for agency Acquisition and Contracting Directorate Offices.  These offices are responsible for acquisition services covering a variety of procurements from non-complex to highly complex major systems acquisitions.

B.  SCOPE 

These services include, but are not limited to: provide cost and price analyses for both competitions and single source procurements, reconcile internal financial records, support internal and external financial audit activities, assist in preparation of Government Cost Estimates, and assist Contracting Officers Representatives (CORs) on projects and tasks related to project management.  A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to this Market Survey announcement.

The anticipated contract type is time & materials, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ). The period of performance will be a one-year base and three one-year option periods.  The estimated level-of-effort is approximately 15,000 hours per year for a total of 60,000 hours over the performance period.

The primary North American Industry Classification System Code for this requirement is:  541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services
($15.0 M size standard).

C.  PURPOSE

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The purpose of the market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from all business concerns.  Furthermore, this survey will aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition amongst eligible SDVOSBs or 8(a) business concerns or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement under other small business competition or full and open competition.  This process promotes competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other designated businesses to participate without issuing another market survey. 

The order of precedence for determining the nature of competition in the market survey is outlined below:

(a) Service-disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and 8(a)

(b) Small Business Concerns

(c) Full and Open Competition.

This is not a screening information request.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  Since this is for information and planning purposes, no evaluation letters or results will be issued to respondents.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  

In order to make the above determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

D.  HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS MARKET SURVEY

Interested vendors should submit the following items in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information:

1)	A one (1) page transmittal letter that includes:
a.	Company name and point of contact information (name, position, phone number, and company URL);
b.	Business size and type.  Identify if your firm is a small business (for which NAICS Codes), service disabled veteran-owned small business, 8(a) certified firm or a large business;
c.	Recommended NAICS code for this requirement; and DUNS number
d.	Identification of any existing contracts with your firm under which services of this type may be ordered within the FAA or under contracts with other federal agencies.

2)	A five (5) page Capabilities Statement that specifically identifies your experience in the types of services described below and in the scope of work.  This document should address:

a.   Type of services provided by your firm; 
b.   Size/value and type of services provided by previous contracts similar in  
      scope.  Provide specific contract numbers, contact names, addresses and email

     described in the SOW.

3)	Work Samples.  Copies of two (2) reports prepared by your firm for cost and price analysis services (no page limitation).  You may redact references to the company names/contract numbers as these documents may reference proprietary financial/rate information.  No other information should be redacted.

a.  Cost/Price analysis performed for a competitive procurement, or
b.  Cost/Price analysis performed for a single source, negotiated procurement or

<p>We wish to establish a service contract to measure 1,300 candidate proteins in 122 serum and urine specimens from 61 Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes who underwent serial kidney biopsy. Measurements will be done on a SOMAscan platform located at the Washington University School of Medicine. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide these specific laboratory services to the Chronic Kidney Disease Section, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  This contract will allow us to comprehensively evaluate the role of these proteins and compare them with expression patterns in kidney tissue from Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes. We want to determine which of these candidate proteins are related to underlying mechanisms of kidney disease and could be used as biomarkers for the disease.</p>
<p>We will combine these SomaScan data with longitudinal tissue expression data from our Pima Indian participants that were generated previously by the University of Michigan and provided to us for analysis.  Together, these data will help us identify the causal relationships between these markers and the progression of diabetic kidney disease.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Detachment
 NAS SIGONELLA ITALY

1.0	Description

1.1	The Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Detachment is requesting information regarding the installation of bird netting and bird prevention measures as specified in the requirements below.

2.0	Existing CCTV system description

2.1	Building 546 on NAS 2 is currently equipped with bird spikes which are affixed to fire sprinkler system under the roof within the building 546 compound to prevent birds from landing.  The current system is has not been effective because there are still many horizontal areas available for the birds to roost, and the spikes frequently fall off.  
The roof and the area under the roof have the following characteristics:
-	The roof is constructed of a corrugated sheet metal type material which leaves hundreds of gaps, approximately 4 inch by 6 inch, across the edges of the roof.
-	Many of the gaps along the roof edges have been covered with sheet metal, but there are still a large amount of holes that need to be covered.
-	There is a fire extinguishing system exposed underneath the roof, which is fully exposed and presents an opportunity for birds to roost and nest.
 The fire system is mounted to the roof and is hanging from the roof.  There are bird spikes affixed to the fire system with ties and glue.
-	There is lighting that is also under the roof, affixed in a similar fashion as the fire extinguishing system, and also presents an opportunity for birds to roost and nest.
-	There are also horizontal items lower on the walls under the roof, which allow an opportunity for birds to roost and nest, which will also need a solution to prevent birds from landing.

2.2	During the past years, given the bird infestation problem, there is a constant health hazard present for workers.  The bird feces causes damage to equipment which is stored under the roof, and hundreds of hours are consumed every year in the performance of cleanup and feces removal in addition to the added maintenance that must be performed to damaged equipment.

3.0	Requested Information

3.1	The Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Detachment is requesting information regarding the installation of a full bird prevention system, which will not allow the birds to roost and/or nest under the roof area of the building 546.

3.2	The purpose of this RFI is to install bird netting or other material required to meet the following needs:
-	Devise a complete solution which involves installing durable materials that will prevent the roosting and/or nesting of birds underneath the roof of building 546.
-	Any bird netting or wire mesh system utilized must include access panels so that maintenance can be performed to the existing fire extinguishing system, lighting, electrical panels, and any other points that would normally need to be accessed to perform routine maintenance.
-	All holes which might allow birds to access the area under the roof, must be sealed off to prevent birds from entering the area.
-	Devise a solution for any other items underneath the roof that would allow birds to roost or nest, so that there is no opportunity for birds to land anywhere underneath the roof.
3.3	The contractor shall provide, if needed, a solution that meets the minimum needs and is in compliance with local/regional regulations.
3.4	The contractor shall provide a solution to ensure that regular maintenance can still be performed on integrated facility (fire system, lighting, electrical fixtures, etc.) items which will be blocked by bird prevention measures.
 
3.5	The contractor shall be complete all work by 15NOV18.

<p>Communications Center (PRO) <br />ATTN: DANIELLE DONALDSON<br />245 Murray Lane, SW<br />Bldg. T-5<br />Washington, DC. 20223</p>
<p>Responses to the RFI are to be submitted electronically. See Paragraph 9.0, below.</p>
<p>3.0 Purpose</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. This RFI is being conducted pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.201(e). No contract will be awarded from this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or any obligation on the part of the Government. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S Government to form a binding contract. The USSS is not at this time seeking proposals, nor will it accept unsolicited proposals. The Government will utilize the information provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for a possible future requirement. Failure to respond to this requirement does not preclude participation in the anticipated RFP (if issued).</p>
<p>Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.</p>
<p>4.0 Description</p>
<p>The United States Secret Service (USSS) is seeking candidates/vendors to collect Personal Identifying Information (PII) of event applicants pursuant government data security requirements and create credentials with numerous security features to include RFID and/or biometrics for large major events (&gt;30,000 credentials).</p>
<p>The USSS is in the process of reviewing its current requirement, processes and capabilities as it relates to a wide range of credentialing. Vendors will be expected to travel domestically and rarely overseas for extended periods (customary average equals less than a 30 day period). A comprehensive background investigation of vendor personnel and production facilities would be required (if a RFP is issued).</p>
<p>The USSS seeks a vendor who could provide development, data management, software, and access control device (credential and underlay) production facilitation and support as well as project management coordination. During "on-site" requirements of a major event, the vendor shall continue operations and perform at TBD designated event location(s) for an approximate 15 to 30 days for each event.</p>
<p>At the direction of the USSS, the vendor would collaborate and correspond with government and non-government organizations to create credential applicant software and supportive documentation to facilitate data retrieval, applicant name check formatting, credential production, and ultimate distribution. In addition, upon approval from the USSS, the vendor may need to pre-supply access control tools (lanyards, protective credential and underlay pocket sleeves, etc.) and/or pre-produce access control devices (to include credentials and underlays) in support of all events. The clearance level for this RFI is unclassified, however all personnel, both prime and subcontractor, working under this requirement must be a U.S. citizen. If a RFP is issued, all vendor personnel involved, including on-site support must undergo a comprehensive security background check.</p>
<p>5.0 Background</p>
<p>The USSS assumes the lead role in coordination of operational security plans for all designated National Special Security Events (NSSE). Among the areas of advance planning and coordination is event access control. The USSS Credentialing Section is responsible for design, procurement and production of temporary special event credentials. In support of these responsibilities, the USSS is researching potential vendors to facilitate and streamline the vetting of attendance data. Once the information is vetted, the Government would approve credential production for individuals attending specific events. The credential allows security officials to quickly determine identification of the person and access level of the individual. The vendor will accomplish all aspects of event management to include industry-standard data collection as well as facilitation of design, production and distribution of credentials for events of national significance. The vendor will incorporate industry-standard security technologies, such as radio frequency transmitters and biometrics and will supply associated equipment and fully encrypted connections as required by current government information technology security standards. The vendor shall configure non-commercial web application software for users to interact and create engagements or appointments that build databases and custom web forms while allowing for the sharing of documents. Software should be specific to each event to automate the collection, management, and communication of applicant/credential information while complying with government prerequisite privacy and data security requirements. The vendor shall provide continual access and technical support of the software and will provide an experienced technician capable of software update installation, system maintenance and software solutions.</p>
<p>6.0 RFI Objectives and General Requirements</p>
<p>6.1 Objectives</p>
<p>This RFI is a request for interested parties to describe their capabilities and/or demonstrated experience with information on vendors who have solutions to efficiently create 1) high-quality, 2) multi- purpose, 3) secure credentials, which over time, should be 4) adaptable to allow for additional options and enhancements. Vendors are encouraged to identify unique solutions and ideas (including innovative processes) that will result in more efficient production and PII collection solutions.<br />The security model for the vendor will be founded on OMB, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), the Privacy Act of 1974, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Management Directive (MD) 4300A, The Sensitive Systems Handbook, which is used as the baseline for a number of Government-wide initiatives. FIPS 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems, is a mandatory Federal standard by NIST in response to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA). To comply with the Federal standard, the vendor will determine the security category of the vendor information system(s) in accordance with FIPS 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems&cedil; and derive the information system impact level from the security category in accordance with FIPS 200. The vendor will then apply, at a minimum, the appropriately tailored set of baseline security controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53, which in combination help ensure that appropriate security requirements and security controls are applied to all Federal information systems.</p>
<p>6.2 General Requirements</p>
<p>The vendor must have extensive major event management and access control performance, experience and client satisfaction during a recently designated NSSE or a major event equivalent to an NSSE (NSSEs are typically defined as events attended by large numbers of people (&gt; 30,000), often including the President of the United States and other high ranking U.S. government officials and world leaders, the object of intense media attention and public scrutiny, and an event of national significance that represent the political, economic, military, or cultural strengths of the United States.); be able to provide pre-event and on-site project management with the majority of technical and administrative staff having prior successful NSSE or equivalent major event access control performance(s), the ability to implement all required access control personnel, services, equipment, and supplies for a major event within a limited time period (possibly twenty-four hours' notice) and effectively operate at temporary TBD "on-site" location(s) for an approximate 15 to 30 days.</p>
<p>The USSS will conduct a comprehensive background investigation of all vendor personnel. The USSS has the right to request exclusion of any personnel from government projects and/or events for any reason. Employees with warrants, numerous felony arrests, or a felony conviction will be excluded. Due to required confidentiality laws and privacy issues, the vendor will not be provided an explanation if an employee is denied.</p>
<p>The vendor's facility shall also be equipped with physical security measures to safeguard generated hardware, equipment and/or devices utilized by the Government for imminent events. Physical security involves the use of multiple layers of interdependent systems which include CCTV, security guards, protective barriers, locks, alarms, motion detectors, access control protocols, and many other techniques. Once access device production for the Government has begun, the facility should be equipped with a safe, vault and/or secure area to protect produced credentials, underlays and /or additional devices. If a RFP is awarded government representatives will periodically perform on-site survey(s) of vendor facilities for compliance. The vendor will be briefed on the results of the on-site facility survey and given two weeks to mitigate any identified security risks. In addition, the government will routinely require for government personnel to be on-site at the vendor's facility upon production of Government access devices to ensure access control accountability and help manage pre-event correspondence and planning efforts.</p>
<p>7.0 Acquisition Strategy</p>
<p>A contract is not being solicited nor awarded from this announcement; however, in the event that the Government proceeds toward a solicitation/award, a firm fixed-price contract would be most likely. Responses may include potential firm fixed-price CLIN structures for use in a possible RFP.</p>
<p>8.0 Inquiries</p>
<p>All questions regarding this RFI must be submitted, in writing via email to danielle.donaldson@usss.dhs.gov. Questions will be addressed within a reasonable amount of time, generally no more than 48 hours after receipt. All questions are due by July 31, 2018 @ 2:00pm (eastern).

Statement of Requirements: BPA for Surgical Lights, Booms and Integration Systems for the future renovation of St. Louis VA s inpatient surgery suite (4D)
This request for information uses a Brand Name or Equal Description of the product required.  This permits prospective contractors to offer products other than those specifically referenced by brand name.  All offers must work with the existing equipment that has already been purchased and is currently in use at the station.  
Background: The St. Louis VA (John Cochran Division) is currently in the process of designing and eventually renovating the inpatient surgery suite of the VA Medical Center.  This multi-phase renovation plan will ultimately renovate 10 OR rooms.  Every single one of these rooms will require a new surgical lighting, ceiling-mounted equipment management system (booms), and a digital OR integration system to improve information access and modernize the surgery suites.  
Description: The Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) aims to streamline and standardize the purchase of the surgical lights, booms and integration system during the multiple phases of this large renovation project.  The procurement of this equipment will involve major coordination with the project engineer of the VA.  This will include involvement in various meetings in order to provide recommended design solutions, provide design drawings for the construction team and provide visual graphics/demos of all the equipment.  After the equipment required for each OR is determined and ordered, the VA will require the contractor to coordinate with the VA Project Engineer and construction team to deliver the equipment, install the equipment, verify performance of the system, and provide end user support/training. Further detail of the summary of services and equipment specifications can be seen in the following sections.  Additionally, a table with the line items expected out of this BPA can be seen at the bottom of this document.  
Scope of Requirements: 
The goal of this BPA is to provide St. Louis VA with a list of equipment that provides surgical lights, ceiling-mounted equipment management system (booms), and a digital OR integration system.  This list of equipment should have an associated price for each piece of equipment to allow the St. Louis VA to purchase from the list in coordination with the equipment that is required for each individual OR.

Equipment Definitions

Surgical Lights
The term  surgical lights  is used to describe the light head, including the light bulbs, wiring and housing that provides direct illumination over the patient during surgery.  Each surgical light head is affixed to an arm that is mounted to the ceiling. 
Light head   surgical grade light
Camera-ready light head   light head that is capable of supporting a video camera.  Light head is pre-wired for video capability and the camera can  plug and play  into the light head

Booms
The term  booms  is used to describe the general ceiling-mounted equipment management system.  The system is composed of the mounting hub and the arms.  The arms are capable of multiple degrees of articulation and positioning within the operating room and terminate in a unique item, such as an equipment carrier, a surgical light, a monitor, an anesthesia hookup, or a perfusion hookup.  Definition are as follows:
Mounting hub   Infrastructure located within the ceiling that safely supports the weight and articulation of the arms.  Multiple mounting hubs may be required in each operating room and multiple arms can extend from a single hub. 
Anesthesia Hookup Arm   provides the utilities and gases commonly used by an anesthesia machine.  This arm is not a fixed column from the ceiling, but rather an arm to tether to the anesthesia machine. 
Equipment Carrier Arm   Provides storage of the surgical equipment and utilities and gases commonly required during surgery.  This usually consists of a column with multiple shelves, power outlets and medical gasses.  
Perfusion Hookup Arm   Provides utilities and gases commonly used by a heart-lung machine.  This arm is not a fixed column from the ceiling, but rather an arm to tether to the heart-lung machine, without lifting the machine off the floor. 
Monitor Arm   An arm that supports a flat panel surgical display monitor of varying size.  This does not include the monitor itself.  
Surgical Light arm   Supports one surgical light head.  Each arm terminates with one light head. 

Integration System
The term  Integration System  refers to the solution for digitalizing the OR such that disparate medical equipment is integrated into one system to improve access to information, including digital images, medical record test results.  Additionally, available video, audio and clinical information system signals are integrated and routed into one system that can be controlled and manipulated by the user through a graphical interface.

<p>Notice Type: <br />Special Notice</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />Announcement.</p>
The U.S. Army will hold a tactical network related Technical Exchange Meeting on 8 May 2018 in Seattle, Wa. The goal of the event is to assist traditional industry partners, non-traditional industry partners, and academia in identifying and aligning their research efforts with Army tactical network modernization priorities as it relates to distributed mission command at the tactical edge. <br /><br />This events' focus is specific to enabling Army units to operate with elastic compute and storage in a disrupted, intermittent, and latent network environment. This event is meant for a technical audience to include software engineers, architecture experts, researchers, and integrators. The day will be spent discussing, in detail, the current challenge areas and potential utilization for dynamic allocation of mission command data and fostering discussion with industry and academia to assess these problems in the context of a modern network at the tactical edge. Representatives from Army program offices and the Network Cross Functional Team will be part of the technical exchange forum. Forum registration will close on 27 April 2018.<br /><br />The event will have multiple sessions covering different topical areas of interest with sign-in beginning at 0800 and the event ending not later than 1630.
<p><br />INDUSTRY TECHNICAL EXCHANGE MEETING BACKGROUND AND FOCUS <br />The Defense Innovation Board, Army Senior Leaders, and stakeholders all recognize the potential for cloud to enable AIrtificial Intelligence (AI), high data computing, and reduce Size Weight and Power (SWAP) considerations for tactical operations. The Network Cross Functional Team with Army partners will host a distributed mission command/cloud computing technical exchange meeting as a means of exploring the art of the possible to meet Army network needs.</p>
<p>The intent of the session&nbsp;is to enhance our Government-and-industry communication and enable industry to respond quicker to critical emerging requirements with innovative technology solutions and partnerships. This event will serve as a collaborative session for industry Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and Government SMEs to delve&nbsp;into the challenges, future potential, and solutions to provide distributed computing at the tactical edge.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS<br />The Government hopes to use information and insights gathered in the event to answer and inform&nbsp;the following questions and conderations:<br /><br />1. Given a DIL environment, how can we more efficiently employ elastic compute and storage at the tactical edge?<br /><br />2. What are the current solutions to increase mobility and efficiently compute at the tactical edge, while reducing size, weight, and power?<br /><br />3. How do we best use cloud capabilities to improve user experience?<br /><br />4. What HCI strategies are available to best use cloud enabled analytics and multiple discrete data sources?<br /><br />5. How do we set conditions, given DIL, to build an elastic cloud architecture to improve decision making as the battlefield becomes increasingly instrumented (IoT)?<br /><br />6. How do we modernize our applications to exploit the advantages of cloud? Strategies for moving from discrete single platform applications move toward an elastic, scalable, resource sharing application environment.<br /><br />7. Strategies for real time protecting and preserving data, code integrity, and assured data voracity to support tactical decision making. <br /><br />8. How can cloud improve command post mobility and survivability?<br /><br />9. How could the Army employ cloud strategies to reduce total cost of ownership, improve affordability, and improve security?<br /><br />10. What cloud strategies could the Army insert in the present tactical architecture immediately?</p>
<p>INDUSTRY QUESTIONS<br />Industry questions will be permitted during the Technical Exchange Meeting; however, questions in regards to any portfolio system in current source selection will not be allowed. The Army will make every effort to answer all questions posed&nbsp;during the forum. Additionally, you may submit topical questions prior to the&nbsp;event as part of the registration RSVP form. There is an area on the form for you to submit questions.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS<br />In order to obtain maximum participation from industry, vendors are limited to 3 personnel per company or major subsidiary. It is not required to have participated in a previous Industry Day/Forum or be a current Army vendor in order to register for this event. Registration for the&nbsp;event must be submitted by not later than 1300 ET on 27 April 2018 via email to CPT Adam Grines at adam.c.grines.mil@mail.mil with a carbon copy to Ms. Shahaadah Nalls at shahaadah.c.nalls.civ@mail.mil.

<CONTACT>Kelly E. Gray, Contract Specialist, Phone 7323232287, Email kelly.gray1@navy.mil
<DESC>The NAVAIR Cyber Warfare Detachment is soliciting technical/cost proposals for research support in technologies that are applicable to Resilient Cyber Warfare Capabilities for NAVAIR Weapon Systems.<br />The NAVAIR Cyber Warfare Detachment (CWD) develops and assesses cyber warfare capabilities for mission assurance and to defend NAVAIR weapon systems (aircraft, unmanned vehicles, weapons, sensors, etc.) and directly corresponding support systems (data link, mission planning, maintenance, logistic, etc.). The strategy of the CWD is to defend the access points to our weapon systems (detect, prevent), survive and continue to operate during close quarters battle (resilience and response), and to conduct cyber-smart acquisition to achieve this. The foundation of the CWD strategy for NAVAIR weapon systems is to develop the cyber workforce, invest in infrastructure and research and development (R&amp;D) and establish standards and best practices.
<p>The objective of this BAA is principally to orchestrate germane R&amp;D to fill the gaps in cyber warfare capabilities for NAVAIR weapon systems to achieve the CWD strategy, i.e., secure weapon systems able to survive and exploit cyber warfare. It is the finding of the CWD that there is a paucity of cyber R&amp;D and threat information for weapon systems and supporting systems that directly or indirectly "connect" to weapon systems. As well, most business systems Information Technology (IT) cybersecurity measures are mis-applied and ill-designed for weapon systems, especially given air vehicle Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) restrictions, and their operational environments. Therefore, this BAA solicits R&amp;D, not to simply apply IT solutions, concepts and underlying business environment assumptions, but to address cyber issues for weapon systems in a system of systems warfare environment with often intermittent or indirect "connectivity" to other systems. It is also a finding of the CWD that there has been little attention given to these intermittent connections, such as maintenance laptops, mission loaders, etc. As well, there has been little R&amp;D concerning critical physical and industrial control system interfaces with air vehicles, such as aircraft launch and recovery equipment (ALRE), power and navigation umbilical's. In fact, this BAA assumes that the cyber R&amp;D problem space for weapons systems even reaches back to concept development, supply chain management and software (SW) development and assurance / configuration management and as far forward as battle damage assessment (BDA) and equipment sanitization and disposal which all could involve anti-tamper as well.</p>
<p>It is assumed that R&amp;D efforts solicited by this BAA would address the most critical access point and resiliency (close quarters battle) issues for both legacy and future systems. However, this should not cause presumptive focus on any specific cybersecurity controls, concepts or preconceptions, i.e., the "Maginot line" effect. Traditional Information Assurance (IA) controls that assume continuous monitoring, patching, and imply the installing of a COTS solution, e.g., the Host Based Security System (HBSS), are not only not implementable as is, but may also decrease security and system performance by offering greater adversary access.</p>
<p>Achievement of integrated warfare and kill chain effects while preventing that of the adversary is critical, so it is assumed that all R&amp;D efforts would be mission relatable with germane threat assumptions vice standalone concepts /solutions. It is not desired to employ layer upon layer of costly defenses that only prevent cyber resiliency, dynamic re-configurability / response or, essentially, cyberspace maneuverability.</p>

Note the Erie page has not yet been posted however, the main DyNet page is very informative.</p>
<p><strong> NOTICE!</strong> The Federal government is buying and Federal Prime contractors are looking for qualified subcontracting partners!  This year's main event will feature the US Navy's Office of Small  Business Programs as keynote to discussing the upcoming Shipbuilding Plan of the USN Fleet and its expansion. Also present will be the US Army Corps of Engineers, Buffalo District, which does much work within the Erie and Ontario lake shores as well as the Pittsburgh District which has multipurpose reservoirs and recreation areas within the northern portions of PA and OH.</p>
<p>Small Businesses interested in the federal market are encouraged to attend this FREE regional  event. Government agencies and prime contractors in a wide range of NAICS from the Tri-State area of Western Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio will be there to find qualified small businesses to help them meet federally mandated goals.  While this is a tri-state event, all small AND LARGE contractors are invited to participate.  Past attendees came from 10 states - truly a Regional event.</p>
<p>Dynamic Networking for Small Business (DyNet)will give the Tri-State's small businesses the networking opportunities to match their capabilities with multiple federal agencies and prime contractors all at one convenient location and in one day.

<p>Large business prime contractors will be on hand to help mentor and partner with their small business brethren and this networking event is what it is all about.  This is not structured matchmaking; it is a high-energy networking day without agendas, guest speakers, and a lot of other fluff.  Creating a venue where networking is the main event brings everyone to the table - it is amazing what can get done over a cup of coffee.  Small Business attendees are encouraged to maximize their time networking as well as take advantage of the learning opportunities offered.</p>
<p>PLUS, organizations that support small businesses in the federal market will also be on hand to share their expertise.</p>

<SUBJECT>Procure a Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (PCVD) System

<RESPDATE>072318

<DESC>Notice of Intent for Sole Source Award - Procure a Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (PCVD) System equipment components required for life cycle replacement and risk mitigation spares for existing PCVD System 1 and PCVD System 2 located at the Fleet Readiness Center Southeast facilities, Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida
<p><br />SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District intends to award a sole source contract to Oerlikon Metco (US) Inc. 1101 Prospect Ave Westbury, NY, 11590-2724</p>
<p>2. Description of Supply</p>
<p>Items to procure include Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (PCVD) System equipment components required for life cycle replacement and risk mitigation spares for existing PCVD System 1 (Booths 2 &amp; 3) and PCVD System 2 (Booths 6 &amp; 7) located at the Fleet Readiness Center Southeast facilities, Naval Air Station Jacksonville. Each of these systems consists of two environmentally isolated booths. One booth contains the PCVD spray/air venting equipment and the second booth protects the operators and contains power supplies, controls, etc. necessary to operate the PCVD processes. These PCVD systems were initially installed in the FRCSE shop facilities and connected to the various existing facility services to include the facility wide air pollutant exhaust handling unit as complete systems.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 332117 -- Powder Metallurgy Part Manufacturing</p>
<p>3. Authority</p>
<p>DFARS 206.302-1, Only One Responsible Source</p>
<p>4. Reason for Sole Source <br /><br />(a) Background: The installation of Sulzer Metco components is essential to meet the Government's requirements in order for the project to result in complete and operationally integrated PCVD systems located in Building 794. These systems are required to apply mission critical coatings to military aircraft parts. This action requires the specification of brand name equipment (Sulzer Metco). If life cycle replacement / risk mitigation spare equipment components from another manufacturer were to be utilized in PCVD Systems 1 &amp; 2, extensive replacement of existing system components that are in good working order would be required in order to maintain overall systems operability. This would result in an excessive duplication of cost to the Government due to the replacement of components that are in good working order so that components from another manufacturer could be used.<br />(b) Justification: The scope of the proposed supply action is to lifecycle replace and install risk mitigation spare equipment components for portions of existing systems 1 &amp; 2. If new components from another brand of products with similar functions were introduced, much, if not all, of the existing viable system components would have to be replaced due to non-compatibility. In addition, modifying components of another brand to ensure compatibility with the existing systems would require major unnecessary costs to research the feasibility of mixing parts from different manufacturers as typically manufacturers use proprietary architecture, software, etc. In the event that research determines feasibility exists, additional costs would be incurred to integrate the off-brand components into the existing infrastructure. Lastly, attempting modification and integration of off-brand components would void warranties on the new equipment and lead to unnecessary future repair costs as there would be no warranty to cover repairs. The Government would lose the benefit of having a manufacturer's warranty.</p>
<p>5. No solicitation package will be issued.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 PM Eastern Time on July 23, 2018. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to jesse.lugo@usace.army.mil. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<CONTACT>William T. Brannen, Phone 7704882084, Email vwl0@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Allentown for primate caging. The Allentown PG09B12F5E-0041 nonhuman primate cage provides instant compatibility with a large part of our current useable caging inventory. The side panel constructs are full thickness stainless steel that is not available in other caging modalities. The side access arrangement allows for the connection to our existing platforms without the added expenditure for adaptive panels. Through current usage, it has been demonstrated that the unique ratchet bar assembly with a full complement of seven locking positions is safer for extended operation. The front door assembly requires fewer applications of secondary locks to secure the safety of the operator and decrease the damage done by innovative nonhuman primates. Other caging products are incompatible with the docking mechanisms on our current preferred caging in excess of 9.0 sq. ft. footprint. These increase the risk of possible animal exposure during routine procedures. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within ten (10) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to William Brannen at VWL0@cdc.gov by 10:00 A.M. EST, July 16, 2018.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.

This solicitation 36C25018Q9419 and is issued as a request for quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-99, effective June 15, 2018. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. Offerors must state their business size when submitting their offer.
 
Salient Characteristics
The Chalmers P. Wylie VA ACC is in of replacing the ScriptPro data terminals and miscellaneous accessories.  Additionally, the pharmacy will be adding a Compact Robotic Prescription Dispensing System that will be utilized in the Vault.  The upgrade to the system must be compatible with the current ScriptPro system as it has been used at the Columbus VA since 2001 and we will continue to operate with components from the current system. 
The procurement includes the following:
The following are replacements and upgrades for end of the life:
SP Central Expanded Platform
Pharmacy Data Terminal
Pharmacy Printer
Electronic Signature Pad
SP Dual Serial Interface Controller
The following are new additions:
Compact Robotic Prescription Dispensing System   a new compact robot that will be utilized in the Vault to improve safety, accuracy and efficiency
Eyecon Model 9420   a new automated counting tray that will count the number of tablets/capsules by simply pouring the tablets/capsules on the counting tray.  Additionally, it will capture an image for later reference if a patient claims they were shorted on a prescription fill.  This Eyecon counting tray is an item ScriptPro has developed to connect with their server to save the image.  No other company offers this item to work with the ScriptPro system.
Smart Card Scanner   recommended by ScriptPro per a memo from the VA regarding the addition of these to any upgrades.  However, due to the ScriptPro system already requiring a log-in, we advise not purchasing these due to the intent already being met and the inefficiencies these would add into the system.
Robotic Cell Multiplexor for SP200 Robot & Conversion to Robot to Accept RCMs   new cells to go into the existing robot that count independent of the robot.  These are great for high volume medications as the counting will already be done and when the arm arrives at the cell it will dump the tablets/capsules into the bottle versus the traditional cells which count once the arm arrives. This RCM is an item ScriptPro has developed to work in their robot.  No other company offers this item to work with the ScriptPro system.
Standard Interface (EyeCon, Rx Paperwork and MedGuides)   required interface with the upgrades mentioned in this section.
Conversion to Collating Control Center   this allows for six lanes coming off the existing robot versus the one lane currently.  This will improve efficiency of the robot.
Conversion of SP200 to Bulk Load Vial Dispenser   this allows for the existing robot to be filled by dumping in the bottles versus placing them in one by one currently.  Additionally, it will cut the number of replacements of the vials per day from approximately 8 to 2.

New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "GRAY MARKET" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. No telephone requests for information will be accepted.  Only emailed requests received directly from the Offeror are acceptable.  It is the Offeror s responsibility to ensure the quote is received.

Quote must be good for 90 calendar days after close of this Combined Synopsis Solicitation. 

This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines. Registration information can be found at www.sam.gov.

Security Requirements 
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. 
A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 
All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 
The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination. 
Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). 
Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records 

Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract. 
The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 
If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 
If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. 
The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated. 
Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response. 
Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above-mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response. 
The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. 
To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant 
With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 
In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.






 
Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 
The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

<DESC>Recording Preservation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-474); the legislation was reauthorized in 2016 (PL114-217). The U.S. Congress created the National Film Preservation Board through the National Film Preservation Act of 1988 (PL100-446); Congress most recently reauthorized the National Film Preservation Board in 2016 (PL114-217). As part of Public Law 114-217, the United States Congress has mandated that the Library of Congress (Library): 1) "implement a comprehensive national recording preservation program" and 2) "carry out the comprehensive national film preservation program for motion pictures established under the National Film Preservation Act" and "review the comprehensive national film preservation plan, and amend it to the extent necessary."
<p>Funding for these tasks is being provided by National Recording Preservation Board and National Film Preservation Board. The resulting contract shall fulfill the above Congressional mandates by implementing selected recommendations found in the National Recorded Sound Preservation Plan and the National Film Preservation Plan.</p>
<p>The National Recorded Sound Preservation Plan published in February 2013 contains 32 recommendations (comprised of 84 separate action items) to implement, many of which are lengthy, time-consuming projects. The National Film Preservation Plan was published in 1994 and while much of that publication remains timely, portions need updating in response to technological and other changes since then. Additional related studies published by the Library--such as the December 2013 Survival of American Silent Feature Films: 1912-29--added additional recommendations and action items.</p>
<p>These Congressionally-mandated efforts far exceed the capacity of Library staff. The resulting contract will enable a contractor to perform the work promptly and effectively in order to fulfill the two Congressional mandates: to implement the National Recording Preservation Plan and to continue implementation and updates to the National Film Preservation Plan, as required. The resulting contract will also greatly assist the mission of the Library's Packard Campus to preserve our recorded sound and moving image heritage for future generations. <br /><br />The resulting contract shall support six separate tasks: 1) National Recording Registry Radio Programs, 2) Traveling Archivists/Experts Program, 3) Report on Fostering Increased Diversity in the Audio-Visual Preservation Community, (4) Digital Restoration of the National Film Registry title, "Jazz on a Summer's Day, " 5) Enhancements to the Discography of American Historical Recordings, and 6) Photochemical Conservation of the National Film Registry title, "Memento".</p>
<p>The resulting contract will assist the mission of the Library's National Film and Recording Preservation Boards to preserve our recording sound and film/moving image heritage for future generations.</p>

<p>HHSAR 352.222-70 Contractor Cooperation in Equal Employment Opportunity Investigations (Dec 2015)</p>
<p>HHSAR 352.239-73 Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Notice (Dec 2015)</p>
<p>(a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194), require that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.</p>
<p>(b) Accordingly, any offeror responding to this solicitation must comply with established HHS EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. The complete text of the Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards.</p>
<p>(c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are stated in the clause at 352.239-74, Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT supplies meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must submit an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining whether proposed EIT supplies conform to applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows offerors or developers to self-evaluate their supplies and document-in detail-whether they conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard, and any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template are available under Section 508 policy on the HHS website http://www.hhs.gov/web/508.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the Government's determination whether proposed EIT services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must provide enough information to assist the Government in determining that the EIT services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards, including any underway remediation efforts addressing conformance issues.</p>
<p>(d) Respondents to this solicitation must identify any exception to Section 508 requirements. If a offeror claims its supplies or services meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and it is later determined by the Government, i.e., after award of a contract or order, that supplies or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.</p>
<p>HHSAR 352.239-74 Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility (Dec 2015)</p>
<p>(a) Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) supplies and services developed, acquired, or maintained under this contract or order must comply with the "Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) Accessibility Standards" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards.<br />(b) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this contract or order are identified in the Statement of Work or Specification or Performance Work Statement. The contractor must provide any necessary updates to the submitted HHS Product Assessment Template(s) at the end of each contract or order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (see FAR 2.101) when the contract or order duration is one year or less. If it is determined by the Government that EIT supplies and services provided by the Contractor do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the contract, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense.<br />(c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this contract are:<br />1194.21, 1194.22, 1194.23, 1194.24, 1194.31 and 1194.41 <br />(d) In the event of a modification(s) to this contract or order, which adds new EIT supplies or services or revises the type of, or specifications for, supplies or services, the Contracting Officer may require that the contractor submit a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template and any other additional information necessary to assist the Government in determining that the EIT supplies or services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards. Instructions for documenting accessibility via the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS website: (http://www.hhs.gov/web/508). If it is determined by the Government that EIT supplies and services provided by the Contractor do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the contract, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense.<br />(e) If this is an Indefinite Delivery contract, a Blanket Purchase Agreement or a Basic Ordering Agreement, the task/delivery order requests that include EIT supplies or services will define the specifications and accessibility standards for the order. In those cases, the Contractor may be required to provide a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template and any other additional information necessary to assist the Government in determining that the EIT supplies or services conform to Section 508 accessibility standards. Instructions for documenting accessibility via the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508. If it is determined by the Government that EIT supplies and services provided by the Contractor do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the provided documentation, remediation of the supplies or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense.

<DESC><p>The BETTER program aims to develop enhanced methods for personalized, multilingual semantic extraction and retrieval from text. The goal is to provide a user with a system that quickly and accurately extracts complex semantic information, targeted for a specific user, from text. The system then uses this extracted information to discover and triage relevant documents from a large corpus. Towards this end, BETTER will focus on three research areas: 1) information extraction, 2) information retrieval, and 3) human-in-the-loop interaction. BETTER will apply these three research areas across three phases composed of diverse problem areas and language sets. Throughout the duration of each phase increasingly fine-grained information needs will serve to focus the information extraction and retrieval elements, as well as providing a basis for human-in-the-loop interaction.</p>

Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Oct 2014) applies to this acquisition. <br />(a) The Government may award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;<br />(ii) price;<br />(iii) past performance, if applicable (see FAR 15.304)<br />Award shall be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror in LPTA solicitations.<br />To be considered a technically acceptable solution for a parts procurement, the quoted parts shall meet the solicitation requirements including required parts, delivery dates, and terms and conditions stated in the solicitation.

To be considered acceptable for past performance, a search of the PPIRS must reveal no negative past performance information for the recent and relevant records. In the event there are no recent and/or relevant PPIRS records, the quoter may submit information on recent and relevant subcontracts and/or commercial contracts.

In the context of acceptable or unacceptable, "unknown" past performance shall be considered "acceptable." To be considered recent, the effort must either still be in progress or have been completed within the previous three (3) years from date of this draft award notice. To be considered relevant the record should be similar in terms of complexity, scope, and magnitude. "Scope" is defined as experience in areas defined in the SOW. "Magnitude" is defined as the measure of similarity of the volume, dollar value, and/or duration of work actually performed under the quoter's submitted contracts to the SOW. At the quoter's discretion, additional past performance information may be submitted with the quote as a supplement to PPIRS. If furnished, this submission will be evaluated in accordance with the procedures described above. <br />The Government will evaluate quoted pricing for reasonableness utilizing techniques described in FAR 13.106-3. <br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror by the Government within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />10.

Pallet markings shall be applied to the stringer or block on diagonally opposite sides and ends of the pallet and be contrasting and clearly visible. All dunnage used in configuring and/or securing the load shall also comply with ISPM 15 and be marked with an ALSC approved "DUNNAGE" stamp. Failure to comply with the requirements of this restriction may result in refusal, destruction, or treatment of materials at the point of entry.<br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.<br />The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.<br />When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank." <br />In some situations, the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s). <br />If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.<br />The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.<br />Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system. <br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS<br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions. <br />Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance.

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. <br />Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico (replaces RapidGate). Vendor is responsible to acquire DBIDS credentials prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at https://www.cnic.navy.mil/om/dbids.html. DBIDS credentials require (in succession) (1) Present a letter or official document from the Government sponsoring organization that provides the purpose for your access, (2) Present valid identification, such as a passport or Real ID Act-compliant state driver's license, (3) Present a completed copy of the SECNAV 5512/1 form to obtain your background check, (4) Upon completion of the background check, the Visitor Control Center representative will complete the DBIDS enrollment process, which includes your photo, finger prints, base restrictions, and several other assessments, and (5) After all of this is done, the contractor will be provided with the DBDIS credential. For vendors with existing Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS) cards, see https://www.cnic.navy.mil/om/dbids.html for instructions to obtain DBIDS credentials. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held DBIDS credentials are active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with DBIDS.<br />Additional access permissions may be required in the future.<br />Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities.

The Administrator of the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division (the Administrator) will publish annual determinations in the Federal Register no later than 90 days before the effective date of the new E.O. minimum wage rate. The Administrator will also publish the applicable E.O. minimum wage on www.wdol.gov (or any successor Web site) and on all wage determinations issued under the Service Contract Labor Standards statute or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute. The applicable published E.O. minimum wage is incorporated by reference into this contract.
(i) The Contractor may request a price adjustment only after the effective date of the new annual E.O. minimum wage determination.

(ii) Individuals exempted from the minimum wage requirements of the FLSA under 29 U.S.C. 213(a) and 214(a) and (b), unless otherwise covered by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute. These individuals include but are not limited to--

(h) Disputes. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR 10.51,Disputes concerning contractor compliance, the procedures for resolving disputes concerning a contractor's compliance with Department of Labor regulations at 29 CFR part 10. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. These disputes include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the Department of Labor, or the workers or their representatives.
(i) Antiretaliation. The Contractor shall not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any worker because such worker has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to compliance with the E.O. or this clause, or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding.

(d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.

(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.

(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS<br /> <br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-98, dated May 1, 2018.
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 333242 - Semiconductor Machinery Manufacturing with a small business size standard of 1500 employees.   THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING COMPETED UNDER SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.</p>
<p>The Heat Transfer and Alternative Energy Systems (HTAES) Group within the Energy and Environment Division contributes to the advancement of measurement science needed to achieve net-zero energy, high-performance buildings.  One key component to achieving net-zero energy is advanced building energy technologies, especially renewable energy sources.  Accordingly, the focus area for the HTAES Group is to improve the tools used for measuring and evaluating renewable solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies. The PV project within the group is also involved in evaluating the performance of PV cells and modules after field exposure to the outdoor elements, or when the cells are aged in an accelerated laboratory setting within the Engineering Laboratory.</p>
<p>The main objective for the acquisition of this instrument is that wire bonding capability is needed for fabrication of a standard reference device that is currently under works in our laboratory. Specifically, the wire bonder will be used to electrically bond various photovoltaic cells to contact pads. Also, some other semiconductor devices such as light emitting diodes will be wire bonded to various contacts using this requested instrument for the purpose of developing new measurement methods.</p>
<p>A wire bonder applies a burst of ultrasonic energy to bond wires between electrical contact pads and interconnect semiconductor chips and other electronic devices. There are generally two types of bonding that can be done with this tool: ball bonding and wedge bonding. They both have various advantages and disadvantages and will be required for the work envisioned in our laboratory.</p>
<p>Minimum Specifications</p>
<p>The offered product shall meet all the following requirements:</p>
<p>1.	The requested instrument shall be a manual wire bonder and no motorized XYZ travel is required. <br />2.	The requested product shall offer both a wedge bonding and ball bonding capability within one tool, with ability to perform both wedge-wedge and ball-wedge bonding when needed with minimal adjustments. <br />3.	The instrument shall accommodate wire bonding between electronic packages and contacts with both gold wires and aluminum wires, depending on the end user's needs. <br />4.	The ultrasonic system of the instrument shall have a phase locked loop (PLL) control with a transducer frequency of 63 KHz or equivalent and an ultrasonic power of 6 W or more. <br />5.	The wire clamping mechanism of the instrument shall provide the ability for the wire to feed up or down with motorized movement preferred. <br />6.	The instrument shall provide a bond force of at least 100 g. <br />7.	The instrument shall allow for both wire and ribbon bonding, with wedge wire diameters of up to 70 microns or more and a ribbon diameter of at least 200 microns. <br />8.	The instrument shall offer storage of bond parameters such as bond time and force. <br />9.	The contractor shall provide a microscope that seamlessly integrates with the wire bonder and provides an appropriate level of magnification for the smallest of bonds. The said microscope shall also be equipped with an illuminator. <br />10.	The contractor shall provide an adjustable height heater stage with a minimum stage diameter of 50 mm and heating capability to a temperature of at least 200 degrees C. The said stage must have both mechanical clamping and vacuum connection for holding samples. <br />11.	The electrical power requirements shall allow for use of the instrument with electrical outlets that provide 120 V/60 Hz up to 10 A. <br />12.	The contractor shall provide a bond starter kit that shall include at least 100 m of both gold and aluminum wires, appropriate wedge tools for both types of wires, probe needles or tungsten wires for unplugging purposes, tweezers, bond sample substrates and any other necessary tool needed for first time use of the instrument. <br />13.	The contractor shall offer a 1-day installation and training within 60 days of the delivery date of the instrument.</p>

<p>Selection of an Offeror for award will be based on an evaluation of quotes against three factors. The factors, in order of importance are: technical approach, personnel requirements and organizational experience, and price. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost/price. The process described in FAR 15.101-1 may be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors to consider award to other than the lowest price offer or other than the highest technically rated factor. The Government intends to make an award to the Offeror whose quotes provide the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs set forth in the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. The merits of each quote will be evaluated carefully. Each quote must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.</p>

<DESC><strong>Title:  Transmission Electron Microscope for NINDS </strong>
<p><strong> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items</strong> prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p><strong> The solicitation number is NIH-NIDA-CSS-18-4959231 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). </strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p><strong> The associated NAICS code is 334516</strong>, "Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing" and the small business size standard is 1,000 or fewer employees.</p>
<p><strong>This acquisition is unrestricted, with no small business restrictions.  Both large and small business offers shall be considered for award.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contract Type</strong></p>
<p>A firm-fixed price type contract is contemplated for this requirement.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>Statement of Need and Purpose: </strong><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to procure one (1) transmission electron microscope for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Electron Microscopy Facility (EMF).</p>
<p><strong>Background Information and Objective: </strong><br />The EMF at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) provides technical support to intramural researchers in conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders.  The intramural scientists seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological diseases. A major part of the research activities within the EMF critically depends on transmission electron microscopy, especially emerging capabilities in precision mapping positions of objects (rendering possibilities of correlative LM and EM studies), ease of stitching for making montages, tilting for stereo viewing, and tracing serial sections for 3D reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>Generic Name of Product: </strong><br />Transmission Electron microscope</p>
<p><strong><br />Quantity:</strong><br />One (1) transmission electron microscope is required.  Installation and on-site training are also required.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Contract Type:</strong><br />A firm-fixed price type contract is anticipated for this acquisition consistent with commercial practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Salient characteristics </span></strong><br />The NINDS EMF requires one (1) transmission electron microscope that meets the following specifications:</p>
<p>1.	The GUI integrated to manage processing must be Windows 10-based and capable of displaying TEM conditions, operation windows, digital camera (where appropriate) and STEM/EDS data.  User logon must include a lock-out mechanism using expertise levels ranging from beginners to administrators as well as personalized work environments including assignment of multifunctional knobs/buttons on the knob sets. A touchscreen must be part of the standard configuration.</p>
<p><br />2.	Must provide computer training in the form of a set of tutorials and user guides.   They must be designed to help beginners familiarize themselves with microscope operation and assist experienced users to explore advanced functions.  Tutorial videos combined with the function-oriented GUI to assist microscopists at all levels of expertise is a desired feature.</p>
<p><br />3.	The specimen rod must have a double o-ring to prevent vacuum leaks through the goniometer. When inserted, the volume between these o-rings is continuously pumped, creating an tight differentially pumped airlock system which will allow the microscope to return to 10-5 Pascal operating vacuum range withing 15 sec of inserting the specimen rod.</p>
<p><br />4.	The microscope must come with a viewing chamber that support the use of binoculars and fluorescent viewing screens.</p>
<p><br />5.	The microscope must have exchangeable polepieces.  It must enable lab staff to change polepieces easily with no major realignments required following exchange.  High contrast, high resolution and STEM polepieces need to be completely exchangeable to address the needs of a multi-user facility.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />6.	The microscope must have a cantilever-style, micro-active goniometer with motor driven 5-axis control.  The specimen holding system must be tension free and employed for this cantilever-style goniometer for excellent mechanical stability.  Stage translation shall be by trackball or mouse.  The goniometer must automatically return to stored positions when these positions are selected by the operator.  Prior to specimen exchange all five axes must be automatically brought to zero in a single operation.  This goniometer is essential for automated operation such as tomography and digital montaging.</p>
<p><br />7.	A quick-change specimen holder must be standard requiring only a tweezer to exchange samples.  the specimen rod must accommodate multiple tips for special applications such as tomography and preserving calibration grids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />8.	A four-specimen holder must be included.  The holder must allow at least four specimens into the column with one insertion of the holder for rapid comparison of grids.</p>
<p><br />9.	The goniometer must tilt up +/-80 degrees to acquire the most complete tomography datasets. No special goniometer should be required for tomography. Dual axis solution must be possible using special-purpose holders.</p>
<p><br />10.	The microscope must have an image orientation system (IOS), which rotates the image +/- 90 degrees in increments of 15 degrees using the imaging lenses (i.e.. independent of a tilt/rotate holder). Thus the best image orientation can be achieved without removing the holder and manipulating the grid. When rotating the image, the stage movement directions must compensate so that the image continues to move along the same original directions. The image size must remain constant when the IOS is operated.</p>
<p><br />11.	The microscope should allow for simple selections of modes such as LOWMAG, MAG and SADIFF using simple switches on the GUI or on the knobsets. Mode switching should not require re-alignment of the column.</p>
<p><br />12.	When changing the high tension the alignment must be automatically recalled at key voltages, i.e. 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 kV and a voltage as low as 10kV must be possible.</p>
<p><br />13.	A Minimum Dose System (MDS) must be present. It should consist of three independent modes, Search, Focus and Photo.  In both the focus and search modes it is possible to observe features surrounding the area of interest with minimal perturbation of the area that will actually be photographed under minimum dose conditions. Optionally, software must be available which supports a graphical mode of setting off-axis conditions and also allows for user-specified lens values.</p>
<p><br />14.	For cryo-EM an anti-contaminator and cryo-shield must be present that achieves an ice contamination rate of no more than 0.5 nm/hr measured from low-dose images of tilted latex beads without significant limiting the field of view. For optimal protection the cryo-shield must completely surround the specimen.</p>
<p><br />15.	The system must be equipped with AMT-BioSprint29L-ActiveVu camera or equivalent.</p>
<p><br />16.	Microscope system should have the ability to interface in GUI with a Matataki Flash camera or equivalent (a sCMOS based camera with 2k x 2k 6.5-&micro;m pixels operating at 30 fps).  The aforementioned camera is NOT part of this acquisition; please do NOT included pricing for a Matataki Flash or equivalent camera.  The only requirement for this acquisition is that the microscope system have the ability to fully interface with such a camera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;   <br />17.	The vacuum system must be diffusion pump-based.</p>
<p><br />18.	This system must  be compatible with software automation packages available such as JADAS, the JEOL Automated Data Acquisition Software, LLP and Picture Overlay. JADAS is a package designed for Single Particle Acquisition (SPA). LLP is Limitless Panorama that offers stage-based montaging to cover the entire grid. Picture Overlay is a software utility that allows for the overlay of a digital image acquired from an optical microscope in CLEM workflows thereby combining the spatio-temporal information from a fluorescence microscope with high-resolution structural data from a TEM. Alternatively, freely available academic-based software such as SerialEM (UC Boulder) and Leginon (NYSBC) must be available. Both these software packages acquire large quantities of high quality data without operator intervention from frozen-hydrated specimens for SPA. Additionally, tomography, montaging and picture overlay are also supported by SerialEM. This software package fully automatically acquires high-quality tilt series at user-specified locations. All software packages geared towards SPA must be capable to acquire high resolution images at user-specified points of interest that are visited using stage movement while maintaining eucentricity, focus and drift below user-specified thresholds.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />19.	The microscope must be capable of achieving a minimum magnification of 10x and a maximum magnification of 1,200,000x. The minimum magnification in MAG mode must be 200x, thus providing for a large field-of-view without having to switch into LOWMAG mode.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Warranty Requirements:</strong><br />The Contractor shall provide a one (1) year warranty on all equipment, parts and repairs.  All products shall be warranted to be free from material defects in workmanship or material under normal use and service for warranty period.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Term Options for Extented Warranty Coverage:</span><br />Four successive one-year Term Options for extended warranty coverage on all TEM equipment, parts and repairs are anticipated to be made part of the subject contract.  Each successive one-year Term Option for extended warranty coverage will be firm fixed price.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Term Option Pricing Schedule:</p>
<p><br />Term Option 1 (12-month extended warranty coverage commencing upon expiration of standard one-year warranty period): $______________</p>
<p><br />Term Option 2 (12-month extended warranty coverage commencing upon expiration of Term Option 1 warranty period): $________________</p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION  <br />PURCHASE OF HALLPRINT STAINLESS STEEL FISH TAGS AND APPLICATORS FOR THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE (NMFS)
<p>(I)	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II)	This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NFFR7400-18-03239.</p>
<p>(III)	The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-99(Deviation 2017-02).</p>
<p>(IV)	This solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition. The associated NAICS code is 334419.  The small business size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>(V)	This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial services and products:</p>
<p>NOAA's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center in Honoloulu, HI has a requirement for additional Hallprint fish tags and applicators. These products are used in conjunction with existing Hallprint equipment to assist fisherman in an ongoing mark and recapture study related to interaction rates and demographics of sharks around Hawaii.</p>
<p><br />(VI)	Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>**This is a brand name requirement. No other brand will be considered**</p>
<p>Brand Name Justification: Our research program has been using these ID tags for over 25 years, they have proven retention times and are required for continuity and consistency of our mark recapture efforts. The Hallprint tags' swivel and applicator minimize irritation to the animal's skin/flesh and maximize tag retention. These efficiencies are specific to Hallprint and not found with any other manufacturers.</p>
<p>In addition, consistency and continuity are important because fishermen that we are already working with for these projects and will be handing more tags to in the future will be using the same tag applicator poles that are meant to be used with hallprint tags for the purpose of tagging sharks. No other tags are compatible with these poles.</p>
<p><br />CLIN 0001: SSD stainless steel dart head tag - wire through marker, 170 mm in length (QTY 2000)<br />CLIN 0002: SSD applicators (QTY 200)</p>
<p>(VII)	Delivery required by 08/31/2018.</p>

<p>NOAA ACQUISITION MANUAL (NAM) - 1330-52-.242-304 NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.<br />3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).<br />2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.<br />7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The National Shipbuilding Research Program Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP ASE) is interested in receiving summary proposals for the research effort described below. The NSRP ASE program goal is to reduce the cost of building and maintaining U.S. Navy ships. To accomplish this, NSRP ASE is focused on industry-wide implementation of solutions to common cost drivers - these solutions include leveraging of best commercial practices, use of new technologies and creation of industry-specific initiatives. Successful projects are generally those that incorporate aggressive technology transfer and implementation by multiple U.S. shipyards. Projects should demonstrate value through articulation of anticipated return-on investment and clearly reduce total ownership costs with benefits that can be delivered by varied combinations of reductions in acquisition and Fleet lifecycle costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Research Announcement (RA) is posted on the NSRP website. It will be modified as necessary to reflect changes in government and/or industry priorities. Potential proposers are reminded that there are several requirements incorporated in NSRP Research Announcements that merit particular attention, particularly the need for a strong business case that can and will be supported by project metrics. Readers are strongly urged to review further details provided in this announcement and the NSRP Proposal Preparation Kit.</span></p>

The second option period will have a period of performance of eight months. The period of performance start date for the base period will commence on the day of contract award. Actual dates will be indicated in the contract award.<br /><br />(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the provision. <br /><br />(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items does not apply to the solicitation. The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:<br /><br />Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:
<p>1) Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:</p>
<p>&bull; Quotes that are not received timely<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to submit any required documentation <br />&bull; Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation</p>
<p>2) Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.</p>
<p>3) The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 3 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.</p>
<p>If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue (in order by price) until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.</p>
<p>4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.</p>
<p>(e) Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1. Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptable - The quoted range meets all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The quoted range does not meet all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2. Past Performance</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)</p>
<p>Unacceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br /><br />Note: In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Note: Quoters are not required or requested to submit past performance references. The Government will use public and Government-restricted sources (e.g. PPIRS) to evaluate past performance.</p>
<p><br />Factor 3. Price</p>
<p>Price will not be rated. Price analysis will be conducted to determine reasonableness.</p>
<p>(x) Quoters are required to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items with its quote. Quoters shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if they have completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov . If the Quoter has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, it shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (q) of this provision.<br /><br />(xii) The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

The <br />Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.</p>
<p>(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following re-representation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the re-representation was completed:</p>

Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />(e) Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.<br /><br />(f) Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.<br /><br />(g) Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.<br /><br />(h) DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent <br />practicable, the Contractor shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that <br />information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.<br /><br />(i) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD--<br /><br />(1) To entities with missions that may be affected by such information;<br /><br />(2) To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, or mitigation of cyber incidents;<br /><br />(3) To Government entities that conduct counterintelligence or law enforcement investigations;<br /><br />(4) For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in the program at 32 CFR part 236); or<br /><br />(5) To a support services contractor (``recipient'') that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information.<br /><br />(j) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the Government's use and release of such information.<br /><br />(k) The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.<br /><br />(l) Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.<br /><br />(m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall--<br /><br />(1) Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial items, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The <br />Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and<br /><br />(2) Require subcontractors to--<br /><br />(i) Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and<br /><br />(ii) Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a)<em> Definition. </em>"Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e)</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) terminate the contract for default.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</span></p>

<p>(a) This is a competitive best value acquisition in which the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, considering price and other factors. The Government intends to make award to the offeror with the best value to the Government. The following are evaluation factors that shall be used in the evaluation process:</p>
<p>Price- The Government will review pricing for reasonableness, balancing and realism. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the low offer and may award without conducting discussions.</p>

A past performance information form (PPIF) will be provided with the solicitation as Attachment III. The offeror will send the form to a maximum of five references of their choosing. The PPIF will only be accepted from the third party reference and not the offeror themselves.

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(c) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The Option to Extend Services Clause 52.217-8 will also be evaluated for the offeror's proposed prices. The 52.217-8 extension of services will be added/calculated into the offeror's price proposal by utilizing the final option year price. Unit prices would remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Other Acquisition Notes:</p>
<p>1. The hardcopy/electronic (e-mail) submission is considered the official offer. If there are any discrepancies between submitted offers and the original offer, submitted version will take precedence.</p>
<p>2. It is the Government's intention to award without discussions, however the Government retains the right to conduct discussion, if needed. Offerors are encouraged to present their best technical offer and prices in their initial offer submission. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>3. If an offeror believes that the requirements in these instructions contain an error, an ambiguity, omission, or are otherwise deemed unsound, the offeror shall immediately notify the KO in writing with supporting rationale. The offeror is reminded that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial offer, as received, without clarifications.</p>
<p>4. The items being solicited by this action are "Brand Name only." Only those offerors able to provide the exact brand name items solicited in Section B (Attachment # 1) of this request for quote, and that are able to offer the warranties of the items' original manufacturer will be considered for award. A redacted Limited Competition Determination--Brand Name Only has been uploaded as Attachment # 4.</p>
<p>5. Selection of an offeror for contract award will be made on the basis of an assessment of each offeror's response to the combined synopsis/solicitation notice. As a combined synopsis/solicitation notice based on Lowest Price, selection of the awardee will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price among offerors technically capable of satisfying the Government's requirement, and that meet the responsibly criteria of FAR 9.104-1.</p>
<p>6. DLA Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) quotations are no acceptable for this combined synopsis/solicitation notice. Offeror's must complete the entire combined synopsis/solicitation notice including amendments previous posted in http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Quotes must be submitted on hard copy of this combined synopsis/solicitation notice and scanned and emailed to eric.heil@dla.mil and ricardo.blancosoto@dla.mil before the closing date of the notice.</p>
<p>7. Contractor must be registered in "System for Award Management" (SAM) before quote submission. Check the following SAM website link for registration and/or SAM expiration date, www.sam.gov. Submit SAM's certification with your quote. Quotes and SAM's certification dates must match.</p>
<p>8. COMPLETE PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS<br />Contractors shall provide their quote in the following manner, using zip file:<br />a.

<p>10. Quotes will be received by electronic commerce methods (e-mail) "only". The acquisition specialist shall authorize receipt of e-mailed quotes only on those notices where there is a reasonable expectation the quote will not exceed the maximum size limit of 15 MB, therefore it is inappropriate to authorize e-mailed quotes for very large and/or complex notice. If the size and/or complexity of the initial quote submission makes it impractical for the initial quote to be e-mailed, the acquisition specialist may authorize use of e-mail only for modifications and revisions to quote. Contact Eric Heil, 614-692-8634, to receive a verbal confirmation that the quote was successfully received.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10.

<DESC><p>The Better Extraction from Text Towards Enhanced Retrieval (BETTER) Program will develop methods for extracting increasingly fine-grained semantic information, with a focus of events in the form of who-did-what-to-whom-when-where, across multiple languages and problem domains. This extracted information will be applied to an information retrieval task. An additional area of focus is human-in-the-loop computation. Performer systems will need the ability to incorporate human judgments for metrics such as relevancy and accuracy of extracted or retrieved information.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 70Z03818QJ0000222 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-99, effective 15 June 2018.
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,250. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded on a competitive basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following parts:</p>
<p>Item Name: Cylinder Actua Line<br />Part Number: 70250-12065-043<br />National Stock Number: 1650-01-HS1-0676<br />Quantity: 9 Each<br />Manufacturer Cage Code: 78286<br />Required Delivery: 20-Dec-2018</p>
<p>At the time of award, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) will place an order for the purchase of nine (9) each. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.217-6, the USCG may require additional components up to a maximum quantity of eighteen (18) at the same price as the original order for three hundred and sixty-five (365) days after date of award. If any additional quantities are to be ordered the contractor will be notified through the issuance of a written modification. Delivery terms for each additional order will be included on the modification.</p>
<p>Only the items requested in this solicitation will be considered for award. All parts shall have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Cage Code 78286). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems. Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) aircraft.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance (COC) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to the manufacturer, manufacturer's COC and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on USCG aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor.</p>
<p>All parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>***Amendment 0001***<br /><br />The "Distributed Mission Command and Cloud Applications at the Tactical Edge" Technical Exchange Meeting&nbsp;is postponed until further notice.&nbsp;<br /><br /> This notice will be amended with updated information once it is available.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Solicitation Number: W909MY-18-R-TEM2<br />Network Cross Functional Team Technical Exchange Meeting<br />Topic: "Distributed Mission Command and Cloud Applications at the Tactical Edge"
<p>Notice Type: <br />Special Notice</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />Announcement.</p>
The U.S. Army will hold a tactical network related Technical Exchange Meeting on 8 May 2018 in Seattle, Wa. The goal of the event is to assist traditional industry partners, non-traditional industry partners, and academia in identifying and aligning their research efforts with Army tactical network modernization priorities as it relates to distributed mission command at the tactical edge. <br /><br />This events' focus is specific to enabling Army units to operate with elastic compute and storage in a disrupted, intermittent, and latent network environment. This event is meant for a technical audience to include software engineers, architecture experts, researchers, and integrators. The day will be spent discussing, in detail, the current challenge areas and potential utilization for dynamic allocation of mission command data and fostering discussion with industry and academia to assess these problems in the context of a modern network at the tactical edge. Representatives from Army program offices and the Network Cross Functional Team will be part of the technical exchange forum. Forum registration will close on 27 April 2018.<br /><br />The event will have multiple sessions covering different topical areas of interest with sign-in beginning at 0800 and the event ending not later than 1630.
<p><br />INDUSTRY TECHNICAL EXCHANGE MEETING BACKGROUND AND FOCUS <br />The Defense Innovation Board, Army Senior Leaders, and stakeholders all recognize the potential for cloud to enable AIrtificial Intelligence (AI), high data computing, and reduce Size Weight and Power (SWAP) considerations for tactical operations. The Network Cross Functional Team with Army partners will host a distributed mission command/cloud computing technical exchange meeting as a means of exploring the art of the possible to meet Army network needs.</p>
<p>The intent of the session&nbsp;is to enhance our Government-and-industry communication and enable industry to respond quicker to critical emerging requirements with innovative technology solutions and partnerships. This event will serve as a collaborative session for industry Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and Government SMEs to delve&nbsp;into the challenges, future potential, and solutions to provide distributed computing at the tactical edge.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS<br />The Government hopes to use information and insights gathered in the event to answer and inform&nbsp;the following questions and conderations:<br /><br />1. Given a DIL environment, how can we more efficiently employ elastic compute and storage at the tactical edge?<br /><br />2. What are the current solutions to increase mobility and efficiently compute at the tactical edge, while reducing size, weight, and power?<br /><br />3. How do we best use cloud capabilities to improve user experience?<br /><br />4. What HCI strategies are available to best use cloud enabled analytics and multiple discrete data sources?<br /><br />5. How do we set conditions, given DIL, to build an elastic cloud architecture to improve decision making as the battlefield becomes increasingly instrumented (IoT)?<br /><br />6. How do we modernize our applications to exploit the advantages of cloud? Strategies for moving from discrete single platform applications move toward an elastic, scalable, resource sharing application environment.<br /><br />7. Strategies for real time protecting and preserving data, code integrity, and assured data voracity to support tactical decision making. <br /><br />8. How can cloud improve command post mobility and survivability?<br /><br />9. How could the Army employ cloud strategies to reduce total cost of ownership, improve affordability, and improve security?<br /><br />10. What cloud strategies could the Army insert in the present tactical architecture immediately?</p>
<p>INDUSTRY QUESTIONS<br />Industry questions will be permitted during the Technical Exchange Meeting; however, questions in regards to any portfolio system in current source selection will not be allowed. The Army will make every effort to answer all questions posed&nbsp;during the forum. Additionally, you may submit topical questions prior to the&nbsp;event as part of the registration RSVP form. There is an area on the form for you to submit questions.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS<br />In order to obtain maximum participation from industry, vendors are limited to 3 personnel per company or major subsidiary. It is not required to have participated in a previous Industry Day/Forum or be a current Army vendor in order to register for this event. Registration for the&nbsp;event must be submitted by not later than 1300 ET on 27 April 2018 via email to CPT Adam Grines at adam.c.grines.mil@mail.mil with a carbon copy to Ms. Shahaadah Nalls at shahaadah.c.nalls.civ@mail.mil. Instructions are contained in Attachment 0001.<br /><br />A confirmation email with a complete final agenda for the Exchange Meeting, location and parking instructions will be provided after the registration process is completed, no later than Monday, 30 April 2018. Attendance at the event will be on a first come first serve basis, with a waiting list available in the event of cancellations. <br /><br />This event is not a marketing or tradeshow, it is a unique opportunity for your engineers to interact with Government experts in a collaborative environment. This is a closed media event. Maximum emphasis will be placed on an open discussion and collaboration with attendees and Government.</p>
<p>FINAL NOTE <br />The US Army will make every effort to hold the DISTRIBUTED MISSION COMMAND &amp; CLOUD APPLICATIONS AT THE TACTICAL EDGE TECHNICAL EXCHANGE MEETING at the times, dates and locations specified. The US Army holds the right to cancel and/or change session event times, dates and locations under certain conditions. These conditions usually include, but are not limited to: inclement weather, event venue cancellation or rescheduling, speaker cancellation or rescheduling, and insufficient number of participants for the event.

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR INVITATION FOR OFFERORS TO SUBMIT BIDS. THIS NOTICE WILL BE POSTED FOR A MINIMUM OF 15 DAYS PRIOR TO POSTING OF THE SOLICITATION.</strong>
<p><br />The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates issuance of solicitation 15B31418B00000001 for the award of a firm-fixed-price construction contract for a project entitled Repair Food Service Electric at the Federal Correctional Institution located at 501 Capital Circle NE, Tallahassee, Florida 32301. The anticipated performance period for the project will be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">208 calendar days</span></strong> from issuance of the notice to proceed. The work to be performed in association with this project includes the following scope:</p>
<p>The Food Service Building is an original construction that came on line in 1938. It currently has a 4160v switch gear in the Inside Powerhouse that feeds a 4160v transformer mounted on a pad outside of the Food Service Building. The bus duct from the transformer connects to a 1200 Amp breaker inside of the Food Service Basement. The bus duct had a catastrophic failure that resulted in a hole being blown out of the side of the bus duct. This resulted in the Food Service Building being without power. The 4160v transformer is currently being utilized by bypassing the bus duct with 500 MCM cable to provide power to the building. The switch gear, bus duct, transformer, and breakers are all obsolete. The intent of this project is to leave the buildings power fully operational and to tie into the 12470v High Voltage Switch by the Unicor Warehouse that has already been designated for the Food Service Building. The contractor shall install underground lines approximately 126.50 ft from vault EMH#1E to the new transformer location. The contractor shall run a new duct from a new 12470-120/208v pad mounted transformer. The new bus duct will run through the wall to the basement to feed a new 2000 amp main distribution panel replacing panel TAL-57-MDP. All other existing panels in the room and the panel located upstairs in the Recreation Center will be fed from the new MDP.&nbsp; Also, due to moisture in the location panels Tal-55-pan, Tal-56-pan, and Tal-57-pan in the basement will need to be replaced with Nema 3R enclosure(s).&nbsp; As part of the project. the contractor shall install one (1) new 2000 Amp breaker, one (1) new 1000 KVA transformer for our 12470 high voltage loop, replace and wire our main distribution panel, as well as three (3) other panels in the same room.&nbsp; The secondary side of the high voltage transformer would be 120/208V. Work includes, but is not limited to: design of the new fully-functional electrical system, breaker upgrades, replacement of the transformer, and new conduit and wiring.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 36.204, the estimated magnitude of the project lies between $500,000 and $1,000,000. (<em>NOTE: This range is one of 8 available ranges from FAR 36.204 and is not meant to imply that the project has necessarily been estimated/budgeted to the maximum of the selected range. It merely conveys that the estimate/budget lies somewhere within that range</em>). The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 238210 with a corresponding small business size standard of $15.0 million.&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is a 100% total small business set-aside.</span>&nbsp; </strong>All responsible small business sources are encouraged to submit a bid which will be considered for award. Faith-Based and Community-Based Organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. <br /><br /><strong>IMPORTANT: Any contractor interested in obtaining a contract award with the Federal Bureau of Prisons must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov.&nbsp; In order to qualify for award, your business size metrics information entered in your SAM registration must be less than or equal to the small business size standard specified above.&nbsp; Each bidder's SAM registration will be reviewed by the Government to confirm that your business size meets the small business size standard requirement.&nbsp; All bidders are urged to double check their SAM registration and update as necessary, including the size metrics information.</strong></p>
<p>The solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities web site <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>.&nbsp; Hard copies of the solicitation will not be made available.&nbsp; This site provides all downloading instructions to obtain a copy of the solicitation. The "Sensitive/Secure Package Upload" option will be selected for the procurement.

<div>FOR INFORMATION ONLY:</div>
This Pre-Solicitation Notice is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming. All questions regarding this Pre-Solicitation notice should be submitted in writing via email to Point of Contact(s) indicated below.<br />Construction Project:<br />U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Seattle District, requires the replacement of the Hiram M. Chittenden Lock's large lock Stoney Gate valve system. The work consists of:<br />1.	Gate Valve Replacement: The Stoney gate valve system consists of six gate valves that control the filling and emptying of the Lake Washington Ship Canal large lock chambers.  The valves are located in 14 feet tall by 8-1/2 feet wide culverts. The culverts and associated valves are accessible only when the large lock chambers are dewatered by the Government.   The scope encompasses demolition, removal, and replacement of the existing Stoney gate valves, valve guides, valve bases, machinery and incidentals related to work. This work is to be spread over four separate dewatering events.  <br />2.	Control Panel Replacement: The existing control panel is a partially programmable logic controller (PLC) based with additional hardwired controls and indicators. The PLC system primarily handles miter gate operation, and is vulnerable to disruption in the system (i.e. lightning strikes). The scope encompasses demolition, removal, and replacement of the Chittenden control panel, extension of fiber optic cabling, and incidentals related to work. The new system will utilize a master PLC and six Remote I/O Panels (RIOPS) each located in a miter gate machinery recess. RIOPS will provide localized control of the associated Stoney gate valve, and will additionally provide localized control of miter gate operations. The master/RIOP system will utilize a fiber optic ring network. Existing fiber optic cables will be incorporated into the new system and augmented with additional fiber optic cabling
<p>The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. The resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price.<br />Solicitation number W912DW18R0012 will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, www.fbo.gov, on or about 26 June 2018.

The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.  The small business size standard is $36,500,000 in average annual receipts. The solicitation is for full and open competition.<br />The solicitation documents for this requirement will be issued in electronic format only and will be made available online via the FBO website at www.fbo.gov under the subject solicitation number. NO CD's OR HARD COPIES WILL BE AVAILABLE. Offerors are responsible for checking for any update(s) to the Notice/Solicitation.

<DESC><p>06-JUL-2018, UPDATE TO PRESOLICITATION NOTICE: The purpose of this amendment to the pre-solicitation notice is to provide the vendor community with updated projections regarding solicitation release, proposal submission, and award.<br /><br />Project Title: Pharmaceutical Interventions for Noise-Induced Hearing Loss-Acute Exposure Treatment (PINIHL-AET)</p>
<p>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), in support of the United States Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) Tissue Injury and Regenerative Medicine Project Management Office (TIRM PMO), intends to solicit for research and development (R&amp;D) services to develop a pharmaceutical intervention for prevention of permanent noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) for acute exposure treatment within seventy-two (72) hours of exposure to unanticipated noise hazards common to military operations (e.g., blasts, forgotten ear plugs while on patrol).&nbsp; The desired status at the end of this procurement action is completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial and an approved Phase 3 clinical study plan, both under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application.</p>
<p>Hearing is a critical sense for Service Members (SMs).&nbsp; The inherently noise-hazardous environments common to military service make SMs particularly vulnerable to the vast subset of sensorineural hearing loss known as NIHL.&nbsp; Hearing injuries can threaten safety and fitness for duty by impeding communication, reducing situational awareness, hindering threat detection, and ultimately degrading mission effectiveness.&nbsp; In some cases, hearing loss may preclude redeployment or result in less optimal job assignment, and may permanently reduce their quality of life.</p>
<p>There are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacological prevention strategies for NIHL.&nbsp; Several non-pharmacological strategies are available but these cannot alone, nor in concert, fully eliminate hearing loss.&nbsp; Strategies employed by the Department of Defense (DoD) include: noise-control engineering, hearing protective devices (HPDs), and administrative controls to limit times of exposure.&nbsp; Current US Military protocols for post-exposure treatment of acute acoustic trauma (AAT) include removing the patient from the noise hazard and maintaining the patient in an effectively quiet environment (ambient levels 70 dB or less) for twenty-one (21) days.&nbsp; Noise isolation provides some recovery from AAT, but removes SMs from duty for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>The long term goal of the TIRM PMO is to make wounded warfighters whole by restoring form, function, and appearance.&nbsp; The outcome of this development will enable TIRM PMO to lead the development of products that will treat wounded warriors with NIHL in operational environments.</p>
<p>According to PINIHL Integrated Product Team (IPT) market research, the developmental phases of these pharmacological interventions with potential to protect from or mitigate NIHL currently range from preclinical to start of Phase 2 clinical studies.&nbsp; Therefore, the Government intends to release a request for proposals (RFP) to fulfill this requirement and promote innovation.</p>
<p>This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation has been scheduled to be released via FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) to the vendor community and will close 30 days after the issuance date.&nbsp; Specifications of the requirement will be provided in solicitation W81XWH-18-R-0025.</p>
<p>Anticipated Solicitation Release Date -&nbsp;10 July 2018<br />Anticipated Question Submission Date - 17 July 2018<br />Anticipated Proposal Submission Date -&nbsp;09 August 2018<br />Anticipated Award Date - 14 September 2018</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that the solicitation will result in the award of up to two (2) Cost Reimbursement contracts, each with up to sixty (60) months of performance.&nbsp; The Government intends to award the initial contract(s) for the completion of a Phase 2 clinical study.&nbsp; Subsequent optional tasks will be exercised if warranted.&nbsp; The Government's objectives will be outlined in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code selected for this acquisition is 541715-Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology); and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>This is an unrestricted procurement.&nbsp; Award shall be made on a competitive basis, using the best value tradeoff process among cost/price and non-cost/-price factors described at FAR 15.101-1.&nbsp; The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors.&nbsp; Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint.&nbsp; However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.&nbsp; The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>Those interested in obtaining the solicitation (once posted) can access it at the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at www.fbo.gov and search for solicitation W81XWH-18-R-0025.&nbsp; Vendors wishing to submit an offer are responsible for downloading their own copy of the RFP and for frequently monitoring the site for any amendments.&nbsp; Requests made by phone will not be accepted.&nbsp; No solicitations will be provided by hard copy, fax, or e-mail.&nbsp; Failure to respond to the electronically posted RFP and associated amendments prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals specified on the solicitation may render vendor offer non-responsive and result in rejection of the same.&nbsp; The Government is not responsible for any loss of internet connectivity or for an Offeror's inability to access the documents posted at the referenced website.</p>
<p>To be eligible for an award or payment from any DoD activity, Offerors must provide registration information to the System for Award Management (SAM)*.&nbsp; All Offerors must be registered prior to receiving an award.&nbsp; The Offeror's SAM record must include the NAICS that has been selected for this procurement.&nbsp; Registration instructions may be obtained, and online registration may be accomplished at www.sam.gov.&nbsp; This includes the online representations and certifications located within SAM.</p>
<p>* Registration of a new entity in SAM has changed as of 22 March 2018; the registrant must provide an original, signed notarized letter stating that you are the authorized Entity Administrator before your registration will be activated.&nbsp; Registration updates and renewals of existing entities in SAM has also changed as of 27 April.&nbsp; Please visit http://www.sam.gov and https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/office-of-systems-management/integrated-award-environment-iae/sam-update to learn more about these process changes.&nbsp; Please note that international entities must follow a different process.&nbsp; It is recommended that Offerors allow sufficient time to complete the SAM registration process.&nbsp; An entity can be registered in SAM under multiple NAICS if they are applicable to the entity's business.&nbsp; EARLY REGISTRATION IS ADVISED.</p>
