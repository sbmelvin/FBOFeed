<DESC><p>The United States Air Force Space and Missile System Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), is contemplating issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to United Launch Services, L.L.C. for Launch Services in support of the Air Force Wideband Gap Filler-4 (WGS-4) mission. One (1) mission will be added to the existing EELV Launch Services (ELS) contract with United Launch Services, L.L.C. This one (1) Launch Service will include requirements for the following: Core Vehicle and Upper Stage, Payload Fairing, Payload Adaptor, Mission Unique Hardware, Mission Assurance Instrumentation, and Booster Storage Costs (if required). The RFP will be issued 15 days after publication of this Notice of Contract Action (NOCA). The Government may elect not to award any launch service (described above) as a result of this solicitation.
<p>FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(i) states, "Full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to maintain a facility, producer, manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing supplies or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve industrial mobilization." A J&amp;A may permit Government missions to be awarded with less than full and open competition to United Launch Services, L.L.C. subject to the Competition in Contracting Act.</p>
<p>The Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW) has developed a New Entrant Evaluation Plan (NEEP). The NEEP defines a structured approach for the Wing to evaluate potential new entrants to perform Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) launch services. A "new entrant" is any contractor other than current providers of EELV launch services. The evaluation plan identifies the business and technical requirements for a new entrant to be eligible for award of launch services. A business evaluation will determine the responsibility of the new entrant, including financial resources, organization and functional expertise, adequacy of production and launch operations facilities, and the ability to obtain necessary construction and environmental permits. A technical evaluation will determine the new entrant's understanding of, and ability to meet, EELV systems requirements, design maturity, adequacy of development and qualification activities, manufacturing process quality, and demonstrated system flight worthiness. The result of the new entrant evaluation process will be a formal determination by the Commander, LRSW, submitted to and approved by the Commander, Space and Missile Center, as to the ability of the new entrant to compete for EELV launch services. The intent of this plan is to ensure new entrants are provided a prompt opportunity to demonstrate their abilities (at their own expense), while protecting the Government's need to acquire systems that meet requirements.<br />Any interested parties or new entrants may contact the PCO (address below) about receiving a copy of the NEEP. Responses from Small Businesses are encouraged. NAICS Code is 541712 with 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Any interested parties (or new entrants) must be: (1) U.S. manufacturers as defined in the in the 2005 Buy 3 Request for Proposal; (2) have successfully demonstrated two missions (intermediate or larger) that inserts payloads into their intended orbits; (3) meet the system requirements identified in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD II) as presented in the March 2005 System Performance Requirements Document (SPRD) for Buy 3; and (4) successfully completed the new entrant evaluation criteria (described above), at their own expense. Firms that did not perform under the Low Cost Concept Validation, Engineering and Manufacturing Development, and Initial Launch Services contracts, yet believe they can satisfy technical requirements and solicitation provisions as contractors for the EELV launch services, are encouraged to submit a Statement of Capability and qualification (limited to four (4) pages) addressing the above criteria within seven (7) calendar days of this synopsis to: LRSW/PK, Attn: Ms Lorraine Lewis-Wilson, 483 North Aviation Blvd, El Segundo, CA 90245-2808. Prior EELV experience has shown that the new entrant certification tim period may be longer than the acquisition timeline for the missions identified in this NOCA. Therefore, other interested parties are welcome to use this NOCA and the described New Entrant Evaluation Plan to initiate activity towards qualifying their launch system for future EELV launch services. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, nor to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein. Note 22.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitute the only solicitation: quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, RMM00090016, is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC-32).  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code is 541611 and the business size maximum is $7.0 Million.   The SINGLE Seat Belt Survey Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract shall be awarded as a firm fixed contract with a Period of Performance (POP) of a base year of 365 calendar days with two (2) option years of 365 calendar days each for a total of three years. The contractor will have total of 365 calendar days (base year) from date of contract award to complete requirements outlined in the scope of work.   All work shall be performed in accordance with the Statement of Work. The offeror for the base and two option years shall provide the lump sum cost with a breakdown of their cost to provide this service and respond to the Evaluation Factors delineated at the end of this synopsis. STATEMENT OF WORK. I. Background: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Indian Highway Safety Program (IHSP) sponsored a project in 2005 to establish the first baseline Tribal Reservation safety belt usage rage and develop the methodology to use in the future to track trends and specific program effects.  The survey design is similar to NHTSA's National Occupant Protection Usage Survey (NOPUS), a probability based survey that reports a single belt usage rate for the nation.  The goal of the project was to gather a single belt usage rate for Tribal reservations that could track progress towards increasing safety belt usage. Although there are over 560 federally recognized Tribes in this country, approximately 180 of these Tribes have safety belt use subject to Tribal law and Trial traffic law enforcement.  For the purposes of the survey, Tribes have been classified according to their geographic areas.  The Northwest (Washington State, Oregon and Idaho), Northern Plains (Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota), Southwest (California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico), Great Lakes (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio), South Central (Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana), and South and East (all remaining states excluding Hawaii and Alaska).  Within these regions, 61 reservations have populations of 2,000 or more, which represents approximately 660,000 people or 93 percent of the populations on tribal reservations.  Native Americans make up 61 percent of the populations on all tribal reservations.  As a result of the passage of SAFETEA-LU (August 2005), all state programs receiving fund for highway safety must not conduct safety belt surveys. II. SCOPE:  Yearly, the national "Indian Country" seat belt survey must be conducted in order to keep the program in compliance and eligible to receive program funds.  III. Objectives: The successful selected provider must replicate the methods, sampling procedures, survey protocols, and statistical analysis as described in Safety Belt Use Estimate for the Indian Nation "State" by Leaf and Solomon in 2005 and 2006.  The report is posted on NHTSA's website and the link is: http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/nhts/menuitem.2d62007aac5298598fcb6010dba046a0/.   The sampling plan was designed to provide a reliable estimate of belt use across all the Tribal reservations subject to Tribal law and Tribal traffic law enforcement.  The sampling procedure weighted all Tribal reservations proportional to their populations and included the criteria that the sample of the Tribal reservations. 1.  Be limited to Tribal reservations with populations of 2,000 or more;  2.  Represent varying conditions;  3.  Be from all areas of the country; and  4.  Include enough sites per reservation so that the final combined safety belt use rate would be reliable.  The object is a sample from each area at a rate approximately 1 in 4 reservations or 1 reservation per 30,000 population.   IV. Tasks:  In order to complete the work required, the successful provider (contractor) must:  1.   Be able to collect the data based on the protocol described above and in the Safety Belt Use Estimate for the Indian Nation "State" by Leaf and Solomon.  2.   Replicate the observation and training protocols outlined in the 2005 and 2006 report.  3.   Randomly reorder the list of Tribal reservations so that every reservation has equal probability of being first, second, etc. on the list.  4.  NOTE: ALL ? SYMBOLS = SUM SYMBOLS WITH A j BELOW IT SINCE THE ACQUISITION SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE SUM SYMBOLS) .  Set each Tribal reservations initial weight for being selected on a single selection equal to the proportion of the reservations population to the total population of all eligible reservations within the area  wij = Popij/? Popij , where wij = initial weight for selection on a single election for reservation j within Area I,   Popij = population of reservation j within Area I and  /? Popij = sum of the population of all reservations eligible for selection within Area i.   (Within each Area, these initial weights add to exactly 1.0).  5.   For Areas sampling a single Tribal reservation set the selection cutoff lever sij = wij.  6.   .  NOTE: ALL ? SYMBOLS = SUM SYMBOLS WITH A j BELOW IT SINCE THE ACQUISITION SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE SUM SYMBOLS) .  For Areas sampling more than on Tribal reservation, adjust the cut off levels to select all of the Tribal reservations in a single sampling according to the formula:  sij = (1-(1-wij)ni) o ni / ?(1-(1-wij)ni)  where sij = selection cut off level for reservation j in Area I and ni = number of reservation to be selected within Area i.  (Within Area i, the sum of the adjusted weights = ni.)  in all cases, the sij cut off levels correspond roughly to the probability of the reservation being included in the final sample.  7.   Generate a random number (from a rectangular distribution between 0 and 1) for each Tribal reservation.  8.   Starting at the top of the list, select for inclusion each Tribal reservation whose random number is less than (or equal to) its adjusted selection cutoff, up to the number required to be sampled.  9.   If the number of reservations selected is less than the number required, select additional Tribal reservations from the pool, selecting first the one whose random number exceeds its cutoff level by the least amount, etc., until the number of required Tribal reservations has been identified.  10.   Conduct the observation surveys during the month of June at the same time as States are conducting their representative statewide surveys.  This time period immediately follows the Click It or Ticket high visibility enforcement campaign.  11.   Implement quality control procedures to assure that observation schedules are met.  12.   Analyze the observation data in accordance with procedures outlined in the 2005 and 2006 Indian Nation safety belt report.  Any changes must be approved in writing by NHTSA.  13.   Prepare a written report, suitable for reproduction, of the data collection activities.  The report must describe how the data were collected and analyzed.  It will include an introduction, background, methods, results and analysis section with supporting graphs, tables.  The final report must be submitted not later than March 31 of the following year.  14.   Submit a copy of the final report on diskette and in HTML and PDF formats to be loaded onto NHTSA's homepage.  V. Delivery:  Survey work on the reservations selected must commence immediately following the national seat belt mobilization (June) and be completed by December of the same year.  The annual report must be completed by March 31, of the following year.  VI. Government Furnished Property:  No government property will be furnished in order to satisfy the requirements of the contract.  VII. Security:  None identified.  VIII. Place of Performance:  Survey locations can/will be onTribal reservations throughout the United States.  Report writing and generation will be at the contractor's facility.  IX.

<DESC>NECO SYNOPSIS
(FOR SOLE SOURCE)

The Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWCCD) has a requirement to purchase the Tobii Eye Tracker System X60. Components include the eye tracker module, necessary cabling, padded carrying case, adjustable mounting arm, and accompanying software. 
Tobii Technology Inc. is the only manufacturer that could maintain the necessary eye-gaze accuracy required and the software to develop and analyze at our discretion, while also outputting the necessary data of interest. This system also can accommodate eye tracking in a three dimensional environment. Other features has varying degrees for calibration, the randomizations of stimuli during analysis, recording audio in parallel with recorded data, a real time validity code for each eye during testing, and an accuracy of 0.5 degrees.
In support of this effort, NSWCCD intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to Tobii Technology Inc.  The basis for a sole source is that Tobii Technology Inc. is the only source available to obtain a tracker system that has less long term risks for mechanical failure.  
A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Information concerning this procurement may be made to Government POC on or before 06/24/2009, referencing RFQ N00167-09-T-0157.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Tracewell Systems, 567 Enterprise Dr., Westerville, OH 43031 on a sole source basis for five (5) each CDR Replace Chassis P/N 510-1171-F00-00.  The  IPCDR enclosure has been specifically developed to meet the NAVSEA technical requirements as provided on the System Baseline Configuration 2 (SBC2) product specification during the product's initial development phase.  No other sources for this chassis enclosure currently exists.  As this is a prototype for refresh development procurement, no additional purchase requirements have been identified at this time.  It is in the best interest of the government to acquire this item using a non-competitive purchase for the following: Tracewell is the only company that makes the IPCDR chassis enclosure that will meet the form, fit, function and interchangeability requirements for the CDRU Assembly.  Developing another source for this chas! sis would be cost and schedule prohibitive especially as the government has no plans at this point to purchase additional units beyond the development until the design has been proven.

<a href="mailto:lower.angela@epa.gov">ANGELA M. LOWER</a>
<DESC>Technical Support for the Drinking Water Optimization Program.
The EPA Office of Water requires a contractor that can provide technical support for continued implementation and expansion of the drinking water Optimization Program.  The goal of the Optimization Program is to improve the quality of public drinking water by maximizing the effectiveness of drinking water treatment, conveyance, and storage, through operational changes and with limited capital expenditure.  The contractor will work directly with state and EPA regional drinking water programs to optimize water quality at public water systems.  Currently, there are 21 states and 4 EPA regional offices participating in the Optimization Program.
Contract support shall require a superior level of technical and implementation expertise in the areas of drinking water treatment optimization, and maintaining water quality in distribution system storage and conveyance facilities.  Contract Support shall also require a working knowledge of the existing Composite Correction Program, which is the basis for most Optimization Program activities. 
The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment and facilities in support of the efforts delineated by the performance work statement (PWS).  Services to be performed include: ?	Development of analytical tools (e.g., spreadsheets), operational procedures and training curricula for use by state and EPA staff members while working with public water system personnel.  These efforts may include reviews of current science and engineering literature, as well as direct communication with appropriate experts, in areas such as particle removal, disinfection, and disinfection byproduct formation in surface water and ground water systems. ?	Demonstrate the effective use of the aforementioned analytical tools, operational procedures and training curricula to state and EPA staff members participating in the Optimization Program.?	Facilitate the implementation of state and EPA Area-Wide Optimization Programs through the use of strategic implementation meetings, conducting training workshops, and the provision of targeted assistance for individual public water systems.
A draft PWS can be obtained from the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/. It is anticipated that the contract will be a Firm Fixed Price contract starting in February 2010 with a one year Base Period and four Optional Periods of 12 months each.  Approximately 2,200 Level of Effort (LOE) hours are anticipated for each contract period with contractor?s needing to provide as much as an additional 2,200 hours for a total of 22,000 hours in total for all periods if all the potential LOE hours are realized.   This requirement was previously competed and awarded as a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract and EPA?s intention is to undertake the prospective requirement by employing a Firm-Fixed Price contract.  Historical data from previous contract option period is attached, indicating the Level of Effort and Other Direct Cost usage.  The historical data can be obtained from the Office of Acquisition Management?s website http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  
This requirement is a total small business set-aside. The applicable NAICS code is 541330 with a size standard of $4,500,000. The solicitation is expected to be posted to the internet in July 2009, as Solicitation Number PR-CI-09-10674 and may be accessed through the EPA?s home page on the World Wide Web (www.epa.gov) or through the direct link URL:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  No hard copies of the solicitation shall be provided. It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the EPA website for updates or changes. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Design-Build Modernization of the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building, Denver, Colorado. GSA will be using funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for this project.

This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation&rsquo;s most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 &ndash; 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA&rsquo;s P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required. Projects in or affecting historic properties must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Secretary of the Interior&rsquo;s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This facility must be designed in metric units. This project will be delivered through the Design-Build delivery method. PROJECT DESCRIPTION The project consists of a major modernization upgrade project for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building (FB) and a window replacement project for the adjacent Byron G. Rogers U.S. Courthouse. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The FB occupies a prominent position in the Federal District of downtown Denver. It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 18 stories and a basement. The FB contains 494,156 gross square feet (GSF), 437,551 rentable square feet (RSF), and 329,433 usable square feet (USF). The current FB tenants will be relocated prior to the start of the modernization project. Agencies to be located in the federal building will be the Commission on Civil Rights, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Social Security Administration, and the General Services Administration. The courthouse is a multi-tenant office and court building. It is five stories high with a basement and subbasement connected to the FB by a two story section. This section contains building services, a loading dock, and a two lane ramp to the parking garage. The courthouse houses six major tenants including United States District Court, Court Administrative Support Center, Probation and Pre-Trial Services, U.S. 10th Circuit Library, 10th Circuit Mediation and the United States Marshals Service. The building is approximately 248,000 GSF including two levels of underground parking spaces within the basement and sub-basement. A comprehensive modernization project for the courthouse was completed in 2005. The courthouse will remain occupied while the windows are replaced. The federal building and courthouse are located at 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado, 80294. Both buildings are long-term GSA-held assets situated in a prime location near downtown with public transportation within the central business district, in the Federal District of downtown Denver, with a stable tenant base and a high reinvestment need. Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the tenants&rsquo; existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. GSA requires all new construction, renovation, and modernization projects to be certified through the LEED program; owing to the historic significance of the building, all work will follow the Secretary of the Interior&rsquo;s Standards and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, Revised 1992 (36 CFR 67); upgrade the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; upgrade the mechanical piping, heating, and hot water systems; upgrade the electrical system and install new telecommunications infrastructure; modernize all elevators; remove all asbestos containing materials (ACMs); implement GSA&rsquo;s workplace procedures and achieve measurable effectiveness results; identify design strategies that work to optimize the project&rsquo;s access to energy from seasonal solar, natural lighting, and wind to reduce undesirable loads and maximize desirable loads to meet desired energy targets for the facility; upgrade by replacing all public and private restrooms, plumbing systems, and fixtures; upgrade building security; replace underground water and waste water service lines. Project goals and objectives for the courthouse are to improve energy efficiency of building by installing high-efficiency windows; upgrade building security and safety by replacing windows.

PROCUREMENT STRATEGY The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two.

All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)). In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement. In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304 Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions. The RFQ will be issued electronically after 06/29/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12, an Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Central Region, Geographic Information Office (RPC), NSDI PO (Louisiana) located at 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 has a requirement for non-competitive procurement to the Regional Planning Commission in New Orleans for high resolution orthorectified aerial photography covering the greater New Orleans area. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is responding to a Department of Defense (DOD) request for current high-resolution imagery data over 134 urban areas in support of Homeland Security. The imagery data will be utilized at the Federal level for homeland security purposes, emergency preparedness and response, natural resource studies, planning and economic development, and agricultural census. The imagery data will provide the basis to update various databases in the National Spatial Data Infrastructure, including transporation, structures, land use, land cover, and hydrography. This USGS project will leverage the 1340 Poydras St. Suite 2100, New Orleans, LA 70112, existing agreement with Digit Globe. Orthorectified digital imagery has been acquired for 3,548 square miles as 1-foot resolution natural color, appropriate for 1:4800 scale mapping for 1-foot resolution. Products will include 8 bit D)QQQ GeoTIFFs (with .twf files), metadata with each file, and a shapefile and jpeg of the grid used for the flight. The anticipated delivery date to USGS is July 2009.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one source, Ederer, LLC (small business), Seattle, WA, for the purpose of increasing the load rating (up-rating) of two existing derrick cranes at the McNary Dam navigation lock.  This will result in a firm fixed price contract.  The services required are to perform a detailed design analysis, design, and modifications to two (2) derrick cranes at McNary Lock and Dam to increase their main load line hoisting capacity at 80 ft radius by 15%.  Also included will be load testing and recertification of the cranes.  Ederer, LLC, holds proprietary rights to the specific technical data and design calculations for the existing cranes, including fatigue factors, factors of safety on loads and stresses, and resultant maximum load capacity as a function of frequency of maximum load picks.   The design of these two cranes is a highly specialized service and up-rating of them is a follow-on contract to the original design.  Ederer, LLC is the only company with the original design information for the derrick cranes.   <BR>

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS! The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Southern Methodist University (SMU) for information and planning purposes in support of the nuclear test ban treaty. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the government nor will the government pay for information solicited. This is a follow-on effort to expand the capabilities of the Seismo-Acoustic Monitoring Program. Primary performance will be in the Republic of Korea (ROK). This program requires the deployment of geophysical and acoustic data acquisition equipment to assist in the identification of small size, natural and man-made seismo-acoustic signatures. This project will also conduct research to develop seismo-acoustic analysis methodologies for data from multiple arrays for detection, location and analysis of seismic events. Data evaluation and development of analytical tools are required. Contractor must also have an existing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Korean Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Research (KIGAM), or secure a MOU within 6 months from the closing date of this announcement. Information on KIGAM can be found at http://www.kigam.re.kr/english/#. Contractor must have, or be able to construct, a test site large enough to deploy and test seismo-acoustic arrays, including the necessary infrastructure for research, analysis and transmission of data. Period of performance is for a 2-month base plus four one-year options. This is a Sole Source with SMU IAW FAR 6.302-1. SMU is the only known source with the required combination of research, development, host relationships/agreements and operational capability in the seismo-acoustic field to meet mission requirements. SMU combines a unique team of researchers with expertise in both seismic and infrasound wave propagation and analysis. SMU has an existing MOU with KIGAM to operate and sustain seismic and acoustic arrays in the ROK. SMU is completing its tenth year of work in ROK installing and operating this type of geophysical equipment. No solicitation documents exist at this time. This service utilizes North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541360. Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis. 45 CONS/LGCCA has determined that SMU is the only source capable of providing this requirement. Phone calls will not be accepted. Point of contact is Ms Pat Bosinger, Contracting Officer, 45 CONS/LGCCA, 1030 South Highway A1A, Patrick AFB, FL 32925, or email pat.bosinger@patrick.af.mil.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<p>Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), 8532 Marina Bay Dr., MacDill AFB, FL 33621, requires the purchase of two Internet Protocol Terminal acessory kits to replace items that were re-appropriated for mission spares. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to DataPath, Inc., 2450 Satellite Boulevard, Duluth, GA., 30096. Interested parties may e-mail Barbara Squitieri at barbara.squitieri@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, no later than Tuesday, 16 June 2009, 9:00 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by Thursday, 28 May 2009, 9:00 a.m. EST will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)<br />The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), Deployable Joint Command and Control System currently has 71 functional SWE-DISH systems with accessory kits, and an additional 10 incomplete SWE-DISH systems without accessory kits. The SWE-DISH are the primary means of satellite communications at deployed JCSE locations, and the ones in-garrison are used for training. A sources sought was posted on FedBizOps for 4 days. No responses were received. As a result of this, it appears that DataPath is the only vendor who provides SWE-DISH satellite communications terminals, accessories and replacement parts. This was confirmed in an e-mail from SWE-DISH (see attached). The action being processed is for the purchase of two IPT accessory kits to make the SWE-DISH satellite terminals complete and operational.</p>

<DESC>Louis Stokes ClevelandDepartment of Veterans Affairs Medical CenterVISN 10 Contracting ManagementJustification and Approval for Other than Full and Open CompetitionUpon the basis of the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contract action is hereby recommended for approval pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source.1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity  The Louis Stokes Cleveland, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VMAC), Brecksville, Ohio, 44141, VISN 10 Contracting Activity, Acquisition Management Service2.	Nature/Description of ActionThis activity proposes to use sole source procurement procedures to purchase a Carto XP Navigation System from Biosense Webster for the Wade Park Cardiac Lab.  3.	Description of Supplies/ServicesThe Carto XP Navigation System is an electroanatomical navigation system used to view the electrical activity of the heart through real-time data on 3-D, color-coded cardiac maps.  It is a irrigated cardiac catheter ablation system that will be used for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.4.	Identification of Statutory Authority(X) 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)    Only One Responsible Source( ) 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2)    Unusual and Compelling Urgency(  ) 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (3)    Industrial, Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental, or                                                                                                                                                     Research Capability or Expert Services(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (4)   International Agreement(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (5)   Authorized or Required by Statute(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (6)   National Security(  )  41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (7)   Public Interest5.	Demonstration of Contractor's Unique QualificationsThis is the only system that uses ablation catheters approved for atrial fibrillation by the FDA.  Recently, other catheters, such as St. Jude, (previously approved for Biosense Webster and Hansen Medical Systems) were found to cause life-threatening complications when performing catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.  We currently have the Hansen Medical cardiac catheter system, so this system will no longer be used to perform catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.6.  Publicized RequirementsThe intent to sole source notice will be posted on FBO.7.	Determination of a Fair and Reasonable CostThe list price for all equipment for this system, as well as a one year service agreement is $477,000.00.  The price being offered to the government is $253,000.00.8.	Market SurveyThe FDA adverse event report for the Hansen Medical catheter ablation system, as well as the FDA letter approving the Biosense Webster catheters were sent to the contract specialist intern.  In addition, an article was found that confirmed that these are the first and only ablation catheters approved for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.9.	Other Supporting Data None10.	  Actions taken to remove barriers to competitionNone11.  Acquisition Plan: An Acquisition Plan   (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition.12. IT Approval: IT Approval (  ) is (X) is not required for this acquisition. If it is, include appropriate approvals.The assertions and recommendations in support of the justification have been prepared by:_______________________________________________________________________Technical Representative                                         Date                       PhoneContracting Officers CertificationThe Contracting Officer has determined that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief.__________________________________________________        __________________Contracting Officer	                           Not exceeding $500K               Date                                  ______________________________________________                 _______________One Level above Contracting Officer, Exceeding $500K                    Date                             CONCURRED BY:___________________________________________________			__________________ Head of Contracting Activity   Over $500K not exceeding $10 Mil	Date

<CONTACT>Vinton M. Grant, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-385-2348, Email vinton.grant@dot.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent by Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to award a sole source contract to Software AG USA, 11700 Plaza American Drive, Suite 700, Reston, VA 20190. The requirement is for WebMethods BPMS Quick Start Edition to include software support, maintenance and training.

FMCSA requires software to provide a business rules engine process that integrates into the COMPASS Program. COMPASS is an agency wide initiative leveraging new technology to transform the way FMCSA does business.   The program objectives are to create a single source for crucial safety data via single sign-on access; improving data quality to enable better, more informed decision making; and providing actionable information as well as data. COMPASS is driven by FMCSA’a commitment to improving truck and bus safety and saving lives. By creating a single source for crucial safety data, collecting and managing data more effectively, and improving data quality, the program will improve the ability to save lives and help streamline the daily processes and operations of the enforcement community and the industry.  

  

The contract for development of the COMPASS IT infrastructure was through Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) contract number 1435-04-05-RC-43269. SAIC was responsible for the procurement of software. WebMethods software as provided by Software AG USA was purchased and the license transferred to FMCSA through the existing contract. WebMethods software is inherent to the continuing functionality of COMPASS and is the only software that will fully integrate with the existing COMPASS architecture without significant cost and time.  

This award will be made in accordance with FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements as a follow on to an existing contract.  The services are highly specialized and it is likely that an award to any other source would result in duplication of cost to the government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source simplified acquisition under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b) to SET Consulting, College Park, MD 20740 for continued support for the voluntary voting systems guidelines (VVSG) to include, but not limited to: document development, production, public review and analysis, and training. 
This work requires a Contractor with in-depth knowledge and experience with the VVSG and the Election Assistance Commission, as the work done at NIST is done in close cooperation with the EAC, and historically the requirements from the EAC have changed quickly and dramatically. SET Consulting has been working at NIST since 2006 and has in-depth experience in the VVSG requirements. The in-depth understanding of voting systems standards that SET has acquired as well as the expertise it has displayed in producing voting systems standards for NIST are uncommon and unique. Due to the fluctuation in the amount and complexity of the work required, it is anticipated that a labor-hour type purchase order will be awarded, with a base and two option years. No RFQ package is available. Any interested party may submit, in writing, their capability statement to respond to this requirement. However, a determination by the Government to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for quotes. If no affirmative responses are received by June 22, 2009 at 10:00am the Contracting Officer will proceed with the award to SET Consulting.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute for Neurological Disorder and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a sole source purchase order to Molecular Dimensions, Inc, PO Box 1001, Apopka, Florida, 32704-1001 for the purchase of crystallization grade incubators (MD5-02) for storage of large numbers of crystallization experiments from throughput crystallization screens.  National Institute for Neurological Disorder and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research on the regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton and the defects in this regulation in neurodegenerative disorders.  This study aimed at deciphering the high-resolution atomic structures of proteins that regulate the microtubule cytoskeleton and are defective in neurodegenerative disorders.  One of the techniques used to unravel the high-resolution structure of these proteins is X-ray crystallography.  This technique allows the visualization at Angstrom resolution of protein structure.  This research requires the storage of tens of thousands of crystallization experiments in incubators that offer very stable temperature control and a vibration free environment. The research of three such incubators, each to be set at a different temperature since proteins are known to have different behavior and stability in crystallization trials depending on temperature, thus making temperature a critical variable in the crystallization experiment.
Molecular Dimensions supplies the only cooled incubators specifically designed for crystal growth that requires very precise temperature control, high temperature stability over long periods of time and an essentially vibration free environment. The incubators supplied by Molecular Dimension are the only incubators on the market that offer +/- 0.5 degrees temperature variation and a vibration free environment.  
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.
Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 1110355 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2080 and Attention: Jasmine Snoddy, Contract Specialist.

<DESC>U. S. Department of State intends to award a sole source contract to Beers Enterprises, Inc., 969 Main St., Osterville, MA 02655 for the Washington Switch service.  The Department proposes to enter into this contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) only one available source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Department’s requirements.
 
The Bureau of Public Affairs, Office of Broadcast Services (PA/OBS) maintains two television facilities located at the Truman Building and the National Press Building.  PA/OBS requires full time television broadcast connectivity and switching services from these facilities for State Department content distribution to broadcasters across the world.  

Beers Enterprises and their facility, The DC Switch is the only contractor that provides peer-to-peer, customer-controlled multi-port source and destination switching for broadcasters across the United States and throughout the world.  This is the only service that enables the State Department to have direct and indirect access to hundreds of domestic and international broadcasters through on-demand transmission gateways in Washington D.C., New York, Los Angeles and Miami.  

Beers Enterprises will provide the State Department with exclusive on-demand transmission and reception services with hundreds of domestic and global broadcasters with the following transmission services:

1)	One (1) TV-1 analog video fiber circuit, one (1) Switch Input Port from the US State Dep’t facility to The DC Switch facility.
2)	One (1) TV-1 analog video fiber circuit, one (1) Switch Output Port from The DC Switch facility to the US State Dep’t facility.
3)	One (1) Control System - US State Dep’t is providing a secure internet connection for the web-enabled control system.
4)	Hybrid Digital/Analog television customer-controlled on-demand switching centers in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington, D.C.

The State Department’s original distribution network provided by the Verizon Washington, D.C. AVOC is actually a series of switches that limit the volume of connectivity to 32 fixed transmit and receive ports, but allow for 4 simultaneous streams or paths.  The Beers DC switch is the only service that expands this connectivity to over 100 transmit and receive ports each in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington, D.C., but across just one path.   The Beers DC Switch is the only facility that can provide these robust services and serve as the full-time back-up to the State Department’s original distribution network provided by the Verizon Washington, D.C. AVOC.  The Beers DC Switch and Verizon services are very different and neither can compete with the other.  They offer the State Department an effective primary and back-up capability, with Verizon offering 4 simultaneous two-way paths to 32 fixed transmit and receive ports, and The DC Switch offering 1 two-way path to over 100 transmit and receive ports.

This notice is neither a request for competitive proposals nor a solicitation of offers. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS FOR PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification using Recovery Act funding to contract number W91278-06-C-0003, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, West Point Project, West Point Georgia, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work (inside the powerhouse):  1) install new fixtures in six (6) restrooms; 2) prepare, prime and paint interior wall surfaces; and 3) strip and reseal all floors.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1)  The contractor has experience with working around power generation schedules due to the operation of rotating equipment.   2)  The contractor has experience with working around the existing contractor whos performing on-site rehabilitation of generator units 2 and 3.  3) The contractor has experience in working around high voltage equipment, arc flash hazard, and suspended platforms. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen circumstance encountered during the job.<BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>The United States Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") under its Enhanced-Use Leasing authority (38 U.S.C.  8161 - 8169), is seeking "expressions of interest" from bidders interested in a development opportunity for a Veterans' Park at the Canandaigua Veterans Medical Center (Canandaigua VAMC). See below for information about the available parcel of land. VA requests expressions of interest from a developer/lessee to build, occupy, and operate with a leasehold interest, a homeless housing project.Through this enhanced-use authority, VA can offer long-term use of assets (up to 75 years) in order to accommodate the scope of the project. The developer/operator will be required to finance, design, construct, occupy, and operate the facility and all site improvements in accordance with State of Michigan regulations and the applicable local codes of the City of Iron Mountain. In return for the long-term use of the assets, the developer/operator/lessee will provide "fair consideration" to VA. VA's primary objective is to assist homeless Veterans to obtain housing.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additionalinformation included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the onlysolicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Request for Quotation (RFQ) to Software andEngineering Associates, Inc., Nevada  for:Solid Performance Program (SPP 08) and Two Dimensional Kinetics (TDK 08) Site Licensesand Codes in support of Atlas V Rocket analysis.Last item. Software and Engineering Associates, Inc. is currently the only company that developsand maintains the code for the SPP and TDK.  The Solid Performance Program, SPP'08, is asuper set of the SPP 7.2 code.	Both codes use the standard Joint Army, Navy, NASA, AirForce (JANNAF) methods for performance predictions of Solid Propellant Engines.  Theanalysis consists of two parts: nozzle performance and motor performance.  The SPP'08nozzle module analyzes and summarizes the performance loss mechanism into fivecategories: combustion chamber loss, boundary layer loss, chemical kinetic loss, particlelosses, and divergence losses.	The motor performance analysis consists of four separategrain design modules and two internal ballistics modules.  The grain design modules areinternally linked with the one dimensional motor ballistics modules.  The motor stabilitycan be analyzed with axial mode Standard Stability Prediction (SSP) code which isinternally linked with the 2-D, axismetric, and 3-D grain design and ballistic modules todefine burn rates, motor surface, and port areas required by the SSP.  TDK'08 is thelatest version of  JANNAF standard code for the prediction of nozzle performance inliquid rocket engines.	TDK'08 analyzes and summarizes the performance loss mechanismsinto four categories: Combustion chamber loss, boundary layer losses, chemical keneticslosses, and divergence losses.Extensive research showed that the software being procured is one of a kind and iscurrently only provided by Software and Engineering Associates.  The use of this softwareis very specific and only applicable to solid rocket motors, therefore, creating lowdemand for the software and in turn only having only one provider.  Other versions of thesoftware exist but have been modified and deemed proprietary by solid rocket motormanufactures.  During my thirteen year career in Solid Rocket Motor both at MarshallSpace Flight Center and Kennedy Space Center I have not encountered any other softwarethat can perform solid motor analysis. In addition, TDK and SPP have been deemed thestandard for JANNAF since no other software exist that can perform the same analysisrequired on the Atlas V Rocket.The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-32This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 511210, $25 million respectively.

The NRCS envisions entering into Multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA's) with qualified offerors capable of providing technical reviews of appraisals. A BPA is a method of filling anticipated needs. It is not a contract. The Government is not obligated to place any orders nor is the vendor obligated to accept any orders. For each work assignment, the Government will request technical reviews through the issuance of a BPA call order from those firms that have been awarded BPA's.



Individual call orders shall be submitted in accordance with the terms agreed to in the BPA's. Government personnel authorized to place call orders under the BPA will be identified on the BPA's by name and telephone number. The contractor will be expected to furnish the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the BPA, without the need for additional paperwork beyond the Statement of Work that accompanies the order.



Timely delivery of complete and accurate technical review reports is crucial to the success of NRCS programs. Call orders are to be completed within 14 days of the call order date. If the contractor is unable to provide the technical review report within the 14 day period, NRCS is to be notified; otherwise, it is expected to receive the technical review report within 14 business days.


PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Technical review services are being sought for a period of five years with a contract period of July 13, 2009 to September 30, 2014. The BPA will remain in effect until cancelled by either party.

<p>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL<br />Transportation Infrastructure Technical Study</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 541330</p>
<p>1. PURPOSE<br />This Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued to establish a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Contract that acquires consultant services to conduct a technical analysis resulting in feasible alternatives on how to reconfigure the transportation infrastructure of the 10th Street, SW corridor utilizing sustainable infrastructure, while maintaining and increasing multi-modal connectivity.</p>
<p>2. OVERVIEW</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) is the federal government's central planning agency for federal land and buildings in the National Capital Region. NCPC's jurisdiction covers 2,500 square miles, including the District of Columbia and surrounding counties in Maryland and Virginia. In April 2009, NCPC adopted the Monumental Core Framework Plan to guide future development decisions that will shape the historic core of Washington. The Monumental Core Framework Plan can be downloaded at http://www.ncpc.gov/initiatives/pg.asp?p=frameworkplan. A cornerstone initiative of this plan is the 10th Street, SW corridor, which is roughly defined as the area from 9th Street, SW to 12th Street, SW and from Independence Avenue to the north and the 10th Street Overlook to the south. This area is depicted in the graphic attached at the end of this notice. As a primary future connection between the National Mall and the burgeoning Southwest Waterfront, 10th Street, SW offers an opportunity to create an active, cultural, green corridor that accommodates major federal establishments, active retail uses and exciting cultural developments. To achieve this vision the Monumental Core Framework Plan suggests major physical moves that reconfigure the extensive transportation infrastructure, including roadway networks and pedestrian areas so that access to and within this area can be improved.</p>
<p>The scope of work described below looks to analyze the physical feasibility of reconfiguring 10th Street, SW. In doing so, the analysis will develop alternative approaches to establishing a functioning street grid at appropriate grades, while utilizing sustainable infrastructure and increasing multi-modal connectivity. As these alternatives will establish the form of streets and the public realm, they must also lay the foundation that will be used in analyzing physical space in further studies. The ultimate goal of this Transportation Infrastructure Technical Study is to develop technically feasible alternatives in cooperation with NCPC staff and relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>Products:</p>
<p>The product summary listed here and the associated specific tasks are described more fully in the subsequent Scope of Work (part 3). Please note that the contractor will be expected to identify and illustrate a maximum of three alternatives under this scope of work. In anticipation of the possibility that less than three alternatives will be required by NCPC, the consultant proposal should reflect the magnitude of cost reductions should a lower number of alternatives be decided.</p>
<p>Product Summary:</p>
<p>&bull; One draft illustration of each transportation infrastructure alternative in plan view with accompanying narrative description. (Task 2)<br />&bull; Two draft sectional drawings at various points of each alternative. (Task 2)<br />&bull; Identification of relevant sustainable infrastructure precedents with descriptions and images. (Task 2)<br />&bull; One final illustration of each transportation infrastructure alternative in plan view with accompanying narrative description. (Task 3)<br />&bull; Two final sectional drawings at various points of each alternative. (Task 3)<br />&bull; Attendance and participation at two stakeholder meetings. (Task 4)<br />&bull; Presentation at one of the two stakeholder meetings. (Task 4)</p>
<p><br />3. SCOPE OF WORK (Each Task must be separately priced):</p>
<p>Task One - Project Kick Off</p>
<p>A kick off meeting will be held between the consultant team, key NCPC staff and other outside parties as determined by NCPC staff. The goal of this meeting will be to answer questions or clarify aspects of the scope of work, establish project schedule and key points of contact. This meeting will also include a site visit to the 10th Street Corridor to discuss the issues in the field.</p>
<p>Task Two - Draft Alternatives</p>
<p>The goal of Task Two is to analyze existing conditions and information related to the road network and related transportation infrastructure, including transit conditions and to develop initial alternatives. These alternatives must be developed in coordination with NCPC staff and reflect different, but feasible approaches to reconfiguring the corridor in accordance with recommendations in the Monumental Core Framework Plan while maintaining and improving the connectivity of the area. These alternatives must look at reconfiguring the road network, accommodating transit opportunities, improving the public realm, and decking Interstate 395 to create potential infill development sites within the corridor. In all cases the alternatives must incorporate the use of sustainable infrastructure features where possible and the illustrations must clearly reference and describe the type of sustainable technology to be utilized. The alternatives must be illustrated in plan view that show road configurations, including width, cartways, pedestrian space, areas for transit, as well as adjacent building envelopes. In addition to these alternatives, two sectional drawings must be created at various points of each draft alternative to reflect above and below grade conditions. The location for each section cut must be determined in coordination with NCPC staff. To further express the sustainable infrastructure component, information on relevant precedents must be provided. This information should include one to two images and accompanying descriptions</p>
<p>Once the drafts of these products are complete they must be transmitted to NCPC Staff for review at which time a review meeting will be scheduled to discuss comments and edits.</p>
<p>Products: Draft alternative illustrations, accompanying narrative, sustainability precedents and sections.</p>

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers.  The following factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price:
1) Proposals will be evaluated on the extent to which the offeror understands the task areas and technical requirements as described in the Statement of Work.  This evaluation factor will include the extent to which the proposal indicates a clear understanding of the importance of both the radar absorbing material performance and its layout within the Central Target Simulator (CTS) anechoic chamber to achieve the specified anechoic chamber performance, the extent to which the proposal includes either a new layout or states clearly that the current layout will be used, whether the proposal includes data from simulations/analyses that summarizes the expected performance of the refurbished CTS anechoic chamber, and whether the proposal includes data sheets for the types of radar absorbing material to be used on the project that show that the absorption, fire retardancy, and reflectivity specifications will be met.  Also to be considered is whether the offeror manufactures and installs RAM and the extent to which the offeror understands the design of anechoic chambers.
2) Proposals will be evaluated on the offerors ability to schedule, manage and execute the work outlined in the Statement of Work. This evaluation will include the extent to which the offeror provides information on the team it proposes to execute this project, including which parts of the effort each team member will perform, and how the proposed team will work together to accomplish the overall effort.  The evaluation will also include the extent to which a project manager is proposed, the expertise and experience of this individual in managing similar projects, and the amount of corporate resources available to this manager.  This evaluation will also include whether the offeror provides a schedule for the project, including the amount of downtime anticipated for the on-site tasks of absorber removal, surface preparation, absorber installation, and performance testing. 
3) Proposals will be evaluated on the offeror’s recent performance on similar projects.  This evaluation factor will include the extent to which large initial RAM installation or RAM refurbishment projects have been completed or are currently underway, the number of such projects which have been performed in the past five (5) years, the extent to which the offeror’s products and workmanship met the customer’s technical requirements, the extent to which the offeror adheres to project schedules, and whether letters of recommendation and references were included in the proposal.
4) Proposals will be evaluated on the price proposed.

For CLINS 0002 though 0009, the Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror proposing the lowest price for the items that have been determined to comply with the requirements of the specifications and solicitation.  The proposal must demonstrate an understanding of the requirement and the ability to meet the specifications.
Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government’s best interests, the Government will evaluate the total price for the basic requirement together with any option(s) exercised at the time of award.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 
Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>Questions and Answers;</p>
<p>Question 1- the installation of this dryer requires a ventilation system similar to a domestic dryer. Is this already installed? <br /><br />Answer 1 - We already have a dryer in place, that makes the installation easier. The dryer is connected to a heavy duty safety switch (already in place) not your standard 110v outlet and the vent hole is already in place. We prefer the manufacture delivers it and installs it to honor NFPA compliance guarantee</p>

<DESC><p>Please review the following questions and responses:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Question:&nbsp; Are the state and local county checks only for those areas that have databases or do you want courier retrieval.&nbsp; If so,&nbsp;will the 24 hours be waived for those counties which will not return data that quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer:&nbsp; Companies should disclose if they have the capability to provide a single point of database for the State Criminal History Repository search.&nbsp; The companies may add on a processing fee for each State Criminal History Repository search conducted and the additonal user fee charge by each state.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Question:&nbsp; National criminal record database searches typically contain name and DOB information, but not social security number, leading to a lot of false positive information.&nbsp; What expectation does the government have that the vendor will validate information before returning results?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer:&nbsp; There are other data identifiers such as "Gender, Date of Birth and Place of Birth, Citizenship status, etc.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Question:&nbsp; How many locations/individuals will require access to the system:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer:&nbsp; Twelve(12) Regional Field Office locations nationwide, total approximately eighty (80) users.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Question:&nbsp; Does the vendor need to integrate into any existing software application?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer:&nbsp; No,but the system must be able to have the "website" capability for the Agency Users to gain access.&nbsp; There is no existing interface connectionwithin ICE "IT: structure.</p>

<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (JUNE 5, 2009)</p>
<p>Question 1: Maximum response time, contrast ratio and brightness was not addressed in the solicitation. Do we need to include these items in our quote?</p>
<p>Answer 1: These items were not included because they are not key items for an office automation display. The minimum specifications listed in the solicitation are critical features to our requirement. However, you are free to include these items in your quote, even though they are not required. To be technically acceptable, the Government requires that all of the minimum specifications be addressed.</p>
<p><br />Question 2: Brand name preference was not listed in the solicitation. Are we required to use a brand name?</p>
<p>Answer 2: We are not requiring a brand name for this solicitation. As long as the monitor meets the minimum specifications it is considered technically acceptable.</p>
<p>Question 3: Are items on the GSA schedule preferred?</p>
<p>Answer 3: No, there is no preference. This is an open market purchase order. Items do not need to be listed on a GSA schedule.</p>

GPS is an Acquisition Category ID program. GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC) 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC 14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>OCX will provide command, control, and mission support for the GPS Block II and III satellites as well as support to existing and new interfaces. OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.</p>
<p>This is a Phase B acquisition for OCX that is heavily dependent upon the Phase A work performed on contracts with Northrop Grumman and Raytheon resulting from solicitation number FA8807-07-R-0001. Work performed under the Phase B contract will include development of OCX Blocks 1.0 and 2.0. This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for up to five years.</p>
<p>The award decision for Phase B will be based in part upon an evaluation of the content from Phase A data deliverables including, but not limited to, Integrated Master Schedule, Software Development Plan, Software Architecture Description, Human Engineering Program Plan, Control Segment Transition Plan, System Engineering Management Plan, Segment and Software System Measurement Report, Facilities Plan, Integrated Support Plan, Risk Assessment Report; and a Modernized Capability Engineering Model (MCEM) Technical Demonstration. MCEM Technical Demonstration Instructions are available from the contracting POCs below. In addition, the Government will consider relevant past performance on the contracts awarded in response to solicitation number FA8807-09-R-0001.

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<p>Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), 8532 Marina Bay Dr., MacDill AFB, FL 33621, requires the purchase of two Internet Protocol Terminal acessory kits to replace items that were re-appropriated for mission spares. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to DataPath, Inc., 2450 Satellite Boulevard, Duluth, GA., 30096. Interested parties may e-mail Barbara Squitieri at barbara.squitieri@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, no later than Tuesday, 16 June 2009, 9:00 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by Tuesday, 16 Jun5 2009, 9:00 a.m. EST will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)<br />The Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), Deployable Joint Command and Control System currently has 71 functional SWE-DISH systems with accessory kits, and an additional 10 incomplete SWE-DISH systems without accessory kits. The SWE-DISH are the primary means of satellite communications at deployed JCSE locations, and the ones in-garrison are used for training. A sources sought was posted on FedBizOps for 4 days. No responses were received. As a result of this, it appears that DataPath is the only vendor who provides SWE-DISH satellite communications terminals, accessories and replacement parts. This was confirmed in an e-mail from SWE-DISH (see attached). The action being processed is for the purchase of two IPT accessory kits to make the SWE-DISH satellite terminals complete and operational.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Facilities Management & Engineering (FM&E) Tactical Infrastructure (TI) program has a requirement for Comprehensive Tactical Infrastructure Maintenance and Repair (CTIMR) for the majority of its physical fencing along the southwest border.  During the past 10 months, CBP has conducted market research and a series of industry days to better understand the industrial base, companies capable and interested in providing this support and what challenges may face them in doing so.

As a result of this work, and feedback provided by industry, a draft request for proposals (RFP) was posted on May 29, 2009, on the Federal Business Opportunity website.  In the draft RFP, we asked industry to provide CBP with another round of feedback.   Feedback provided during this phase of the procurement will allow CBP to further refine the acquisition strategy and business related requirements of the project prior to release of the final RFP in the July/August 2009 timeframe.

CBP has received feedback that instructions related to this process were difficult to find in the draft RFP.   To ensure transparency and awareness of these instructions, please note and refer to the following guidance in the draft RFP:

Section B, Page 4:   “At this time the Acquisition Plan (AP) for this acquisition has not been approved.  Small business capability statements have been reviewed and there are one or more small businesses who may be capable of performing in one or more of the areas of this acquisition.  Consideration of socioeconomic class of any potential set aside(s) are still being considered.  Small business is encouraged to respond to this draft as well as future notices.”

Section L.2 (c) (1), Page 74:  “Comments to this draft RFP shall be submitted upon issuance of this notice thru due date listed (in the SF33, i.e. June 16, 2009 emphasis added).  All questions and comments will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS for all interested vendors.”  

Please note that comments, questions, and suggestions related to the draft RFP are being accepted through June 16, 2009, 12 noon EST.  Comments can be emailed to CTIMR@cbp.dhs.gov. 

The Contract Specialist for this project is Yolanda Brown and she can be reached at CTIMR@cbp.dhs.gov or 202-344-2500.

<DESC>The Voluntary Safety Programs (VSP) Branch, AFS-230, is located at Dulles Airport. The contractor must provide AFS-230 with essential business process support for the Voluntary Disclosure Program (VDRP) and related Voluntary Safety Programs.  It also provides maintenance and development of associated automated systems.  Secondarily, it would provide business process support as required for FAA-internal management of related voluntary programs managed by AFS-230.  VDRP provides certificate holders, indirect air carriers, and production approval holders an avenue for avoiding civil penalties by disclosing safety issues to the FAA and taking corrective action to address those concerns.  The FAA believes that aviation safety is well served by providing incentives for organizations to identify and correct their own instances of regulatory noncompliance and to invest more resources in efforts to preclude their recurrence.  The FAA's policy of foregoing civil penalty actions when one of these entities detects violations, promptly discloses the violations to the FAA, and takes prompt action to ensure that the same or similar violations do not recur is designed to encourage compliance with the FAA's regulations, foster safe operating practices, and promote the development of internal evaluation programs.

SECTION C   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK

C.1 BACKGROUND

The 20th Century was a time of increased technological and societal change for the transportation planning community.  Innovations such as GIS, GPS, remote sensing, and ITS monitoring technology have provided the transportation professional and the general public a potential overwhelming wealth of information about personal travel, goods movement and system performance.  While rapid change in the field of transportation is not unprecedented, the increase in information and ability to analyze and display information may be.

At the same time, understanding and responding to transportation needs has become greater and more complex.  The transportation system in the United States continues to serve an increasing population and even faster increase in vehicle travel.  More areas have become urbanized and some of the fastest growing areas are in smaller urban areas.  Both personal trips and goods movements are more diverse in origin and destination, time of day, and purpose.  The transportation system serving these increasing needs is aging.  At the same time, there is increasing consideration of other societal goals in the development of transportation programs, from promoting environmental stewardship to incorporating local community involvement.

The role of transportation planning is changing to emphasize the movement of people and goods as well as environmental, social, economic, land development, and financial parameters of alternative futures.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is being asked to assist the transportation community in addressing these issues within a transportation schema. This is reflected in the FHWA research agenda – crosscutting and multi-disciplinary in response to the issues facing planners today.

Within this context, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), and closely related legislation such as the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) charge FHWA and transportation planning at all levels of government with meeting the complex demands of identifying and responding to future transportation needs. In particular, SAFETEA-LU promotes the assessment of multi-modal transportation needs and the analysis of the transportation, environmental, economic and social impacts of proposed investment and operational alternatives in support of decision-making.  Because of this, the research universe the FHWA operates in is fluid, dynamic, and flexible. To realize its research, development and technical assistance objectives, FHWA requires the support of multi-disciplined contractor teams to meet the challenges of transportation planning as we continue into the twenty-first century.

The ability to bring in stakeholders and specialists in various fields such as AASHTO, AMPO, NARC, TRB, NADO, NACO, APTA, CTAA, STPP, LTAP, TTAP, and UTC, public agencies, including those outside traditional transportation disciplines is of greater significance today than at any other time. The ability to retain flexible and responsive support, available at any time to research, assist, and answer the questions related to planning for a world class transportation system is of utmost importance.

C.2 CONTRACT OBJECTIVE

The indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity task order contracts resulting from this request for proposals are intended to give FHWA and its U.S. Department of Transportation partners the flexibility to address a number of issue areas without specifically identifying each required task for the life of the contract. The contract holders will be expected to provide a series of services as needed with a variety of transportation and other expertise brought to bear. They are expected to be able to organize resources to answer sophisticated research questions that will often be multifaceted and contentious in nature, and provide a broad range of support functions in multiple Task Areas.

The objective of this contract is to provide readily available support to the research program in eight Task Areas:
A.	Congestion 
B.	Safety Planning
C.	Security Planning
D.	Freight Planning
E.	State, Metropolitan, Rural, and Tribal Planning Capacity Building 
F.	National/International Planning
G.	Tools to Support Planning and Environment
H.	Program Management and Outreach
 
C.3 TECHNICAL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS

The contractors shall provide expertise in the major areas described above under the “Contract Objective.”  In addition, upon award of contract, FHWA shall be able to request up to 20,000 hours of effort per year from the contractor.  This work may be required to be conducted simultaneously in any, or all, of the major areas above, or simultaneously in a short time period (e.g. the 20,000 hours of effort could all be required in only six months of the year.)  The specific projects to be completed will be determined on an as needed basis by FHWA.

C.4 SCOPE OF WORK

This contract is designed to give FHWA and its contract partners the flexibility to examine a number of different task areas without specifically identifying each and every required task for the life of the contract. The contract holders will be expected to provide a series of services, as needed within the specified task areas.

C.5 TASK AREAS

For each program task area, proposals must demonstrate an understanding of the task and the technical issues involved, along with the experience and expertise required to address the issues. Examples of experience and expertise include, but are not limited to, research conducted, data collection and analysis in the subject area, technical assistance on the issues and modeling and model development. 

This section describes the specific task areas to be addressed and the technical skills necessary associated with each task area. Offeror’s must demonstrate an understanding of each task area and an ability to provide all functional capabilities for each technical area.

<a href="mailto:daniel.marcantonio@us.army.mil">TACOM - Warren Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>Introduction:<BR>The Family of Light Armored Vehicles (FOLAV) has been in the USMC inventory since 1983.  Since the initial fielding of the FOLAV there have been two major upgrades; the Service Life Extension Program LAV-A1 (SLEP) (1998-2002) and the LAV-A2 Survivability Upgrade (LAV A2 SU) (2006-2010).  While these upgrades extended the primary systems service life of the FOLAV through 2025, the upgrades did not address the variant specific subsystem mission suites on the LAV-ATA2.  Basic characteristics of the LAV platform are provided in Attachment 1 of this RFI.<BR><BR>The LAV-ATA2s subsystem mission suite has become difficult to support and several subcomponents are obsolete.  In fact, the M901A1 TOW has reached the point of ever increasing obsolescence limiting it to USMC inventory.  As part of additional service life extension and fleet upgrade efforts, PM-LAV is evaluating improvements to the turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system. The specific purpose of this program is to improve the supportability and mission effectiveness of the LAV-ATA2 by providing the following mission suite upgrades:<BR>1.	An Anti-Tank weapon station with:<BR><BR>"	Multiple reload, and rapid capability<BR>"	Ability to facilitate multiple target engagements in high intensive fights<BR>"	An effective platform for Elevated TOW Systems (ETS), and offers the LAR Battalion a precision long-range capability to destroy the enemy<BR>"	A second generation thermal sight and an advanced fire control system capable of firing the current and next generation heavy anti-armor missiles<BR>"	Improved reliability, availability, and maintainability<BR><BR>2.	Turret Trainers for the Operational Forces and float assets for each of the<BR>Maintenance Centers<BR><BR><BR>The following are specific objectives of this program:<BR><BR>"	Provide the LAV-AT mission suite upgrades initial operational capability by May 13, 2013 and full operational capability by August 3rd 2016<BR>"	Improve LAV-AT  readiness by greater than 10% and reduce the operational and support cost by greater than 5%<BR><BR>The deliverables/resultant products of this effort will be 115 LAV-AT modernized with the mission suite upgrades, nine LAV-AT Turret Trainers, two turrets float assets with all mission suite upgrades applied.  In addition meet all milestones and provide supporting documentation required per SECNAV Instruction 5000.2D (unless otherwise directed by MARCORPSYSCOM ACPROG authority).<BR><BR>It is anticipated that after receipt of information from the respondents of this RFI, the government will conduct a trade study followed by a downselect process to determine several leading turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system solution candidates that will undergo additional evaluation.  The evaluation will include ergonomic assessments, spaceclaim and mounting studies, human factors studies, modeling and simulation. Turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system samples may also be acquired for physical measurement, performance evaluations, and testing.  The proposed solutions will be evaluated against current and future mission profiles and the impact of the design on life cycle cost of the LAV system.  <BR>Specific areas of evaluation for the turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system trade study and downselect include these requirements (T = threshold / O = Objective):<BR>"	effectively acquire, engage, and destroy threat main battle tanks beyond the range of enemy tank main guns (T)								<BR>"	ability to destroy bunkers and concrete buildings that harbor threat (T)<BR>"	allow for search and target acquisition while stationary (T)			<BR>"	allow for search and target acquisition on the move (O)<BR>"	allow rapid transition from battlefield movement to target engagement (T)<BR>"	acquire targets, fire, and reload while under armor protection (T)<BR>"	acquire targets, fire, and reload from inside the vehicle (O)<BR>"	fire from a short halt (T)<BR>"	fire on the move (O)<BR>"	acquire, engage, and destroy the enemy with its main armament in a 3600 field of fire (T)<BR>"	acquire, engage, and destroy the enemy with its main armament, day or night, under obscured conditions of smoke, fog, haze and dust (T)<BR>"	store and fire a minimum of 2 ready rounds in launcher and minimum of 14 stored rounds  (T)<BR>"	store and fire a minimum of 4 ready rounds (O)<BR>"	capable of fire multiple missiles without reloading (T)<BR>"	have an automatic loader or have the capability of being retro-fit with an automatic loader (O)<BR>"	accommodate ground mounting when necessary (T)<BR>"	fire current and next generation USMC inventory heavy anti-armor missiles (T)<BR>"	provide fire and forget anti-tank weapon system capability (O)<BR>"	training commonality for current and next generation heavy anti-armor missiles (O)<BR>"	LAV-AT crew consists of four Marines (T)<BR>"	Full mission capability with three personnel (O)<BR>"	achieve a Probability of Hit of .75 at the maximum effective range of the weapon (T)<BR>"	achieve a Probability of Hit of .9 at the maximum effective range of the weapon (O)<BR>"	achieve compatibility with the LAV-AT secondary armament (M240E1, 7.62 mm machine gun pintle, with azimuth and elevation travel locks with a minimum 1800 arc traverse and accessible through the commanders hatch) (T)<BR>"	have degraded capability to permit targets to be acquired and destroyed when the main power and /or hydraulic system of the LAV-AT have failed (O)<BR>Responses should include descriptions of sustainment characteristics such as reliability Mean Miles Between Failures (MMBF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), commonality with other systems, and in theater sustainment.  Additional technical data will likely be requested from participating turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system manufacturers, including spaceclaim and interface drawings, prior test data, mass properties, and dynamic stiffness characteristics.  This information will be applied to the validated modeling and simulation environment.  Results of the evaluation will be shared with each potential supplier as may be appropriate. <BR><BR>If you are interested in participating in this LAV upgrade effort, please respond by completing the Attachment 2 questionnaire and send it to:<BR>Dan Marcantonio<BR>Procurement Analyst<BR>daniel.marcontonio@us.army.mil <BR>586-574-9062<BR><BR>Please feel free to include any additional product brochures, test results, technical data, etc. that you believe is relevant to the LAV application.<BR><BR>Thank you in advance for your help on our trade study for the LAV turret and heavy anti-armored weapon system and we look forward to continued discussion on this project. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY--In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Pub,L. 111-5, the Government posts this pre-solicitation announcement. (Recovery funding may or may not be utilized for potential future Task Orders).<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about June 18, 2009 on the FeedBizOps website at www.fbo.gov. RFP will be for two Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC) for Construction of Military Facilities and Infrastructure located at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri.   The MATOC pools will consist of up to five (5) contractors as follows:  Small Business MATOC - 3 contractors with a pool of $29.5M and a HubZone MATOC - 2 contractors with a pool of $20.0M.  If there are no responsive or responsible offeror(s) for the HubZone MATOC the $20.0M set-aside for this pool will be incorporated into the Small Business MATOC.<BR><BR>The general Scope of Work for this MATOC includes, but is not limited to: Design-Build and Design-Bid-Build Construction Work and Services, a broad range of military renovation and construction work, primarily for the Kansas City District, US Army Corps of Engineers, located at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri.  As requirements develop, Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for Task Orders will generally be issued on a Competitive Basis, however the Government may issue Task Orders on a sole source basis in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 16.505(b)(2). Task Orders will include primarily Military Construction (MILCON) or Operations and Maintenance (O&M) projects, but other authorized projects under the Support for Others program may also be accomplished under the said proposed contracts. Award of Competitive and/or Sole Source Task Orders will be based on either Best Value or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Offer. All orders shall be subject to negotiations to obtain a Fair and reasonable price. Delivery Orders will range from $20,000.00 to $10,000,000.00.  The Performance Periods for each of the Base MATOC Contracts shall be for Three (3) years.<BR>This acquisition is a coordinated requirement for a pool of MATOCS to include HUBZone and Small Business firms.  Total amount of both pools is $49.5M.  If the government is successful in awarding both pools, the HUBZone pool will be considered first with regard to task orders to be issued under the MATOC  if there are either no responses from the HUBZone firms or the pricing offered is unreasonable, then projects may be offered under the Small Business MATOC Pool.<BR><BR>The solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process. In Phase 1 interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute a MATOC contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than eight (8) to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  The Phase 1 Solicitation will be available on or about the week of 18 June 2009, and Proposals will be due on or about 20 July 2009 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  Typical projects may include design and construction of new, or renovated; administrative facilities, aircraft maintenance facilities, vehicle maintenance facilities, fencing, dormitories, family housing, hardstands/parking lots, utilities, drainage structures, demolitions, and site development.  Projects are likely to include complex mechanical, security systems, communications, HVAC & energy controls, and electrical upgrades for both interior and exterior systems.  Energy savings projects, including ground source heat pump systems for multiple facilities, to meet LEED certifications are likely to be included.  One project may include Security Dog housing and training facilities with small Vet clinic.  Security Force protection for setback and barriers may be required for some facilities.  Asbestos and Lead based paint remediation may be required for some renovation or demolition projects.  Hardstand construction may include aircraft apron or runway replacement. Projects may require short duration construction periods and proactive construction management to be successful.  Responding firms should demonstrate design and construction experience in a majority of these works to be considered highly qualified.   Past design and construction experience with similar type aircraft facilities and LEED are needed to be highly qualified.<BR><BR>Proposals received in response to the solicitation and will be evaluated in accordance with procedures outlined in FAR Part 15 for Best Value.   The solicitation will include a detailed list of Evaluation Factors, including any Subfactors or Elements, and will provide instructions for Proposal Requirements and the Basis for Award. The Phase II Solicitation will be available on or about the week of 27 July 2009, and final Proposals will be due on or about 10 August 2009. The issued solicitation(s), including any amendments, shall establish the official Opening and Closing Dates and Times. At this time, no Pre-Solicitation Conference is planned for this solicitation.

<DESC>1. Is there a requirement for hosting and support?<BR><BR> Not during the first Phase.<BR><BR>2. If there is not a hosting/support requirement, how will progress demonstration reviews and performance evaluations be conducted?  <BR><BR>The government team will review progress reports on a monthly basis and evaluate the system demonstration at the conclusion of the effort<BR><BR>3.  If there is a hosting/support requirement, will it be for the duration of the entire project or only for the duration of the environment evaluations? If so, what is the anticipated time period for the evaluation?<BR><BR>No hosting requirement during Phase I. <BR> <BR><BR>4. Will any hardware purchased become the property of the government if the proof of concept is approved?<BR><BR>Yes all hardware purchased will be the property of the goverment<BR> <BR><BR>5. Is it the contractor's responsibility to find evaluators for the VR environment or will the evaluators be determined by USAMRMC?<BR><BR>The evaluators will be determined by MRMC. <BR><BR>6. Is there a requirement for avatars to display amputee conditions, such as wheel chairs required, loss of limb, etc? Can you clarify the level of detail requested for the pilot program?<BR><BR> The level of detail should be dictated by the level of ability of the contractor. <BR><BR>7. If the contractor will be hosting, who will own and maintain the IP<BR>(Trademark) rights to the domain name that will be used to host this site?<BR><BR>To be determined.<BR> <BR>8. Will counselors and clinicians need to be available to participate in the evaluation phase for the proof of concept, or will their availability and contributions be simulated?  In other words, does the contractor need to provide counselors / clinicians who know the environment to be part of the evaluation?<BR><BR>Phase I will focus on the development of the virtual environment. Future phases could include further and more in depth evaluation.<BR> <BR>9. Will users with amputations be using the system as part of the evaluation?  If so, do we need to provide an adaptive interfaces?<BR><BR>Phase I will focus on the development of the virtual environment. Future phases could include further and more in depth evaluation.<BR><BR>Questions: <BR>With the solicitation, Paragraph 1.1.  Background states, This Request for Proposals seeks to determine the best Virtual Reality Environment (VR) capabilities to develop a best of breed proof of concept VR environment platform in which to support the year one effort of creating the infrastructure of an environment for amputee support groups. This effort will leverage the lessons learned from past efforts and demonstrate the extension of the virtual world environment into telemedicine and provide a standardized platform of tele-health constructs. This project will focus on the development of a support group environment for amputees and their families.  <BR>The paragraph above seems to outline four requirements.  <BR>1.	Develop, build and deploy a social networking website to support peer-to-peer networking, mutual support, information and tool to aid with rehabilitation, health services, career service, economic and family stability, etc., information exchange and communication between members.  <BR>2.	Conducting research, investigation and experimentation to determine the best Virtual Reality tools and environment. <BR>3.	Develop a proof of concept Virtual Reality environment. <BR>10.  Is this an accurate interpretation of the requirement? If not, what parts are accurate and what parts are not?  Please provide detailed clarifications.<BR>Yes, that is accurate. <BR>11.  Please provide details on the level of effort for the research phase to be conducted prior to developing the actual proof of concept.<BR>The offeror's technical/management approach must be sound and demonstrate that the contractor has a thorough understanding of virtual world environment development requirements. The offeror's plan should clearly address their capability to analyze, plan, and implement support in accordance with the stated requirements listed below. The offeror should include a discussion in their proposal that addresses the following requirements and their approach to each requirement:<BR>a. Controlled Access<BR>b. Expansion Capability<BR>c. Multi-location access<BR>d. Real time communication<BR>e. Multiple in-world geographical settings and Avatar movement among them <BR>f. Private patient/group treatment areas <BR>g. Public interaction areas <BR>h. Avatar Customization<BR> i. Capability for a standalone virtual world<BR> j. Ability for scene/session replay <BR>k. External application implementation within the VR environment<BR> l. Technical support and user guidance during evaluation of anew VR        	environment typical for the demands of new user involvement<BR> m. Ability for avatar movement, gestures, and actions modeled after real 	world behavior  <BR><BR>12.  Without knowing the results of the research, it is difficult to scope and price the proof of concept deliverable.  Please provide anticipated level of effort and scope as possible to enable development of a realistic bid submission.<BR>Phase I of the effort is solely to develop the virtual world platform and demonstrate the aforementioned requirements. <BR>Within the solicitation, the Requirements state: <BR>3.1. Develop a scalable multi-user, multi location Proof of Concept Virtual Environment platform that allows secure authorized anonymous access.<BR>13.   Assuming this requirement is looking to build or leverage existing technology which allows a user to interact with a computer-simulated environment, what type of simulation is envisioned? A simulated real world or an imaginary world.? <BR>This is to be determined by the contractor. <BR>14.  What type of user interface is envisioned?  Standard input devices such as a keyboard and mouse, or through multimodal devices such as a wired glove?<BR>This is to be determined by the contractor. <BR>15.   The solutions should seek to stimulate which senses?  Sight, sound?  <BR>This is to be determined by the contractor. <BR><BR>16:  Assuming users will make use of avatar in the virtual environment, how is it envisioned the users avatars will communicate?  Through text chatting or real time voice chat?<BR>It is required that the communication be both text chatting and voice chat. <BR>17: Is it envisoned that this will be a solution that will runs on a browser without any need to install special software?<BR><BR>18: Is the environment to be 2D or 3D? <BR>This is to be determined by the contractor. <BR><BR>What commercially deployed virtual reality envirmentent best demonstates the vision of the what the effort seeks to create, SecondLife.com, Military.com, Facebook.com, other?<BR>The virtual world environment should allow users to move their avatar among multiple locations. <BR>3.2. Provide an extensible standardized platform that will allow expansion and continued development of a robust VR environment.<BR>19:  How many users require for proof of concept VR environment? <BR>This proof of concept will only need to be demonstrated to the govt team. <BR><BR>20:  How many users if scaled to maximum estimated user population? <BR>This will not be determined in Phase I. <BR>21.  What kinds of tools are required within the virtual reality environment? <BR>a. Controlled Access<BR>b. Expansion Capability<BR>c. Multi-location access<BR>d. Real time communication<BR>e. Multiple in-world geographical settings and Avatar movement among them <BR>f. Private patient/group treatment areas<BR> g. Public interaction areas <BR>h. Avatar Customization <BR>i. Capability for a standalone virtual world<BR> j. Ability for scene/session replay<BR> k. External application implementation within the VR environment <BR>l. Technical support and user guidance during evaluation of anew VR 	environment typical for the demands of new user involvement<BR> m. Ability for avatar movement, gestures, and actions modeled after real 	world behavior  <BR>3.3. Provide real-time communication and collaboration through standard forms of information exchange.  <BR>22:  What kind of communication and collaboration tools?  Voice of IP, Video Teleconferencing, discussion boards, member profiles, blogging, other?<BR>This is to be determined by the contactor, but the minimum requirement is to allow voice and text real-time chat. <BR>23:  Please define and provide examples of standard forms of information exchange. <BR>Minimum requirement is to allow voice and text real-time chat. <BR>3.4. Provide capability for peer support groups to meet and interact within the virtual environment. <BR>24: Please define the type and level of sophistication of virtual environment you would like participants to be able to participate in virual peer support groups.  Does this require realtime group meetings?  For example, a discussion board would allow participants to interact virtually at the time and place of their choosing.  A video teleconference would require participants to have a webcam equipped computer to participate at a specific time.  A true virtual reality environment like SecondLife would employ the use of avatars, i.e. an online a movable three-dimensional image used to represent somebody in cyberspace.  Or, is there a mix of two or more of the above technologies? <BR>This is to be determined by the contractor. <BR><BR>3.5. Provide technical support and user guidance during evaluation of new VR environment typical for the demands of new user involvement. <BR>25: What level of technical support?  Helpdesk support via email within 24 hours of query? 24/7 Realtime support via chat? 800 phone call center? Other?<BR>This is to be determined by the contractor, however, this is more a focus for the evaluation and deployment phases <BR>26:  How is success in to be measured for each deliverable? What criteria for success? <BR>The contractor will need to ensure all requirements are met and these requirements will be evaluated by the technical team. Again, those requirement are:<BR>a. Controlled Access<BR>b. Expansion Capability<BR>c. Multi-location access<BR>d. Real time communication<BR>e. Multiple in-world geographical settings and Avatar movement among them<BR> f. Private patient/group treatment areas <BR>g. Public interaction areas<BR> h. Avatar Customization <BR>i. Capability for a standalone virtual world<BR> j. Ability for scene/session replay <BR>k. External application implementation within the VR environment <BR>l. Technical support and user guidance during evaluation of anew VR environment typical for the demands of new user involvement <BR>m. Ability for avatar movement, gestures, and actions modeled after real world behavior  <BR><BR>27.  Who (in addition to the amputees & their families) is the intended audience <BR>This is the main focus for this phase.<BR>28.:  What is the end goal / mission for this site (other than providing a VR for the audience)? <BR>The main goal is for it to be tested and fielded as a support network for amputees and their families. <BR><BR>29:  What are the portals security, domain and hosting requirements? <BR><BR>The environment must be secure, but the exact methodology of security and hosting requirements will be determined in future phases. <BR><BR>30:  Who will be given access and how will that be controlled?  <BR><BR>Amputees and their families. It is dependent on the contractor to determine how they can best secure the environment to their capabilities. <BR><BR>31  If verification of identity, status and eligibility is required and handled by the contractor to allow an individual to establish an account, will the contractor be given access to the appropriate database to execute verification?<BR><BR>This will be discussed in possible future phases. <BR>32: Will this be hosted on DOD servers in the .mil domain, DOD servers with .com domain, the contractors server with .mil domain, or contractors server with .com domain?<BR>This will be discussed in possible future phases. <BR>
