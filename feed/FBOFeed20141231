<SUBJECT>Outcome Performance Measure Development for Persons with Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC)
<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RFP-14-005
<RESPDATE>120514
<CONTACT>Jon J. Gottschalk, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014439456, Email jon.gottschalk@nih.gov - Yvette Brown, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 301 443-2696, Email Yvette.Brown@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to compete a requirement for Outcome Performance Measure Development for Persons with Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC).  This procurement is being competed under Full and Open Competition under FAR Part 15.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursable option type contract will be awarded for a one year base period of performance with a one year optional period beginning on or about July 22, 2015.<br /><br />
<p><strong>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop routine measurements of health outcomes for older adults living in the community with multiple chronic conditions, through validated patient-reported outcome measures of health, functional status and quality of life and to conduct research suitable for inclusion in materials to be submitted for quality measure endorsement by the National Quality Forum (NQF). The targeted care settings are ambulatory or delivery system level.</p>
<p>This project consists of two phases, each of which shall produce a report suitable for inclusion in a submission to the NQF for endorsement of a performance measure on health related quality of life for persons living with MCC. In this project, MCC should be defined consistent with DHHS (two or more conditions that last a year or more and require ongoing medical attention and/or limit activities of daily living), including at least 10 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population. The project reports shall address NQF's Measurement Evaluation Criteria for the proposed performance measure. The report shall address the criteria that are current as of the initiation of work, include the importance, scientific acceptability, feasibility, and usability of the study (at present they are dated November 2012 and are available online at http://www.qualityforum.org/docs/measure_evaluation_criteria.aspx). Phase 1 (Base) addresses Veterans Rand 12 (VR-12) while Phase 2 (Option) addresses Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29.  A strongly justified alternate proposal for a different measure for Phase 1 may be considered acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT REQUIRMENTS:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A.	Phase 1 (Base)</span></p>
<p>Phase 1 involves the analysis of existing data on health-related quality of life on persons with MCC during the first 12 month period. The Offeror shall propose a Patient Reported Outcome (PRO)-based performance measure, with a preference for the VR-12-item Health Survey, Short-Form 36 (SF-36) or Short-Form 12 (SF-12), and perform the following:</p>
<p>I.Construct the PRO performance measure by using average change or percentage improved over time (functional stability or functional gain). Specify how the PRO will be used to determine the numerator, the method for including persons with MCC in the denominator, and any exclusion. Present a strong justification for the choice and indicate why it is superior to potential alternative measures.</p>
<p>II.Refine the performance measure and conduct analyses in a sample of MCC patients from available data against the NQF criteria, for reliability, validity, and threats to validity. The analysis of threats to validity shall measure exclusions; missing data or poor response rate; case mix differences and risk adjustment; discrimination of performance.</p>
<p>III.Develop and refine risk adjustment of the performance measure using available data and modeling. Evaluate and compare random-effects and fixed-effects approaches. Examine model stability. Evaluate potential risk-adjustment considering potential patient factors: socio-demographic, dual status, comorbidity, disability, and other clinical factors. Consider current NQF guidance on use of socioeconomic status as an adjustment factor.</p>
<p>IV.Using the existing data and simulations, assess the potential for the performance measure to demonstrate differences between ambulatory practices; similarly assess the potential to demonstrate differences between health care systems. Consider variations in sample size and proxy response rates. Propose suggestions for future collection of PRO-Performance Measure data.</p>
<p>V.Prepare documents describing the work to be conducted in Phase 2 that can be submitted to obtain human subjects review/clearance and for NIH clinical exemption from OMB clearance (included in Base Period).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Source of Data for Phase 1:</span></p>
<p>For this phase, the Offeror shall specify and justify their proposed source of secondary data which is suitable for conducting the required analyses, and assure its availability. The Offeror shall provide sample size, disease ascertainment, outcome measures and a power calculation for the main analyses. Potential sources of available data for this phase include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1)The Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (http://www.hosonline.org/Content/Default.aspx) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</p>
<p>2)Health ABC (http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/ledb/healthabc/index.htm) available from the National Institute on Aging;</p>
<p>3)Linkage of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) with the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) known as SEER-MHOS and available from the National Cancer Institute;</p>
<p>4)Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) which is co-sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).</p>
<p>Currently, as part of the MHOS, Medicare Advantage (managed care) plans collect information on limited health outcome measures in older adults, including:</p>
<p>I.Proportion of patients with improved or maintained physical health over two years based on patient self-report to the VR-12-item Health Survey.</p>
<p>II.	Proportion of patients with improved or maintained mental health over two years based on patient self-report to the VR-12-item Health Survey.</p>
<p>These measures are reported to the public in aggregate and used by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide Medicare Advantage Organizations with quality bonus payments based on their performance compared to a benchmark. Currently these measures are reported for all adults (mostly above age 65 years) enrolled in Medicare Advantage health plans, a self-selected group of Medicare beneficiaries. Because the report covers a general older adult population, it is not known if disparities exist, and to what degree, in the quality of care provided specifically for older adults with MCC as measured by these outcomes. It is also unclear if there is variation in the magnitude of the disparity across health providers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B.	Phase 2 (Option)</span></p>
<p>Phase 2 involves the collection and analysis of data using the PROMIS-29 profile and other instruments from a sample of persons age 65 and over with MCC.  Many short forms developed by the PROMIS group for self-administration to patients have been tested for reliability, face validity (through focus groups, expert panels, cognitive interviewing), construct validity (convergent and discriminate validity) and differential item functioning testing. The PROMIS tools, in particular the PROMIS-29 Profile measure, have not been extensively tested in an adult population age 65 and over.  Testing of the PROMIS measures was done via the internet with a primarily healthy adult population. The sample size of older adults, particularly the very old (over age 80 years), was limited.  Additional research and analysis is necessary to test the validity of the PROMIS tools in an older adult population with multiple chronic conditions and advance toward a potential quality measure for outpatient care.</p>
<p><strong>REPORTS/DELIVERABLES:<br /><br /></strong>The Offeror shall be required to deliver/perform the following: 1) Monthly calls with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR); 2) Semi-Annual Progress Reports; 3) Draft and Final Reports and the end of each phase; 4) Draft data sets and manuscripts; 5) Overall Final Project Report.</p>
<p><br /><strong>OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990 with a size standard of $15.0 million.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS), on behalf of the Office of Inspector General (OIG), intends to sole source to:
<p><br />First DataBank, Inc.<br />500 E 96th Street, Suite 500<br />Indianapolis, IN 46240-3767</p>
<p>OIG seeks to obtain 12 months of access to drug pricing data, drug-to-drug interaction data, and therapeutic class data to help: (1) provide OIG's Office of Audit Services with accurate background information during audits; (2) assist OIG's Consolidated Data Analysis Center and Office of Audit Services staff members perform data analysis work related to identifying potentially hazardous and/or fraudulent medical prescribing practices; and (3) support Medicare fraud investigations, new referrals for possible investigations, and criminal and/or civil litigation.</p>
<p>First DataBank is uniquely qualified to provide this access because it has developed a National Drug Data File (NDDF) software license that provides suggested wholesale price and other pricing data for all drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The NDFF allows OIG to access modules that are critical to its data analysis work, including the Drug-Disease Contraindications Module, the Indications Module; the Geriatric Precautions Module; and the Medical Lexicon Module.</p>
<p>First DataBank is the sole provider and distributor of the NDFF; no other vendors are authorized to sell the NDFF license. First DataBank creates the data and also develops and maintains the NDFF data for each customer.</p>
<p>The NDFF license is needed because OIG currently has a subscription to the NDFF. The NDFF data supports active investigations, audits, and cases that often involve court-related litigation or jury trials. As a result, if OIG is required to produce its data analysis used in support of Government litigation, its access to NDFF must be consistent and uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Finally, OIG's use of the NDFF has resulted in knowledge and efficiency: (1) OIG database administrators have created the database structures required to store and access NDFF data and have established reliable and efficient procedures to load NDFF data into these structures; and (2) OIG data analysts have incorporated NDFF data elements into their existing analysis programs.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the same services may submit product information and a capabilities statement that speaks to the services OIG is seeking in this proposed acquisition. The email subject line must reference OIG146182. All responses are due by January 8, 2015, 2:00 PM Eastern Time and can be sent to Khristine Agnello at Khristine.Agnello@psc.hhs.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract base upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a Small <br> Business Set Aside solicitation for Repairs to the East and West Jetty of <br> Menemsha Creek Federal Navigation Project, Martha's Vineyard, MA. The <br> project is planned to be issued on or about August 25, 2014. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. <br> The work of this project consists of repairing both the east and west jetty at <br> the entrance of Menemsha Harbor which were damaged during Hurricane <br> Sandy. The Menemsha Creek Federal Navigation Project (FNP) is located on <br> the Northwestern side of Martha's Vineyard in Vineyard Sound approximately <br> 13 miles Southwest of Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and 38 miles East of Point <br> Judith, Rhode Island. The east and west jetty extend into Vineyard Sound <br> approximately 575 ft and 450 ft, respectively, and provide protection to <br> vessels transiting into Menemsha Creek FNP. <br> Specific work tasks are intended to reconstruct severely deteriorated areas of <br> the east and west jetty to authorized dimensions. These tasks include delivery <br> and installation of approximately 1,000 tons of 2-4 ton armor stone (in total) <br> to repair the jetties. New stone will replace displaced armor stone to fill in <br> existing gaps in the jetty. Repairs will require substantial moving and rehandling <br> of existing stones to obtain the required interlocking placement and <br> construction tolerances. It is expected that the contractor will have to acquire <br> stone off-island as no stone of the required dimensions is available local to the <br> project. <br> Due to the location of repairs and width of crest on each jetty it is expected <br> contractor will be required to work from marine plant at least a portion of the <br> time. Land access to both the east and west jetty is available. The completedrepairs will provide a crest width of 6 ft (west jetty) or 10 ft (east jetty) for each structure, and elevations ranging from of +7.1 ft to +12.1 ft Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW). The tide range between Mean Higher High Water <br> (MHHW) and MLLW is 3.14 feet. Construction is expected to last 4 to 6 <br> months and be completed between October 15, 2014 and May 31, 2015. <br> This is not a request for proposals at this time. The solicitation requirements <br> and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the <br> response date will be available on this date. No telephonic, <br> mailed, faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted. The <br> solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, <br> offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website <br> (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be <br> considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed <br> to the Contract Specialist at Raushanah.Muhammad@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>Notice Type:  Sources Sought <br>  <br> Contracting Office: Department of the Army, Army Contracting Command - Redstone, Building 5303 Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898-5000 <br>  <br> Subject: Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) and Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasure (ATIRCM) Hardware; System Engineering, Technical, and Logistic Support Services <br>  <br> Synopsis:  This announcement is a Sources Sought (SS)/Request for Information (RFI) for market research.  Information is to be used for preliminary planning purposes in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to solicit or award a contract now or in the future.  No solicitation is available at this time, nor is there an estimated date of solicitation release at this time.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue an RFP at some future date, another notice will be published. <br>  <br> The Program Management Office -Aircraft Survivability Equipment (PMO ASE)  is seeking sources and information for a Common Missile Warning System (CMWS), AN/AAR-57, and an Advanced Threat Infrared Countermeasure (ATIRCM) System, AN/ALQ-212, spares, and engineering and technical services to include contractor logistic support programs. The PMO ASE is anticipating a limited/minimal CMWS systems/spares production program, technical services, engineering support, and logistics services for both CMWS & ATIRCM over the next 5 years.  ATIRCM services will be required upon the receipt of valid services requirements.  The CMWS systems shall be installed on rotary and fixed-wing aircraft to detect the launch and flight of Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) and provide audible and visual warnings to the aircrew.   <br>  <br> The CMWS must be integrated to meet the flight and operational environment requirements of the DOD's rotary wing aircraft such as UH/MH-60. CH/MH-47 & AH-64A/D.  No changes to existing configurations will be permitted.  System integrity shall be maintained. The CMWS must be integrated to meet the flight and operational environment requirements of fixed-wing aircraft, such as RC-12, C-12 & UC-35.  The CMWS includes the Improved Countermeasure Dispenser (ICMD) that activates expendables to provide the missile countermeasures.  The ICMD shall have the capability to monitor munitions firings upon a system or manual cue. The ICMD is capable of being loaded with, and dispensing three or more types of expendables, such as flares, chaff and smoke/aerosols.  The CMWS shall be composed of the following components; an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) supporting up to 6 Electro Optical Missile Sensors (EOMS) and up to 4 ICMDs where an ICMD is defined as 1 sequencer and 2 smart dispenser payload modules.  The ATIRCM shall be used in-conjunction with CMWS, and consist of (2) IR-Jam Heads, (2) MBL IR-Jam Lasers (2) Optical Couplers and (2) Jam Head Control Units used on the CH-47D/F aircraft.   <br>  <br> The CMWS shall maintain established interfaces with the UH/MH/HH-60, CH/MH-47, AH-64, RC/UC/C-12 and UC-35 aircrafts and do not require unique configurations, or software loads, for installation on aircraft of the same type.  The systems must be fully compatible and interoperable with existing systems without any changes to system configurations.  Interested sources must be able to provide Form, Fit and Functional equivalent Shop Replaceable Units (SRU) spares for the AN/AAR-57's already fielded to the DOD.   The engineering service is anticipated to include, engineering study and analysis, advanced IR missile jam code development, system software development and sustainment, logistics, system integration and installation, and testing support services.  The effort is envisioned to provide support for all CMWS systems already fielded as well as CMWS systems that will be produced within the follow-on production contract.  The interested source shall support a Contractor Logistic Support effort involving Field Service Representation, Engineering support, Documentation and Training support, Deployment support, Depot Repair and Maintenance of the AN/ALQ-212(V), and the AN/AAR-57(V) during the same time period of the spares production contract, potentially supporting a total of approximately 2400 CMWS and 83 ATIRCM in the field concurrently. <br>  <br> The Government does not possess a verified and validated Technical Data Package for the AN/AAR-57 or the AN/ALQ-212, suitable for competition at this time.  Any interested sources shall be required to provide written details of their experience with the similar systems technology, details of complex equivalent production capabilities meeting that of the anticipated quantities.  <br>  <br> The CMWS is considered critical mission-essential equipment used abroad by all rotary-wing and most fixed-wing aircraft.  It is the core element of the Suite of Integrated Infrared Countermeasures (SIIRCM) concept and is a U.S. Army Acquisition Category 1 (ACAT 1) Program.  The CMWS Program is satisfying the Army's requirements for enhanced aircraft survivability against Infrared (IR) guided threat missile systems.  The CMWS is the Aviation infrared survivability capability provider for the Future Force.  It will also complement, supplement and interface with other Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) to provide broad-spectrum platform protection.  Enhancements will continue to significantly reduce aircraft and aircrew casualties and permit extended operations within battle space environments populated with threat missiles.  The CMWS configurations vary by platform; currently, there are 12 system versions.   <br>  <br> The CMWS performs missile detection and classification, false alarm rejection, and missile declaration functions.  The CMWS also sends a missile alert signal to on-board avionics and other ASE.  In turn, visual and aural warnings to the aircrew are provided by on-board avionics systems.  Commands are issued to dispenser systems to eject decoys to provide for expendable countermeasures against an incoming infrared missile.  Each Electro-Optic Missile Sensor (EOMS) collects in-band electromagnetic radiation, converts it to electrical signals, and supplies these signals to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU).  The ECU analyzes this data to determine the existence of a missile threat.  If a threat exists, the ECU transmits missile threat messages to the APR-39 for further processing, threat display, and audio cueing or the ECU transmits audio directly to the Inter-Communications System (ICS) and displays the threat via the Control Indicator (CI) or Multi-Function Display (MFD).  Both the visual and aural indications provide threat type and relative position information to the pilots.  If the ECU determines that a missile launch has occurred, it supplies a command signal to the sequencers.  The sequencers process the Dispense Command Signal and sends a flare launch command to the dispensers, firing a flare solution.  Providing the CMWS is armed, a flare solution will dispense automatically in an attempt to counter the incoming missile associated with that interaction.  The Digital Control Display Unit (DCDU) for CI, located in the cockpit, provides both the pilot and co-pilot with interface to the CMWS.

<p>Installation Description</p>
<p>U.S. Army Garrison-Hawaii (USAG-HI) is responsible for all of the U.S. Army installations located on Oahu and the Big Island of Hawaii, which includes three fixed-wing airfields, 22 helipads and six major training areas over nearly 200,000 acres. USAG-HI supports the needs of service members from the Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, Hawaii Army National Guard, Hawaii Air National Guard, and Reserves. USAG-HI is headquartered at Wheeler Army Airfield, which is approximately 20 miles from the state capital of Honolulu.</p>
<p>USAG-HI is considering the potential privatization of the electrical distribution systems serving Schofield Barracks - Main Post, Wheeler Army Airfield, Schofield Barracks - East Range, Pililaau Army Recreation Center, Fort Shafter, Tripler Army Medical Center, Fort DeRussy, Helemano Military Reservation, Kahuku Training Area, Dillingham Military Reservation, Aliamanu Military Reservation, and Makua Valley Training Area. The USAG-HI electrical distribution systems to be privatized under this solicitation include the housing portions of the electrical distribution systems.</p>
<p>USAG-HI has more than 24,000 service members (active, reserve, guard), 12,000 civilian workers, and supports more than 28,000 retirees and more than 32,000 family members living both on and off base. The Garrison's day-time population is estimated to include nearly 100,000 active duty military personnel, civilians, family members and retirees across 22 military installations and training areas.</p>
<p>Additional information is available at: http://www.garrison.hawaii.army.mil/</p>
<p>Secure Documents</p>
<p>If sufficient interest is identified and this requirement proceeds in a competitive action, several of the solicitation documents will be posted as "secured" on the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") website. In order to view those documents, vendors will need to obtain special access. The process of obtaining access is somewhat lengthy, therefore all interested vendors are encouraged to begin that process as soon as possible. Instructions for obtaining access are provided below.</p>
<p>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:</p>
<p>1. Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. For assistance with SAM, please contact the SAM help desk. Contact information is available at https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p>2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in. Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system. For assistance with FBO, please consult the FBO Vendor Guide, which is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf.</p>
<p>3. After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:</p>
<p>a) Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. The DD2345 is also available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf. <br />b) Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form.<br />c) JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date. Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.<br />d) For assistance with the DD2345, or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS. Contact information is available at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/team.aspx. DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br />e) Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk. Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.<br /><br />a) The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br />b) The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

<DESC>This acquisition will not be set aside for small business consideration. This acquisition is a sole source. <br /><br />This is a synopsis in accordance with the format in Subpart 5.207, for server core additions, perpetual licenses for Gotham/Falcon software, annual support and maintenance services, and development of new features and the additions of new data sets.
<p>The Period of Performance (POP) of this contract will entail the completion of the migration of Telecommunications Linking System (TLS) to FALCON. Additionally, the POP will entail the completion of significant enhancements and new features to FALCON-DARTTS. The&nbsp;base&nbsp;period&nbsp;and Option Years 1-2 of this contract will entail the integration of 15 other, smaller data sets.<br /><br />Executive Steering Committee will propose five outcomes at the beginning of each contract year.&nbsp; These five outcomes are Major System Changes which requires 24 server cores. These newly added data sets may reside within the ICE Big Data Environment or may be ingested within the FALCON system itself. Palantir Technologies will ensure that these data sets, if not directly ingested within the FALCON system, can be remotely accessed and searched by users of the FALCON system, and that end users will not experience any significant degradation of performance while searching/manipulating data accessed remotely versus searching/manipulating data ingested directly into the FALCON system. There will&nbsp;be approximately&nbsp;15 additional data sets.<br /><br />The period of performance for this acquisition is one (1) 12-month base period with two (2) 12-month option periods.<br />Base Period = 03/14/2015 - 03/13/2016<br />Option Period 1 = 03/14/2016 - 03/13/2017<br />Option Period 2 = 03/14/2017-03/13/2018<br />Option Period 3 = 03/14/2018 - 9/13/2018</p>

<p>DHS Infrastructure Security Compliance Division (ISCD) is seeking to procure the services of a contractor that can undertake all phases of a comprehensive needs analysis and to analyze the data to develop a training program that is in alignment with the overall organizational mission, core values, and strategic goals. The Training Program must be a structured approach to career development that effectively supports employee development needs at all career and experience levels. The program will encompass a broad range of learning and development opportunities, tools, services, and resources.</p>
<p>To effectively accomplish this requirement, the following tasks are required:</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct a comprehensive needs analysis to include but not limited to Planning, Data Collection and Analysis, and Reporting.<br />&bull; Analyze employee training needs and potential changes in policy and regulatory guidance to create or update existing curriculum. <br />&bull; Review and evaluate existing curricula and documentation including existing instructional strategies, learning objectives, career series and grade levels and available content to develop a training methodology and strategy.<br />&bull; Design, develop, and deliver instructional content for all ISCD employees (based on roles, competencies, and learning objectives).

<p>ISCD may request expertise in the rapid analysis of the organizational structure of ISCD, collected data, and appropriate training strategies to provide comprehensive recommendations, and implementation support along with consulting services.</p>
<p>General Requirements: The expected benefits of the services provided to ISCD will be based on the contractor(s)' ability to support and meet unique, comprehensive training needs, in addition, the services will benefit ISCD by enabling the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Strategic approach to identifying employee training needs and the development of a robust training program.</p>
<p>&bull; The contractor shall provide Qualified Personnel<br />o Subject Matter Experts in Instructional Design<br />&#61607; The contractor shall maintain the personnel, organization, and administrative control necessary to ensure that the work delivered meets the governments' specifications and requirements.<br />&#61607; The work history of each contractor employee must contain experience directly related to the work required to perform under this contract.<br />&#61607; In addition, the contractor must have the demonstrated ability to reach out to a wide variety of subject matter experts in relevant fields, retain their services, and productively engage them in support of government requirements.

<p>2.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The ISCD was implemented in response to the DHS Appropriations Act of 2007 (Public Law 109-295), which provided DHS with the authority to regulate chemical facilities that present a high level of security risk with priority on highest risk facilities. In accordance with the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS), 6 CFR Part 27, ISCD's primary role is to assess the national risks of terrorist attacks on chemical facilities and resulting interdependent impacts (economic, mission, and public health effects) of such attacks towards managing the reduction of chemical facility security risks.<br />The ability for ISCD to correctly accomplish its mission relies in great part on a well-designed, executed, and measured training program that will build and retain a high-performing workforce. ISCD is responsible for ensuring all personnel receive and maintain the appropriate level and scope of mission-specific and job-specific training in support of the CFATS implementation. Training for all employees will be conducted through a strategic and collaborative developed curriculum and implemented using various best practice training solutions.</p>
<p>3.0 REQUESTED INFORMATION</p>
<p>&bull; Comprehensive knowledge of techniques and processes of conducting a comprehensive needs analysis. <br />&bull; Knowledge of federal career fields, job series and required job tasks<br />&bull; Knowledge and proven experience with instructional systems design<br />&bull; Comprehensive knowledge of techniques and philosophies of adult learning principles<br />&bull; Skill in designing and developing a robust training program<br />&bull; Skill in applying analytical methods and evaluative techniques to measure and evaluate training programs<br />&bull; Experience with compiling and assembling training data for reporting purposes<br />&bull; Ability to communicate effectively orally and in writing</p>

SUBMITTER'S ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO CAREFULLY MARK PROPRIETARY DATA IN RESPONSE TO THE RFI, SO THAT DHS REVIEWERS CAN ENSURE PROPER HANDLING.</p>
<p>5.0 INDUSTRY DISCUSSIONS</p>

<DESC>Summary:<br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in January.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for January is January 1, 2015 to January 7, 2015, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through FY 2015 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2014, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2015 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   ** You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP.  Your previous offered space will not be copied.<br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within the following boundaries:  Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties, also to include the City of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC><p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is requesting information and conducting market research to establish a Catalog of Assessments and Testing System. <br />It is important to note responses to this RFI are solely for the purpose of market research. Neither do they constitute pre-competition nor will they be evaluated in any way. Likewise, this RFI does not represent an official Acquisition Plan, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to any course of action in the future. This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning, and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement; no basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this notice or Government use of any information provided. The Government does not intend to award a contract based solely on responses to this RFI; nor will the Government pay for information solicited hereunder.<br />Each respondent, by submitting a Response, agrees that any cost incurred by it in responding to this request or in support of activities associated with this RFI shall be the sole responsibility of respondent. The Government shall incur no obligations or liabilities whatsoever, to anyone, for any costs or expenses incurred by the respondent in responding to this RFI.<br /><br />Responses:<br /><br />Interested parties are requested to provide a written summary of their Capabilities Statement, which shall also include and address the questions outlined in the attached Capabilities Questionnaire.<br />The Statement of Work (SOW) in its current form provides respondents the minimum requirements of the TSA. It is TSA's intent to use information gathered in response to this Notice to 1) assist in its market research to determine whether to, in accordance with applicable laws, set-aside, or solicit offers from all responsible sources, and 2) to gather information on commercial items/solutions available in the market place to create, deliver, administer, and manage assessments for TSA's workforce positions, as required. The system will be used by TSA to evaluate candidates and incumbents within a variety of positions including Transportation Security Officers (TSOs); Screening Partnership Program (SPP) screeners; Federal Air Marshals (FAMs); management, administrative, and professional (MAP) positions; and executive positions. These positions will be in a variety of business, technical, and security operations-related disciplines at the entry-level, team lead, first-line supervisor, manager, and executive levels. The contractor shall also perform certification tests for TSA's current TSO workforce including both online and offline capabilities each year. The overall web-based solution shall be capable of providing both pre-hire assessments and post-hire job skills assessments. <br /><br />Furthermore, the responses obtained will assist TSA with ensuring any final requirement is clearly defined to mitigate potential cost, schedule, and performance risk. The Government believes industry feedback is important and is receptive to questions or comments from industry highlighting potential technical problem areas associated with this effort. The SOW describes current contemplated possible scope of services and may vary from the work scope if a final&nbsp;Statement of Work or Performance Work Statement&nbsp;is solicited. <br /><br />TSA's objective is to provide industry with an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the CATS requirements. To assist TSA with identifying potential sources that possess the specific expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements of the SOW, the attached Capabilities Questionnaire has been developed. Respondents to this notice shall provide a written capabilities statement, which includes and addresses the questions outlined in the questionnaire, and any relevant information that specifically addresses the company's capabilities to provide the services outlined. Capabilities Statements shall be no longer than 15 pages (not including price estimate).<br /><br />It is particularly important for the TSA to understand the cost model for an entity to provide the support described in the SOW. Therefore, respondents are encouraged to provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) for the requirements described.<br /><br />Only electronic submissions will be accepted via email. Electronic files larger than 5MB shall be broken down into multiple files with no one file exceeding 5 MB. Each electronic submission shall include:<br /><br />&bull; RFI number HSTS01-15-I-HRM015 and "Capability Questionnaire Responses" in the Subject Line<br /><br />In the body of the email, include a vendor Point of Contact (POC), phone number and email address of the person to be contacted regarding any correspondence between the Government and the Vendor. This person should be a primary contact and capable of addressing questions or issues associated with the submission and content of the Capability Questionnaire.<br /><br />The deadline for responses is 4:00PM, local Washington DC time on or before January 22, 2015<br /><br />Respondents must submit their information in electronic versions to Mr. Victor Carden via e-mail at victor.carden@tsa.dhs.gov in either read-only Microsoft Word 2010 or Adobe Acrobat 9.0 PDF format.<br /><br />The Government does not intend to respond to vendor submissions, however, reserves the right to schedule one-on-one meetings with vendors to discuss information provided in response to this RFI.&nbsp; To aid TSA, please segregate and mark proprietary information. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARY MARKED. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 811219 for an upcoming requirement for the Central Mineral and Environmental Resources Science Center at the Federal Center in Denver, CO for maintenance services for JEOL scanning electron microscope model number JSM-5800LV CLD and model number JXA-8900 scanning microprobe. The offeror must have JEOL factory trained and authorized service engineers with current and specified training for these microscope models that can respond to on-site service calls within 24 hours. There shall be a minimum of two factory trained and authorized service engineers with specific training for the JOEL JXA 8900 Electron Microprobe and the JOEL JSM-5800LV CLD as well as other factory trained engineers that can be brought in if the primary service engineers are unavailable to meet critical response times. Response time for on-site service calls shall be within 24 hours. A preventive maintenance (PM) shall be performed on both pieces of equipment at least twice per contract year and prices shall include all consumable parts for PM service performed. It is critical that the successful offeror have immediate access to JEOL replacement parts for these models, due to the equipment&iquest;s criticality to the USGS geologic discipline mission. Performance and repairs, including part replacments, must be completed within 2 business days of a service call that cannot be resolved with telephone support, with a requirement of zero down time for the instruments. The successful offeror shall provide telephone support for repair and maintenance Monday through Friday 8:30 AM to 5 PM, MST, except holidays. The offeror must also have authorization for direct communication with the JEOL manufacturer in Japan for issues such as software maintenance and software upgrades and perform upgrades/updates as deemed necessary by the equipment manufacturer. <br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary.
<p>Project Description: The USGS maintains and operates a JEOL model number 5800-LV scanning electron microscope and JEOL model number JXA-8900 electron microprobe located in the Denver Microbeam Laboratory, Building 20, Denver Federal Center. The instruments provide critical analytical research data for geologic discipline programs. The instruments also provide data for USGS and other federal agency (OFA) clients. The two fully automated instruments operate daily, overnight and weekends. The JEOL 5800-LV scanning electron microscope and JEOL JXA-8900 electron microprobe are often scheduled weeks to months in advance including scheduling for out of town researchers who travel to Denver specifically to use these instruments. The instruments are both comprised of several critical subsystems including an electron optical column, an electronics console, PC, and a variety of data output devices. The JEOL 5800-LV scanning electron microscope and JEOL JXA-8900 electron microprobe must be maintained in full operating condition and to the manufacturer&iquest;s specifications at all times. This is necessary because of the strict scientific requirements of Mission area scientists as well as the Mission Area&iquest;s obligations to OFA clients. In order to meet these requirements, a full service contract for instrument preventative maintenance and repair is critical. The instruments must be maintained with highest priority service by JEOL factory trained, authorized service personnel in order to ensure proper maintenance and repair and to prevent damage to the instruments. <br />A scope of work will be provided with any solicitation that may be issued. The Government is not required to issue a solicitation.</p>

immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
	VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
	a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance
or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in
performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall
not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause
expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data
- General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the
contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure
VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling
must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure
that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization
requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and
subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties,
and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive
requirements.
c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not
destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of

behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives
and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records
and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures,
applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media
Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above
have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the
contract.
d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use,
disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and
applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and
policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies
become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the
contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after
execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the
information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as
authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic
information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case
any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to
an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is
complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for
cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated
and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business
Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information,
there is no business associate relationship.
h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information

immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other
requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately
refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA
sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the
contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on
a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system). Such
issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, but in no event longer than ____ days.
k. When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS
patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to the VA that the patch has
been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days. When the vendor is
responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes
within ____ days.
l. All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely
manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure. Exceptions to this
paragraph (e.g. for the convenience of VA) shall only be granted with approval of the
contracting officer and the VA Assistant Secretary for Office of Information and Technology.
INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
a. For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA
at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for
ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and
privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments,
routine vulnerability scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the
completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The contractor's security
control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A
Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA
Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network
involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.
b. Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of
Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in
place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the
information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be
assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or
inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior
to the collection of PII.
c. Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or
network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires
certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance
with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification
Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment)
contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums
of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types
are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems
connected to VA networks.
d. The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST
standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update
the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA
contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process. The
contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial
actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices,
and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the
timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to
periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector
General. The physical security aspects associated with contractor/subcontractor activities
must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may
affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be
reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing
and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The
Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.
e. The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems
and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment
must be provided to the COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an
assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor. The
contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the
contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no
additional cost.
f. VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor owned equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to
fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or
contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must
be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the
equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV)
software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and
patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral
software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.
g. All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment
that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA
Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the
contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any
person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard
drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that
contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the
contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1
requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.
h. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives,
optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end
of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
(2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in
place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement
cost at time of purchase.
 (4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software
associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard
drive, then;
(a) The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned
physically intact; and
(b) Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to	patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.
(c) A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed.
The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in
unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action
that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify
the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any
known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive
information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has
access.
b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's
notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident
(including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or
compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is
deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have
known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify
the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the
executed business associate agreement.
d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor
must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of
jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its
employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law
enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible
criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall
cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other
compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive
relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§5725, a contract may require access to
sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in
the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor
processes or maintains under this contract.
b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set
forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must
secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk
analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for
the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The
term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other
than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal
information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the
confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity
performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and
grounds for contract termination.
c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach,
including the following:
(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
(2) Description of the event, including:
(a) date of occurrence;
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the
degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised
(made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
 (8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and
Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating
the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been
compromised.
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be
responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $______ per affected
individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals
consisting of the following:
(1) Notification;
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(3) Data breach analysis;
(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and
credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit
records, histories, or financial affairs.
SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to
evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor
under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request
of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored
security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored,
or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA,
including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a
security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as
determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

The supplies are very specific to the surgical procedure being performed and are what is required for MOR to satisfy its mission at NMCP. Any deviation from the specifications of these products will increase risk to the patient and is unacceptable to the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with EOM Offshore LLC for four (4) 50-foot Ethernet-capable hoses/cables for mooring buoys for the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, MI.
<p><br />The hoses/cables shall have the following specifications:<br />&bull; Shall have eight #22 gauge conductive wires for use with data transfer and power transfer on each end of the cable<br />&bull; Shall be able to stretch 2.5 times its length<br />&bull; Shall have four unshielded twisted pairs for Ethernet speed capability<br />&bull; Shall have mechanical flanges to mate the top and bottom end of the mooring cable to allow for connection to surface buoy and bottom weight/instrument package<br />&bull; Shall be in 50 foot length<br />&bull; Shall have four #24AWG unshielded twist pairs<br />&bull; Shall be shipped in secure prefabricated wooden or plastic container<br />This is a 50-foot stretch hose with two flange adapters. This is a bungee-like cord with electrical wires coiled inside and designed to moor meteorological buoys and allow information and power to be transferred from the top of the buoy to instruments down below. Cables shall be attached to an internally designed meteorological buoy (1.4 meters in size), connecting a conductivity, temperature and depth instrument and video feed, along with acoustic sensors and fish finders, providing the ability to monitor below and have flexibility with the data gathered. This method is much safer than the previous chain mooring methods, which put the scientist in harm's way dealing with rapidly descending chain.<br />The reinforced rubber stretch hose was developed for mooring systems that require a stable platform for sensors or acoustics. It can stretch to two and a half times its original length and serves as a highly effective and robust mechanical isolator between the surface buoy and the quiet lower mooring section.<br />The cable shall have eight -#22 gage conductive wires for use with data transfer and power transfer and four #24 unshielded twisted pairs for Ethernet speed capability. These specifications are due to having two separate cable types, Ethernet (CAT 5) and copper (data and power). This is not a common design or demand.<br />The hose construction makes use of elastomeric-synthetic composite technology for elasticity and strength and also has eight number 22AWG conductors and four 24AWG twisted pairs built into it to allow signals and power to be transmitted along its length. All mooring connections are bolted flanges to minimize other sources of mechanical noise and to enable a modular approach to mooring design.<br />A 50-foot cable is required in order to reach 125-foot depths within the Great Lakes.<br />At this time there are no other known vendors that supply this type of mooring. EOM Offshore is a company spawned from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and have developed this method of mooring buoys/instrumentation and coupling them to seabed instrumentation.</p>

However, firms that believe they can provide the hoses/cables may submit substantiating documentation in writing within ten days of this notice.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition for its Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) for Operating and Computing Environment (OCE) for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA). Accordingly, the TSA intends to award a 9 month interim bridge contract to InfoZen, Inc., located at 6700 A Rockledge Drive, Suite 300, Bethesda, MD.
<p>This new interim bridge contract will allow for the continuation of services and will continue to address the requirements of the OIA for the deployment, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a broad range of transportation vetting programs designed to protect the U.S. Transportation system against terrorism and threats to National Security. In general, vetting is described as the thorough examination or investigation of the behaviors, connections, sympathies, associations, and conveyances of persons, goods, things, and entities to identify explicit and implicit associations for suitability and reliability for a particular activity that requires a high degree of trust or loyalty.</p>
<p>This interim bridge contract will also continue to provide continuous, uninterrupted service of manufacturer hardware and software renewal maintenance support for the OIA Operations and Maintenance of the Operating and Computing Environment (OIA/OCE) at TSA HQ, Colorado Springs, CO and Annapolis Junction, MD.</p>
<p>This interim bridge contract will provide a base period of performance of 100 days and one (1) six-month option period to support the continuous, uninterrupted service to the OIA OCE beginning December 16, 2014 through September 15, 2015 (if option is exercised). The estimated ceiling costs for this interim bridge contract is approximately $11,654,157.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. All responses received within four (4) calendar days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed interim bridge contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above named company directly.</p>

<CONTACT>Brian Klug, 917-790-8176

<a href="mailto:brian.klug@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New York</a>
<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract to Transystems, 2400 Pershing St., Suite 400, Kansas City, MO, 64108. This sole source Service contract is required for historic preservation review and impact assessment of in-field construction modifications to project plans and specifications; consultation with approved parties and review of construction contract submittals to ensure compliance with previously approved historic preservation assessments; for work on infrastructure in New York City . <br>  <br> Under the previous task orders Transystems was tasked to review all engineering reports and design submittals (Preliminary Assessments, 10%, 30%, 60%, 90%) up to the 100% submittal for each construction element.  Transystems reviewed 16+ design submittals, provided an assessment of historic preservation impacts from proposed designs and provided modifications to limit such impacts.  Transystems attended all meetings with Project Delivery Team and with reviewing agency officials.  The project is now in the construction phase.  Design changes and in -field modifications to previously approved plans and specifications must be reviewed for potential historic preservation impacts.  Also required is review of qualifications for certain construction contract personnel as per historic preservation agreements and approval of material samples specified to minimize historic preservation impacts.   Transystems will provide rapid and critical support throughout the construction phase. <br>  <br> Transystems was previously approved to participate in the review process as per an agreement with Federal, State and Local agencies.  Transystems has become intimately familiar with the issues related to the historic preservation issues on this project.  To bring in a new firm at this stage would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government as the new firm has to review work that has been on-going since 2004.  Integrating a new firm at this stage in the project will bring unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. <br>  <br> Transystems will not perform work for any other project or program under this specific contract action. <br>  <br> This is NOT a request for proposals or quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Firms intending to provide submittals must submit detailed information indicating their ability to meet the Government requirements.

<DESC>GSA is in the process of transitioning to one Multiple Award Schedule for Professional Services, which is anticipated to occur in mid to late 2015.  The new Schedule will be based on the existing platform for the Consolidated Schedule under the solicitation FCO00CORP0000C, which includes all the Special Item Numbers contained in this solicitation.  GSA requests that vendors submit offers for professional services under the Consolidated Schedule solicitation rather than this Schedule solicitation, in order to avoid any potential system or administrative issues that may accompany the transition to the new Schedule.

The General Services Administration is issuing Refresh 25 to Solicitation Number FCXB-F4-020002-B for Schedule 520 - Financial and Business Solutions. This solicitation was originally synopsized on April 1, 2002, under FCXB-F4-020002-N. Resultant contracts will be indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), multiple award schedule (MAS) contracts under the Federal Supply Schedules program. Contracts awarded under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award and lasting for five years unless cancelled or terminated. The award also includes three five-year option periods.

The scope of services includes the following Special Item Numbers (SINs):
520 1 Program Financial Advisor, 520 2 Transaction Specialist, 520 3 Due Diligence & Support Services, 520 4 Debt Collection, 520 5 Loan Servicing & Asset Management, 520 6 Professional Legal Services, 520 7 Financial & Performance Audits, 520 8 Complementary Audit Services, 520 9 Recovery Audits, 520 10 Transportation Audits (small business set-aside), 520 11 Accounting, 520 12 Budgeting, 520 13 Complementary Financial Management Services, 520 14 Audit & Financial Training Services (small business set-aside), 520 15 Outsourcing Recurring Commercial Activities for Financial Management Services, 520 16 Business Information Services, 520 17 Risk Assessment and Mitigation Services, 520 18 Independent Risk Analysis, 520 19 Data Breach Analysis, 520 20 Comprehensive Protection Solutions, 520 21 Program Management Services, 520 22 Grants Management Support Services; and 520 23 Ancillary Supplies and/or Services.

For more information, please visit the Financial and Business Solutions home page at http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104504

PLEASE NOTE: Effective February 28, 2010, all responses shall be submitted electronically as an eOffer (http://eoffer.gsa.gov). Hard copy responses will no longer be accepted.

Notice: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 72 days before your offer is evaluated.

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

GSA still recognizes the important role of our schedule holders who have long supported the MAS program. Since holding a schedule contract is a very expensive proposition for the schedule holder and GSA, we are reallocating our resources to better serve our customer base. Current Schedule 75 contract holders with available options that are successfully performing will continue to be exercised. Additionally, modification requests to existing contracts will still be honored.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: -- Please refer to FedBid for complete list of contract requirement(s) and terms and conditions. <BR> <BR>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2014)<br /> (a)  Purpose.  The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br /> (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br /> (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br /> (b)  Scope.

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br /> (c)  Warrant and Disclosure.  The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors.  The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict.  The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.  <br /> (d)  Remedies.  The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest.  If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br /> (e)  Subcontracts.  The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br /> (f)  Prime Contractor Responsibilities.  The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest.  The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.  If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.  If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g)  Waiver.  The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

Specific service requirements are identified in the attached Statement of Work (SOW). This procurement is being conducted under the Subpart 13.5 Test Program and simplified acquisition procedures apply. The intent is to award a one-year base contract with four additional one-year option periods.  The option periods may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.

This is a 100% small business set aside. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 621910, Ambulance Services, with a small business size standard of $15.0 million. This procurement is a total small business set-aside and all eligible offerors may submit quotes. All offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov to be considered for an award of a federal contract. The record shall be complete and not missing elements such as Representations and Certifications.

The Government will evaluate offers using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable source selection process. Award will be made on the basis of the Lowest Evaluated Price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors that represents the best value and overall lowest cost to the Government. Non-price factors will be rated on an "Acceptable/Unacceptable" basis. Failure to meet any of the requirements will result in an "Unacceptable" rating and eliminate the offer from further consideration for contract award. Failure to submit a complete proposal may result in the proposal being deemed technically unacceptable. To be technically acceptable, offerors shall submit the following:
(1)	The offeror shall provide a current copy of liability insurance with offer that meets the referenced amounts:
(2)	The offeror shall have a minimum of four (4) years demonstrated experience providing ALS/BLS Ground Ambulance Transportation Service. Offeror to list experience with the past three years and provide a reference for each contract or job and include the following:
"	Company Name and Address
"	Description of Services Performed
"	Name, Telephone Number, Email Address of responsible individual(s) who have first-hand knowledge of performance relative to the same type of service.
"	Date(s) of performance
(3)	License and Certification. Offeror shall include a copy of all licenses and certifications for the contractor and contractor employees that will provide services under the contract.
(4)	Vehicle Information. Offeror to include a listing of all vehicles, specifications, pictures, quantity, and safety equipment.
(5)	Past Performance. Offerors shall provide past performance history. The currency and relevance of the information, source of information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance shall be considered. Offerors shall provide past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to the VA's requirement. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions. The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror's past performance. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, offeror shall explain the relevance of the data provided for each reference. Offerors with no relevant past performance or whom information is not available, shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Supplemental Insurance Requirements. In accordance with FAR 28.307-2 and FAR 52.228-5, the following minimum coverage shall apply to this contract: 
(a)	Workers' compensation and employers liability: Contractors are required to comply with applicable Federal and State workers' compensation and occupational disease statutes. If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer's liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a Contractor's commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage. Employer's liability coverage of at least $100,000 is required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers' compensation to be written by private carriers.
(b)	General Liability: $500,000.00 per occurrences.
(c)	Automobile liability: $200,000.00 per person; $500,000.00 per occurrence and $20,000.00 property damage.
(d)	The successful bidder must present to the Contracting Officer, prior to award, evidence of general liability insurance without any exclusionary clauses for asbestos that would void the general liability coverage.

<p>Ombudsman Notice</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>Ombudsman Notice<br /> NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br /> United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br /> It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br /> Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.<br /> Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br /> procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /> Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br /> Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br /> Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br /> The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>Question 6. Does the current contractor use a subcontractor for maintenance and repairs of the equipment and if so what is the Subcontractor's name, address and telephone number?</p>
<p>Answer 6. Yes, the current contractor uses a subcontractor. That information can also be obtained via FOIA request.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by Wisconsin Physicians Services under contract number HHSM-500-2011-M0006Z in the amount of $505,287&nbsp;authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.<br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified<br />electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.<br /><br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).

<DESC>The responses to this Sources Sought will be utilized to determine if any Small Business Set-aside opportunities exist. All Small Business Set-aside categories will be considered. In addition, this market research tool is being used to identify potential and eligible firms, of all sizes, prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a solicitation.
<p>Capability statements are also being requested via an Advance Planning notice posted on the Seaport-e portal (http://www.seaport.navy.mil/default.aspx) from all Zone 2, large and small businesses interested in the procurement and via FBO. In your capability statement, please state whether or not you would prefer to contract via Seaport-e. If your company does not have a preference, please state so in your capability statement. Whether or not the Government will procure this requirement via Seaport-e will be determined by the responses we receive from interested companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
<p>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Contracts Department (AIR 2.5.1.12), Patuxent River, MD announces its intention to procure, on a competitive basis, the services necessary to support the Air Vehicle Test &amp; Evaluation Division (AIR-5.1.6) of the Integrated System Evaluation, Experimentation &amp; Test (ISEET) Department (AIR-5.1) of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). This requirement is a follow-on procurement to task order N00178-04-D-4080-M803 currently being performed by ManTech Systems Engineering Corporation. The existing task order is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Term type. This task order is currently due to expire 26 March 2015; however, the Government will likely extend this contract to prevent a gap in service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong></p>
<p>The Product Service Code (PSC) for this effort is R425; the applicable NAICS is 541330 Engineering Services with a Small Business Size standard of $38.5 Million. Businesses of all sizes are encouraged to respond; however, each respondent must clearly identify their business size in their capabilities statement. Specifically, the Government is evaluating the possibility of establishing this requirement as a Small Business/Other Socio-economic Set-Aside. As such, all eligible SB/SDVOSBs/8(a)/etc in are encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The Air Vehicle Test &amp; Evaluation Division (AIR-5.1.6) is responsible for test of air vehicles (manned or unmanned), as well as those systems related to and associated with the air vehicle, for example landing systems, weapon systems, in-flight refueling systems, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance includes a base period of 12 months and 4 one-year options for a total performance period of 5 years. The anticipated start date is 26 March 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ANTICIPATED CONTRACT TYPE</strong></p>
<p>The contract type is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract or Seaport-e Task Order with Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Term (LOE) CLINs. The total LOE is estimated at 800,840 man-hours (based on 1,920 hours per year) with up to 31,585 overtime man-hours over a period of five years. These services shall be performed on-site (90%) at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, MD and off-site at the contractor's facility (10%).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>A Draft SOW (including projected labor categories &amp; personnel qualifications) and Draft projected Level of Effort are attached for review. Please note these documents are subject to change.</p>
<p>Feedback from industry is being sought on the SOW, and suggestions/recommendations on CLIN structure for the basic contract award. If your company has any questions about the structure of the SOW, or areas that may need further definition, please also identify those in your response.</p>
<p>In addition to the requirements above, please note that under a Small Business Set-Aside, the small business prime must perform at least 50% of the work themselves in terms of cost of performance. Cost of performance includes direct labor costs, overhead that has only direct labor as its base, and the small business' General &amp; Administrative rate multiplied by the labor cost. The small business prime cannot utilize the cost performance of other small businesses it utilizes as subcontractors in calculating its performance to comply with FAR Clause 52.219-14. If your company is a joint venture, please note that Seaport-e does not permit Joint Ventures. As can be seen from the most recent rolling admissions RFP, N00178-14-R-4000, under "Additional Instructions to Offerors" in Section L, paragraph 3.11 states that "proposals submitted by Joint Ventures will not be considered for award." Because Joint Ventures are not permitted for award of basic contracts within Seaport-e, please instead specify that you are a joint venture in your capability statement and state that your preferred contracting method is outside Seaport-e. Joint ventures should also be aware that the cost of performance by both small business concerns is utilized in calculating its performance to comply with FAR 52.219-14.</p>
<p>Since at least a portion of the resultant contract will be on a cost-type basis, the successful awardees will also be required to have a Government approved accounting system upon contract award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SUBMITTAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>It is requested that interested businesses submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating ability to perform the services listed in the attached SOW. This documentation must address, at a minimum, the following:</p>
<p>1. What type of work has your company performed in the past in support of the same or similar requirement?<br />2. Can or has your company managed a task of this nature? If so, please provide details.<br />3. Can or has your company managed a team of subcontractors before? If so, please cite contracts and teaming arrangement.<br />4. What specific technical skills does your company possess which ensures capability to perform the tasks?<br />5. If you are a small business, provide an explanation of your company's ability to perform at least 50% of the tasking described in this SOW for the base period as well as the option periods. <br />6. Provide a statement including current small/large business status and company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office locations, CAGE code, DUNS number, etc. <br />7. Respondents to this notice must also indicate whether they are a large business or qualify as a Small, Small Disadvantaged, Small Disadvantaged Veteran Owned Small Business, Women-Owned, 8(a), Hub Zone or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern.<br />8. Include in your response your preferred contracting method (within or outside of Seaport-e)</p>

<DESC><p><br />SHELTER CARE FOR UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), and the Program Support Center (PSC) are seeking a qualified business to perform the following requirement. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations.</p>
<p>The information from this market research will help the ACF Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) obtain information about sources capable to provide services to unaccompanied children during an influx.</p>
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH. HHS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p>This Notice is issued solely for information and market research purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP. Furthermore, those who respond to this Notice should not anticipate feedback with regard to its submission. This Notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. ORR is not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this Notice. All costs associated with responding to this Notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this Notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>This past summer, the Federal government responded to a significant increase in the number of unaccompanied children who were apprehended on the southwest border, with an aggressive, coordinated Federal response focused on providing humanitarian care for the children as well as heightened deterrence, enhanced enforcement, stronger foreign cooperation, and greater capacity for Federal agencies to ensure that our border remains secure. As a result of these efforts, the number of unaccompanied children attempting to cross the southwest border has declined precipitously, and the Federal government continues to focus its resources to prevent a similar situation from developing in the future. At the same time, ACF is continuing to develop efficient, cost-effective strategies to address the types of historical variations in border crossings by unaccompanied children.<br /><br />On March 1, 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Section 462, transferred responsibilities for the care and placement of unaccompanied children from the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Since then, ORR has incorporated child welfare values as well as the principles and provisions established by the Flores Agreement in 1997, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its reauthorization acts, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2005 and 2008.</p>
<p>The Office of Refugee Resettlement provides temporary shelter care and other related services to unaccompanied children in ORR custody. Shelter care services begin once ORR accepts a child for placement and ends when the minor is released from ORR custody. Shelter care and other related services are provided in the least restrictive setting appropriate for the child's age and special needs. This Notice is to identify potential offers capable of providing services required to support a temporary influx of unaccompanied children.</p>
<p>In preparation for future influxes of unaccompanied children, ORR seeks information that it may use to develop options for contract surge capacity to shelter and care for these children on a time-limited and expandable basis as needed. Due to the nature of unaccompanied children arrivals, ORR seeks sources for a contract vehicle that is flexible, cost-efficient, and could provide the following services on a regional basis throughout the United States:</p>
<p>1) Staffing<br />2) Wrap-Around Services<br />3) Temporary Structures<br />4) Training and Technical Assistance (T&amp;TA)<br />5) Transportation</p>
<p>No decisions have been made about the need for surge capacity in 2015, or whether or not contracts would be awarded for each of these elements. The purpose of this Notice is solely to identify possible sources to the agency in the event of a future influx of children.</p>
<p>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>ORR requests information that it may use to develop options for indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts to provide for an indefinite quantity of the specified services for a fixed time. The potential competition and award of a five-year (base year plus four option years) IDIQ contract could provide comprehensive surge capabilities for future influx of children and should provide for appropriate cost/pricing arrangements by the award of task order for services on an as-needed basis. Cost/pricing arrangements should provide for an estimated quantity of supplies or services (e.g., estimated number of labor hours) and would be funded in full at the time of the task award. A contract may cover one or more of the five categories. The initial award of the base year contract and each option year would require a minimum amount of funding for the development of service infrastructure.</p>
<p>The staffing and wrap around services, identified on a regional basis, could support surge locations. The T&amp;TA contract could support these surge sites as well as surge or new providers so that these sites are in full compliance in terms of fulfilling the mission and goals of ORR. Finally, the transportation contract could support releases to his or her sponsor by coordinating travel at a national level for all release and transfer of children.</p>
<p>Specifically information is sought for the following services. Responses to this notice should illustrate capabilities related to one or more of the following categories:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Staffing</p>
<p>The purpose of the staffing contract would be to provide staffing services at ORR-identified shelter locations to provide the management, supervision, and required services to children. Staff support is defined as formal and informal services provided to ensure children's safety and care. The contractor would provide all positions identified and described in the Statement of Work, including licensed professionals, program management staff, and supervision of daily operations. The contractor would provide all logistical support for the travel and equipment needed to fulfill the requirements under the Task Order (s). The contractor would provide scalable staffing plans to serve 100 - 2,500 children with ramp-up and draw-down capabilities.</p>
<p>Wrap-Around Services</p>
<p>The purpose of the wrap-around services contract would be to provide all support services at ORR-identified shelter locations. The mission would include feeding, cleaning, maintenance and facility preparation, clothing, linens and laundry, transportation, recreational equipment, security, hygiene kits, medical supplies, and custodial services. Depending on the needs of the facility, wrap-around services could include portable toilets and hand washing stations, mobile trailers for offices. Security services would include unarmed security guards and any equipment, such as closed-circuit television networks and communication devices as directed by the government. Maintenance and facility preparation services could include fencing for the property, painting and building repairs, industrial cleaning, addressing non-ADA compliance factors, and other preparations needed to accommodate the sheltering of children in the facilities.</p>
<p>Temporary Structures</p>
<p>No decisions have been made regarding the need for surge capacity in 2015, but ORR is exploring options available should the need arise. The purpose of the temporary structures with staffing and services is to identify agencies capable of standing-up soft-sided structures, trailers, or other temporary structures that could shelter 100-2,500 children on federally leased or owned land. These agencies would be responsible for the building maintenance and all services to the building, including electricity and plumbing.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>Under normal, steady state operations, a sponsor is required to pay any transportation costs associated for the child to travel from the shelter to the sponsor's location. During an influx of children, ORR may waive the requirement for sponsors to arrange travel and associated costs of releasing the children from the shelter and place with the sponsor. In these instances, ORR seeks information regarding a national transportation contractor to make travel arrangements for children in ORR standard shelters and temporary surge facilities. The travel contractor would be responsible for purchasing transportation, including flights, trains, buses, and car rentals, for the children and an escort, if applicable, to release the child.</p>
<p><br />Training and Technical Assistance</p>
<p>The mission of ORR is to provide unaccompanied children with a safe and appropriate environment while providing the highest quality of care that is client-focused and maximizes the child's potential both in-care and once released to a sponsor. As part of this mission, ORR focuses on identifying and releasing the child to a sponsor while the child is in immigration proceedings. In order to effectively stand-up temporary surge shelters, ORR is seeking information regarding a training and technical assistance provider to train staff. The training would include ORR policies and procedures, completing sponsor packets, use of the ORR web-based database, and implementing best practices to provide high quality services to the children. While this contract would be primarily targeted towards temporary surge facilities, in fiscal year 2014, ORR awarded nearly 22 new grants to shelter providers and could request the training and technical assistance provider to work with new grantees which operate standard shelter beds.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT</p>
<p>ORR is seeking sources capable of providing the services outlined above, including regions which could be served, cost/pricing estimates, length of time needed to become operational, and number of children able to serve.</p>
<p>INFORMATION SOUGHT AND SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>All inquiries to this Notice must be in writing to linda.jules-o'neil@psc.hhs.gov.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition for its Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) for Operating and Computing Environment (OCE) for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA). Accordingly, the TSA intends to award a 9 month interim bridge contract to InfoZen, Inc., located at 6700 A Rockledge Drive, Suite 300, Bethesda, MD.
<p>This new interim bridge contract will allow for the continuation of services and will continue to address the requirements of the OIA for the deployment, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a broad range of transportation vetting programs designed to protect the U.S. Transportation system against terrorism and threats to National Security. In general, vetting is described as the thorough examination or investigation of the behaviors, connections, sympathies, associations, and conveyances of persons, goods, things, and entities to identify explicit and implicit associations for suitability and reliability for a particular activity that requires a high degree of trust or loyalty.</p>
<p>This interim bridge contract will also continue to provide continuous, uninterrupted service of manufacturer hardware and software renewal maintenance support for the OIA Operations and Maintenance of the Operating and Computing Environment (OIA/OCE) at TSA HQ, Colorado Springs, CO and Annapolis Junction, MD.</p>
<p>This interim bridge contract will provide a base period of performance of 100 days and one (1) six-month option period to support the continuous, uninterrupted service to the OIA OCE beginning December 16, 2014 through September 15, 2015 (if option is exercised). The estimated ceiling costs for this interim bridge contract is approximately $11,654,157.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. All responses received within four (4) calendar days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed interim bridge contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above named company directly.<br /><br />NOTE: Please see attached the Justification and Approval for this award.</p>

<DESC>Pre Solicitation Notice for W912GB-15-R-0004   <br>    <br>  Project Title and Location: Integrated Training Area Management GIS Services Contract for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015   <br>    <br>  The United States (U.S.) Government is soliciting interest for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multi Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide training land management capability across the total Army.  The US Army recognizes that the execution of training to doctrinal standards under realistic combat conditions will affect the environment.  The ITAM Program is also an essential part of the Army's commitment to environmental stewardship.  ITAM establishes a systematic framework for decision-making and management of Army training lands.  This allows the Army to manage its land in an environmentally sound manner to ensure no net loss of training lands for accomplishing primary activities (training, testing, storage, etc,) or for impacting the overall training capability.  The effective integration of stewardship principles into training land and conservation management practices ensures that the Army's lands remain viable to support future training and mission requirements indefinitely.  It integrates elements of operational, environmental, master planning, and other programs to identify and assess land use alternatives.  The ITAM Program thus supports sound natural and cultural resource management practices to provide stewardship of land assets, while sustaining those assets to support training, testing, and other installation missions.  The ITAM program consists of four major elements:  (i) Range and Training Land Assessment (RTLA, (ii) Training Requirements Integration (TRI), (iii) Land Rehabilitation and Maintenance (LRAM), (iv) Sustainable Range Awareness (SRA).    <br>  The Contractor shall support the aforementioned programs (depending upon the particular scope of the work contained in an individual Task Order) by conducting appropriate field surveys, field sampling, investigations, site visits, interviews, and literature searches; execute suitable studies; prepare satisfactory reports, prepare plans and specifications, perform on-going site monitoring, Geographic Information System support, imagery/drawings, cartographic mapping, and provide on-site support to assist in performing Sustainable Range Program (SRP) related tasks.  Any or all of the above may be required during the period of this contract.  Those work efforts described above may occur at any location described below.  <br>  There will be one (1) solicitation for the following geographical locations:  Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and Slovenia.  Majority of the work is anticipated to be primarily in Germany.  <br>  Each project task order awarded under this contract shall normally be comprised of a number of pre-described and pre-packed tasks as described in each Task Order and the Unit Price Book.  <br>  The Award of this contract will be made on best value to the Government. Price and Technical factors will be considered.  <br>    <br>  a. PERFORMANCE PERIOD:   <br>  A base period of one (1) year and (3) three-year option periods.  <br>    <br>  b. MAXIMUM CONTRACT VALUE:   <br>  It is anticipated $2,375,000.00 annually for the base period and 3 option years, not-to-exceed $9,500,000 for the entire life of the contract.  <br>    <br>  c. MINIMUM GUARANTEE:   <br>  A single minimum guarantee amount of $5,000 covers the base period and any option period(s).   <br>    <br>  d. TASK ORDER LIMITATIONS:   <br>  The minimum task order is $2,500 and the maximum task order is $1,250,000 (reference clause 52.216-19).  On a case by case basis the Contracting Officer has the authority to issue task orders that may exceed the maximum task order limit.  <br>    <br>  A draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to encourage early Contractor involvement. Potential offerors are encouraged to submit questions related to this notice or the draft SOW no later than Friday 09 January 2014 to Contract Specialist Ian McClary at Ian.R.McClary@usace.army.mil and Contracting Officer Frank Johnson at Frank.j.Johnson@usace.army.mil.
