<DESC>Industry Day for Curriculum Development for Probation and Pretrial Services Office <br /><br />The Probation and Pretrial Services Office and the Procurement Management Division of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) will be holding an Industry Day to discuss the requirements for the development of curriculum that can be used by probation officers and treatment providers to teach offenders the necessary skills to change their faulty thinking, steer clear of antisocial peers and develop prosocial networks, maintain employment and address educational deficits, address alcohol/drug use, and recognize triggers to violence and refrain from violent behaviors. Additionally, the AO is tasked to develop and implement a self-paced curriculum for offenders and offenders' support networks to follow so the offenders can independently work on these identified skills.<br /><br />The attached document is a rough draft of our requirements for this project, which is estimated to be from $5 to $10 million. It is provided for your review and to facilitate an interactive discussion during the Industry Day, particularly as it relates to the format of the Schedule of Items, the Statement of Work, the deliverable schedule, the Key Personnel requirements, and the proposal preparation instructions.<br /><br />We welcome any thoughts, recommendations, or questions in advance of the forum, so we may consider those as we prepare. There will also be the opportunity to submit questions (anonymously, if preferred) and to participate in the discussion during the Industry Day.
<p>The Industry Day will be held in the Mecham Conference Center at the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building (TMFJB), One Columbus Circle NE, Washington DC 20544, from 10 AM to 12 noon on Wednesday, January 13, 2016. Interested parties are invited to attend in person or through web-enabled participation.</p>
<p>Please reply no later than noon, Wednesday, January 6, 2016, to janet_peterson@ao.uscourts.gov and michelle_hupp@ao.uscourts.gov indicating if you will attend in person or online. If in person, include the names of all attendees so we can provide that to our Security Staff for admission to the TMFJB. A valid photo ID must be submitted at the South Guard Station, without exception. If participating online, include the email address of everyone so we can send an invitation with a link to the webcast.</p>

<DESC>Stryker Lethality Upgrade
<p>The United States Army Contracting Command - Warren (ACC WRN), intends to award one five-year hybrid Cost type/Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. (GDLS) in support of the Stryker Lethality upgrade. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. An award date of 15 January 2016 is anticipated for this action.</p>
<p>This proposed contract will procure the NRE efforts to design, develop, build, and test eight prototype vehicles from Government-furnished Flat Bottom (FB) Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICVs) and integrate a turreted system with a 30mm gun. A total of 91 Stryker ICVs will be upgraded based on this directed requirement; 81 upgraded Stryker ICVs will be provided to 2nd Cavalry Regiment (2CR); eight will be provided to the program office for conducting the necessary test actions to develop, assess, and field the upgraded platform; and two will be provided as Operational Readiness Floats. Initial delivery of the production vehicles will begin September 2017.</p>
<p>A contract award to GDLS for the Stryker Lethality requirements is necessary since the Government does not own the system-level TDPs or comprehensive product level drawings to satisfy Army requirements through full and open competition. GDLS owns and manages the only existing collection of technical information on the Stryker FoV and major subsystems generated over 15-plus years. Therefore, without competitive rights to the systems-level TDP, any other contractor would have to recreate the systems-level technical data needed to perform this effort causing an unacceptable delay.<br /><br />To maximize subcontracting opportunities, the OEM will be directed contractually to compete work at principal subcontractor and lower tier vendor levels in support of Government competition objectives.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals. Contractors shall not submit proposals in response to this notice.</p>

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING SPECIALIST.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

This is a market survey for potential replacement infrared (IR) cameras to be used in the northern border Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) in support of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.
   
At this time the nature of any potential competition has not been determined.  If a need materializes, the FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest, capabilities, and rough orders of magnitude from all businesses that are interested in and capable of providing the replacement RVSS IR cameras.  This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the potential acquisition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards for this effort:

NAICS		Size Standard
334310		750 Employees

The contractor will supply personnel and resources necessary to provide the required IR cameras.  The northern border RVSS currently utilizes L3 WALRSS HD IR cameras (see attached item description).   CBP and FAA are currently seeking industry input for a potential replacement northern border RVSS IR camera.  The FAA is seeking information and capability of both cooled and uncooled cameras for this application.  Any potential replacement camera solution will need to be comparable to the L3 WALRSS HD IR camera in form, fit, and function.     

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

The FAA requires the following (limited to 30 pages) from interested vendors in accordance with this announcement: 

1. Capability Statement - This document should identify: 
      - Type of supplies and services provided by your firm
      - Size and type of supplies/services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance)                                
      - Number of years in business

2.  Clearly state whether or not you can provide all of the types of supplies required. 

3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

4.  Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) or budgetary estimate for the replacement IR camera.

All responses to this market survey must be received by 4:00 p.m. CST, 24 December 2015.  The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following: 

Email: robert.lafollette@faa.gov

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Boston University Medical Campus, 85 East Newton Street, M-921, Boston, MA 02118-2340 to provide scientific support services to the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) in accordance with the following information:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; NHLBI) -- embarked on an ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic.</p>
<p>The objective of the Framingham Heart Study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The Framingham Heart Study continues to make important scientific contributions by enhancing its research capabilities and capitalizing on its inherent resources.</p>
<p>While pursuing the study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators are expanding their research into other areas. An exciting new area of research inquiry is eHealth - or collecting study information using electronic tools such as digital sensors.  We are performing a pilot study to determine the feasibility of using the Health eHeart Study (HeH), a digital cohort with existing infrastructure to collect internet-based, self-reported data and wearable sensor data in a pilot study with Framingham Heart Study participants.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of the Framingham Heart Study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The Framingham Heart Study continues to make important scientific contributions by enhancing its research capabilities and capitalizing on its inherent resources.</p>
<p>While pursuing the study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators are expanding their research into other areas. An exciting new area of research inquiry is eHealth - or collecting study information using electronic tools such as digital sensors.  We have completed our pilot study to determine the feasibility of using the Health eHeart Study (HeH), a digital cohort with existing infrastructure to collect internet-based, self-reported data and wearable sensor data in a pilot study with Framingham Heart Study participants and are now expending this model to a Full cohort which will be referred to as eFHS (electronic Framingham Heart Study).</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to conduct a full cohort eHealth study coinciding with the Framingham Heart Study Gen III Exam III clinic visit to initiate in April 2016.</p>
<p>TASKS TO BE PERFORMED</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Conduct a full cohort eHealth study coinciding with the Framingham Heart Study Gen III Exam III clinic visit to initiate in April 2016 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants, called eFHS.</p>
<p>Each eVisit is tied to the upcoming clinical exam the participants will attend at part of Gen III Exam III and will add to the clinical session a eFHS session. The Boston University (BU) Staff operating the FHS clinic will initiate the study, preview the websites, and to activate and link the sensors. Participants also will be provided a suite of sensors that will include a Bluetooth BP cuff, a Bluetooth scale, an activity monitor, and an ECG smartphone case. Each device will be activated and linked to the study website by the participant.</p>
<p>Three months after completion of eVisit 1, they will be invited to complete eVisit 2.  In addition, we will perform an "exit interview" regarding the eFHS experience with a focus on burden. In order to enhance engagement and retention, participants will receive eFHS-based automated communication and reminders via email, SMS or system alerts. Automated communications and emails will be supplemented by phone calls from FHS staff only if needed.</p>
<p>The Overarching Aims of the eFHS program are below, but this contract will primarily focus on the BU clinical support component that pertains to FHs Participant Contact-which must be conducted by BU staff.</p>
<p>Aim 1: App development</p>
<p>Develop a smartphone app and associated web-based platform for use within the FHS that will collect information regarding demographic, lifestyle, and CVD risk factors.</p>
<p>Aim 2: App validation</p>
<p>Against quantitative clinic-collected phenotypes. Implement data collection using the app and validate these components against in-person collected data in the Third Generation FHS exam. We hypothesize that in vivo assessment of lifestyle and CVD risk factors will be similar to in-person collected examination data within the FHS.</p>
<p>Aim 3: App development to collect health care encounters.</p>
<p>We will develop a smartphone app module to ascertain health care encounters and we will validate MI and AF against adjudicated FHS MI and AF. We hypothesize that smartphone collected MI and AF will have at least 80% sensitivity and specificity versus gold-standard adjudicated MI and AF.</p>
<p>Aim 4: Risk prediction of endpoints.</p>
<p>Assess CVD (clinical and subclinical) and metabolic burden using digitally collected data and examine associations with clinical and subclinical CVD. Risk characterization of MI and AF will be augmented by combining traditional clinical data with digital, longitudinal, and more frequent in vivo behavioral and health data. Further, digitally collected risk factor data will perform as well as the components of the FRS for MI and AF when collected at in-person examinations.</p>
<p>Aim 5: Extend data collection beyond the FHS with the launch of eFHS, an electronic and digital extension of the FHS and examine the associations between CVD risk factors and CVD endpoints.</p>
<p>CVD risk characterization in eFHS will demonstrate similar risk-factor and outcome relationships to what has been demonstrated in cohort studies, and will augment the geographic diversity of the FHS.</p>
<p>The contractor shall also:</p>
<p>A.	Train staff on eFHS protocols consistent with FHS Clinical Exam Policy<br />B.	Recruit FHS participants into the optional eFHS component of their Clinical Exam visit<br />C.	Conduct informed consent for eFHS segment of the Clinical Exam visit<br />D.	Maintain constant compliance with all IRB and OSMB clinical patient contact requirements<br />E.	Training of participants on use of tools and smartphone app and digital equipment<br />F.	Enrollment of participants into on-line portal of data transfer and record keeping<br />G.	Troubleshoot and act as liaison to enrolled participant that may require additional hardware or assistance with repeat trainings<br />H.	Data cleaning of electronic data<br />I.	Attend/Coordinate Meetings with Team at BU/NHLBI</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The period of performance will be January 4, 2016 through January 3, 2017.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that this work must be conducted by Boston University staff since this requires participant contact with the Framingham Heart Study participants.  Their contact information is considered sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and this is exposed to a very small set of Boston University individuals for the complete protection of the participants.

Marble shall be fine grained, sound and compact, free from cracks, spalls, chips, holes, calcite lines more than two inches in length, open seams, pits, or other defects that would impair its strength, durability or appearance.  The overall background whiteness of the marble, exclusive of allowable veining, shall be no less than standard N8.5 of the Munsell Neutral Value Scale, 31 Step Scale.   Background colors with noticeable contrast in chroma or hue (example: mixing silver or gray background tones with cream or yellow background tones) are unacceptable.  Various colored veins, no darker than N6 of the Munsell Neutral Value Scale, may blend gradually into the white background.  Blotches of color, or veining which are in sharp contrast with the background whiteness, which would inhibit legibility of the inscription, or which present an objectionable appearance, shall be cause for rejection. 
The face and sides of each blank shall be uniformly machine honed to a finish using 80 grit and display a smooth satin surface, free of scratches, saw marks, rust spots and skips. The back of the niche covers shall have a smooth- sawn finish or finer.  All edges along the front, back and corners shall be uniformly rounded.

Back-up center(s) will be required to be a member of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) or be accredited by the American Association of Suicidology (AAS) at the time of award as well as maintaining the particular membership or accreditation throughout the life of the contract.
The Government intends to compete the requirement among Small Business Offerors, and issue one Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) contract, Period of Performance from 1 April 2016 through 31 March 2017 with four (4) 12-Month Option Years. 
This acquisition will be 100% set-aside for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 517919 and the Size Standard is $32.5M.

<DESC>Request for Information: <br />Replacement of HH-60G Control/Display Unit<br />This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may be able to supply a non-developmental, qualified, in-production replacement Control Display Unit and associated Operational Flight Program (OFP) software for use in the United States Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk aircraft. Sole source is anticipated due to the lack of data. This effort will require some performance at a security classification level of secret, and the amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined. <br />Contractor shall furnish all material, support equipment, tools, test equipment, and services. The contractor is responsible for providing, maintaining, and calibrating all support equipment required at their facility or a subcontractor's facility. Contractor furnished material or parts used for replacement shall equal or exceed the quality of the original material or parts.
<p>Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.<br />In accordance with FAR 52.215-3:<br />a. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br />b. Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br />c.

<p>INSTRUCTIONS: <br />1. Below is a document containing a description of the Control Display Unit solution requirement and a Contractor Capability Survey, which allows you to provide your company's capability.</p>
<p>2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)</p>
<p><br />3. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>
<p>4. Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed to Bill Walton, (478) 926-7525, william.walton.2@us.af.mil &emsp;<br />Request for Information: Replacement of HH-60G Control/Display Unit<br />PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION<br />We are conducting market research to identify potential sources to supply a non-developmental, qualified, in-production Control Display Unit and associated Operational Flight Program software for use on the USAF HH-60G aircraft. The Control Display Unit serves as the aircrew's primary interface with navigation &amp; communications systems, performs mission planning functions, and serves as controller for the aircraft's MIL-STD-1553 data busses. The Control Display Unit currently in use has no processing margin for future growth, exhibits a low and decreasing mean time between failures, and requires replacement. The unit to be replaced is the Canadian Marconi (CMC) CMA 882-5 CDU (P/N: 100-601433-005, NSN: 5895-21-921-3286, CAGE 90073)</p>
<p>Two Control Display Units (CDUs), one for each pilot, are located on the lower console in the HH-60G cockpit. The CDUs display mission data and permit operator entry and modification of mission data. The CDUs also provide information exchange between the flight crew and the navigation systems. The CDUs front panel provides a 3 inch by 5 inch display, mounted with a keyboard composed of 29 alphanumeric keys, two rocker keys (one of which provides manual brightness control), ten display adjacent software-programmable keys (soft keys), automatic brightness control, and four annunciators. The CDUs exchange data with mission subsystems by operating as bus controller on a dual redundant MIL-STD-1553B data bus and via an ARINC 429 data bus. The CDUs also act as volatile storage repositories for mission data. They receive and transmit mission data via the data buses. In the event of one CDU failure, the other CDU takes and maintains control without any degradation in operational capability. In the event of Bus Controller (BC) CDU failure, the Remote Terminal (RT) CDU takes and maintains control. A subsequent "Good" status will cause BC to shift back to the Primary Control Display Unit (PCDU). During BC swaps, all NAV modes will be maintained. Whenever power is on, the CDUs continuously monitor all internal critical functions. They report out-of-tolerance conditions via front panel Annunciators and the display area. The CDUs are powered through two 5 AMP circuit breakers on the No. 2 DC primary bus (marked PCDU and CPCDU) in the aft console circuit breaker panel. The power to the CDUs is backed up by the aircraft battery to maintain CDU operation during power transitions. <br />&emsp;<br />The Control Display Unit Solution should meet the following requirements:<br />- The unit must fit within the physical envelope of the current CDU: 5 11/16" wide x 9 11/32" tall faceplate, fit inside 5" Dzus rails, maximum depth 6 13/16" behind rails. <br />- The unit must have a display screen no smaller than 3" x 5", portrait orientation, viewable in sunlight conditions from at least +/- 65 degrees off normal.<br />- The unit-display and keypad lighting-must be NVIS compatible<br />- The keypad must provide a man-machine interface identical to the CMA-882 unit currently in use<br />- The unit must be capable of functioning as bus controller and/or remote terminal for MIL-STD-1553 data busses, and provide ARINC 429 and Ethernet interfaces<br />- The unit must already be qualified throughout the H-60 environmental and flight envelope and in production or production-ready without further development. <br />- The unit should be able to host the HH-60G Control Display Unit Operational Flight Program, as currently complied in the Pascal &amp; Assembly languages, or a rehosted version of this OFP in a different language such as C++. The current CDU OFP consists of 146,000 Pascal SLOCs and 72,000 Assembly SLOCs. If a rehost is necessary, please provide information on your company's approach to performing the rehost effort, experience with similar rehost efforts, maturity of software rehost process, and any software certifications such as CMMI. <br />- The unit shall meet the same MIL-STD-704F power requirements as the current CDU (maximum power not to exceed 90W).</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought - Stryker Lethality Upgrade
<p>The United States Army Contracting Command - Warren (ACC WRN), intends to award one five-year hybrid Cost type/Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. (GDLS) in support of the Stryker Lethality upgrade. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. An award date of 15 January 2016 is anticipated for this action.</p>
<p>This proposed contract will procure the NRE efforts to design, develop, build, and test eight prototype vehicles from Government-furnished Flat Bottom (FB) Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICVs) and integrate a turreted system with a 30mm gun. A total of 91 Stryker ICVs will be upgraded based on this directed requirement; 81 upgraded Stryker ICVs will be provided to 2nd Cavalry Regiment (2CR); eight will be provided to the program office for conducting the necessary test actions to develop, assess, and field the upgraded platform; and two will be provided as Operational Readiness Floats. Initial delivery of the production vehicles will begin September 2017.</p>
<p>A contract award to GDLS for the Stryker Lethality requirements is necessary since the Government does not own the system-level TDPs or comprehensive product level drawings to satisfy Army requirements through full and open competition. GDLS owns and manages the only existing collection of technical information on the Stryker FoV and major subsystems generated over 15-plus years. Therefore, without competitive rights to the systems-level TDP, any other contractor would have to recreate the systems-level technical data needed to perform this effort causing an unacceptable delay.<br />To maximize subcontracting opportunities, the OEM will be directed contractually to compete work at principal subcontractor and lower tier vendor levels in support of Government competition objectives.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may identify their interest and provide capability statements in response to this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>

<p>Project Title: Workforce Planning and Process Improvement</p>
<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Office of International Programs (OIP) in the Office of Global Regulatory Operations and Policy (GO), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), serves as a focal point of coordination and catalytic lead for the Agency's shift from a domestic focus to global in multiple and diverse ways on behalf of the FDA Commissioner and GO Deputy Commissioner, as well as for the Agency. Within the OIP, the Executive Operations Office (ExecOps), led by the Director, is responsible for the management and coordination of GO and OIP resources, including people, money, equipment, and facilities for headquarters and FDA Foreign Posts. This includes providing management services in the areas of acquisitions, budget formulation and execution, program evaluation, process improvement, workforce planning, performance management, human resources, strategic management, international travel operations, and facilities management.</p>
<p>As a result of a General Accountability Office (GAO) study in 2010, FDA supported the GAO's recommendation to develop a workforce plan for OIP and its foreign post cadre. GO is required to develop a 5-year, scenario-based Strategic Workforce Plan (WFP), initially for OIP and subsequently for the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) to ultimately comprise a Strategic WFP for GO. The purpose of this contract is to develop the first phase of the WFP for OIP and the process to implement the strategies set forth in the WFP.</p>

William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site

Statement of Need

The historic Cassidy House at William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site (Birthplace) was damaged due to fire during the early morning hours of December 25, 2015. The local fire department quickly responded and extinguished the fire. There is fire, water, and smoke damage to the house.

The Cassidy House is located at 117 South Hervey Street, Hope, Arkansas, approximately 110 miles southwest of Little Rock, Arkansas. The Cassidy House was constructed in 1917 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is a two-story wood-framed structure and is an example of the American Foursquare type of building. The two stories are approximately 2,852 square feet. There is an attic. The house does not have a basement, but is raised above a crawl space that is accessible from two exterior hatches. There is asbestos on a water heater tank liner in the kitchen of the house. And although the house was abated of lead based coatings in 1995-1996, it was not comprehensive and lead paint was documented in concentrations greater than 5,000 ppm multiple locations in 2013.

The house is set up as a historic house museum for public tours with exhibited period furnishings consisting of upholstered furniture, wood furniture, tables, chairs, chest of drawers, framed pictures, linens, books, magazines, photos, kitchen wares, rugs, glassware, China, draperies, knick-knacks, kitchen appliances, lamps, clothing, mattress sets, pillows, vinyl records, etc. There are approximately 850 museum items displayed in the house.

As a result of the fire the interior of the house and all the furnishings are covered in a fine layer of soot and have a strong odor of the fire. The acidic nature of the soot causes discoloration, corrosion, and overall damage. There is a potential for mold growth due to water used to extinguish the fire. 

This statement is seeking proposals to clean all of the furnishings (all sides/surfaces/interiors, etc.), textiles, objects (all sides/surfaces/interiors, etc.), and interior of house (walls, ceilings, floors, fixtures, etc.) of the house to pre-fire condition. Proposal must include list of chemicals that will be used to treat for mold, reduce the smell, clean items, and chemicals used to eliminate the smoke odor for prior review and approval. Any observed damage to furnishings must be noted, for example, the high temperatures of fires can melt adhesives or plastics. Films and tapes inside containers can be much more damaged than it appears from a cursory glance of the container itself. Any loose or removed architectural features are to be collected  nothing will be thrown out. 

Work will result in all items on exhibit in the house are cleaned to pre-fire condition with no soot residue present. Interior spaces of house like walls, ceilings, floor, fixtures, appliances, etc. are cleaned with no soot residue present. Smoke odor is eliminated and an EPAs air quality index of 0-50 for particle pollution. Mold is eliminated and will not appear within 6 months of completion of contract.

The Contractor shall provide and respond to all emergency calls in accordance with Federal, State, and Local regulations, governing dispatch of emergency medical (ambulance) vehicles and medical care of on-board Patients, to include the use of sirens and other measures to ensure timely arrival at the designated VA Medical facility.
 
Response Time Compliance Rate: The Contractor shall maintain at a minimum, a 95% compliance rate on responses to pick-up or deliver during the Contract year.  Failure of the Contractor to perform in accordance with this compliance rating may constitute sufficient cause for termination of the Contract for "cause," (see FAR clause 52.212-4(m)) or other appropriate contractual action.

If the Contractor's place of business is located beyond the local telephone call zone of the VA (area code 412 and 724), the Contractor shall install and provide to the VA, a toll free number for accepting the VA calls.  It is estimated that 90% of all requests for service will be placed by telephone.  Requests for service may also be in writing or oral from an authorized representative of the VA, and may be completed by telephone, facsimile, mail, e-mail, or in person (by giving a written or verbal request).

 Electronic Transmissions:  The Contractor shall, at all times during the Contract period, have on his/her premises a functioning fax machine to communicate requirements with the VA (i.e., Patient incidents, requests for service, special correspondence, etc.).  Each Contractor shall indicate if there is e-mail availability for their company to complete communications with the VA (use of this communication system must be approved by the Contracting Officer before any communications are completed in this manner).

	Waiting Time:

 For scheduled trips, waiting charges shall commence fifteen (15) minutes from the time the Contractor actually arrives at the designated pick-up and/or delivery points.  For scheduled trips, waiting charges shall commence fifteen (15) minutes from the scheduled pick-up time or from the time the Contractor actually arrives at the designated pick-up point, whichever is later.

(b)  If the designated pick-up and/or delivery points are at other than the VA Medical facilities and waiting beyond the required fifteen (15) minute grace period is anticipated, the Contractor shall notify the travel section.  This call is only for the purpose of verifying the Contractor's time of arrival at pick-up and/or delivery points and is not necessary if the Contractor does not anticipate a delay for which waiting charges will be claimed.  The Contractor's failure to notify the Travel Section when waiting beyond the grace period shall result in non-payment for waiting time.

  Authorized Medical Center Personnel:  

Prior to performance, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with a list of names or position titles and phone numbers of authorized Government personnel who may request services and receive calls from Contractor regarding Contract performance.  This list will be updated and submitted to the Contractor as changes occur.  The Contractor shall ensure that requests for services are received from authorized medical center personnel.  Services rendered in response to requests from other than authorized personnel shall be at the risk of the Contractor and any cost related thereto shall be borne by the Contractor.


Request for Services:  

All requests will be placed against pertinent schedule items, on a unit price basis, and will be verified against invoices and Contractor's request for services log submitted under par. 19.  When ordering services (whether it is by telephone, facsimile, mail, e-mail and/or person), the VAPHS will provide the Contractor with the following type of information:

1.	Mode of transportation required,
2.	Required date and time of arrival,
3.	Name of Patient,
4.	Pick-up and delivery point, and
5.	Any other special instructions.

The Veteran's Administration will pay transportation costs only for eligible Veteran's Administration patients, as determined by Veteran's Administration regulations.  Contractors shall contact the appropriate Veterans' Administration Patient Travel Coordinator if there are any questions concerning the eligibility of the Veteran's Administration patients.

The Contractor shall be required to transport non-ambulatory Patients on gurneys, litters, and geriatric chairs who are not in need of emergency transportation or medical attention.


Contractor Personnel Security Requirements:

a.  All Contractor employees who require access to the Department of Veterans Affairs' computer systems shall be the subject of a background investigation. This requirement is applicable to all subcontractor personnel requiring the same access. The Department of Veterans Affairs Memorandum dated February 8th, 2007 (10N1-23) provides additional guidance and clarification specific to Contractors' investigations. In all cases, access (physical and computer) cannot be granted until officially notified by Security Investigations Center (SIC), Little Rock, Arkansas. Access can be granted prior to receiving final adjudication results. 

	(1) Position Sensitivity - The position sensitivity for each Contractor position is determined by the VA utilizing Position Designation Automated Tool (PDAT). Each position will be designated at the high, moderate, or low risk level, depending on the position's potential for adverse impact to the integrity and efficiency of the services (CFR 731.106). 

NOTE: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) PIV Program Office implemented the rollout of the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) program across the enterprise to more than 200 VA sites in 2009. This new policy will most likely require all Contractors to be fingerprinted at a minimum, regardless of their position at the VA. 

	(2) Background Investigation - The level of background investigation commensurate with the required level of access may be either a Special Agreement Check (SAC), National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) (low risk), Moderate Background Investigation (MBI) (moderate risk), or Background Investigation (high risk). Non-citizen Contract personnel appointed to low risk positions will be subject to a National Agency Check with Local Agency Check and Credit Check (NACLC). 

	(3) Contractor Responsibilities: 

		(a)The Contractor shall bear the expense of the background investigation(s), regardless of the final adjudication determination. A Bill of Collections shall be generated by the VA after final adjudication determination has been received. Final adjudication results may take up to six months but are normally received within 90 days after submission. Level of investigations and associated costs (per person) for on-site paramedics have been determined to be: 

___ SAC 	 
_X_ NACI 	 
___ NACLC	 
___ MBI 	 
___ BI 	

	(b) All fee schedule questions should be directed to the SIC at 512-257-4469 or 4490 or vhalitsiccontracting@va.gov. 

	(c) The Contractor shall prescreen all personnel requiring access to the computer systems to ensure they are able to read, write, speak, and understand the English language. 

	(d) The Contractor employees shall download, complete, and mail the documents required for any risk positions within forty (40) calendar days of receipt of e-mail or the investigation will be cancelled. E-mail notifications will be received by the Contractor from the VA Security Investigations Center (SIC) explaining specific instructions once an investigation has been ordered. Access to the VA cannot be granted until the SIC has received all the required documents from the Contractor. Documents and instructions can be downloaded from the following website: http://www.va.gov/vabackground_investigations 

			(1) The link above is the VA's Security Investigations Website. Select (left side of the screen) the link for the level of investigation (low, medium, or high) that is listed on the SIC e-mail message. Example Low Risk = Low Risk Contractor Position. 
			(2) The different level of investigation required forms are as follows: 

Low Risk/NACI - SF85, OF 306 and Fingerprints 
Moderate Risk/MBI - SF85P and Fingerprints 
High Risk/BI - SF85P and Fingerprints 

All forms must be completed entirely and properly. The continuation form should only be used if the employee requires extra space. 

			(3) The employee must be fingerprinted as part of an investigation. Electronic fingerprinting can be performed at the University Drive or H. J. Heinz Division VA Human Resources Offices. Please call 412-360-6125 at University Drive and 412-822-3518 at H. J. Heinz  to schedule an appointment. These stations use electronic fingerprint machines which require the employee to fill out the Electronic Fingerprint Verification Letter on the VA's Security Investigations Website. If electronic fingerprinting is not feasible, please contact the local police department. The hard fingerprint card or Verification letter must be included in the same package with all the other forms when sent to the Security Center for processing. Do not send packages without the hard card prints or Verification letter or the package will be returned. 

			(4). When the entire package is complete, please mail it to the address listed below. Do not leave the package with a VA Human Resource Department. Please ensure when mailing the completed package that a traceable method (Fedex, DHL, etc.) is utilized. Allow seven (7) days for SIC processing prior to contacting the SIC Office. 

VA Security and Investigations Center
2200 Fort Roots Drive
Building 192, 07C3/NLR
North Little Rock, AR 72114 

Please feel free to contact the SIC at 512-257-4469 or 4490 or email vhalitsiccontracting@va.gov with any questions during this process. 

		(e) The Contractor, when notified of an unfavorable determination by the Government, will withdraw the employee from consideration from working under the Contract. 

		(f) Failure to comply with the Contractor personnel security requirements shall result in termination of the Contract for default. 

		(g) Upon Contract award, the Contractor shall furnish the Information Security Office and the Contracting Officer a list of personnel performing work on the Contract. The list will include a brief description of the work to be performed and degree of access to information management systems required. The description of the required degree of access will address if remote access is required. The Contractor will update and submit the list of personnel performing work on the Contract to the Information Security Office every year, throughout the Contract period. Furthermore, it is the Contractor's responsibility to notify the Information Security Office when personnel performing work under this Contract no longer require access to information management systems. 

(4) Government Responsibilities: 

(a) Upon receipt, the VA Office of Security and Law Enforcement will review the completed forms for accuracy and forward the forms to OPM to conduct the background investigation. 

(b) The VA facility will pay for investigations conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in advance. In these instances, the Contractor will reimburse the VA facility within 30 days of receiving the Bill of Collections.

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>HOW TO OFFER: </strong>The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future requirements.&nbsp; The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period&rsquo;.&nbsp; Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the &ldquo;Register to Offer Space&rdquo; link and follow the instructions to register.&nbsp; Instructional guides are offered in the &ldquo;HELP&rdquo; tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period&rsquo;**. For assistance with the application, email AAAP.Manager@gsa.gov.</p>

Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">** If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2015, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2016 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please be sure to review each page prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates&rsquo; tab in the AAAP.&nbsp; Your previous offered space will not be copied<strong>.</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

This notice is for information purposes only and is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.<br /><br />Project: FEMA/USACE National Hurricane Program, HURREVAC Operation and Maintenance for 2016</p>
<p>This requirement is for the operation and maintenance of HURREVAC from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. HURREVAC stands for Hurricane Evacuation and is a restricted-use computer program funded by FEMA and USACE for use by Government emergency managers to track hurricanes, support evacuation decision making, and provide data and information to support hurricane emergency management planning and operations. This real-time data analysis tool allows state and local emergency management officials to make prudent and informed decisions based on information developed during the FEMA Hurricane Evacuation Studies process and real-time forecast data distributed by the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Tropical Prediction Center/National Hurricane Center (NHC). The program was developed by Sea Island Software, Inc. beginning in 1988, in response to a need for computer based management of data produced by various federal Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES). HURREVAC has over 18,000 registered government users at all levels, and serves as the primary evacuation decision assistance tool for Emergency Managers threatened by tropical systems.</p>
<p>Tasks for this requirement include:</p>
<p>&bull; Provide and maintain 24-hour on-line Internet capability for receipt of real-time Hurricane Advisory files from the National Hurricane Center, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Wind and Storm Surge Probability data from the National Hurricane Center, and rainfall/river flood data from the National Weather Service on primary system and backup system. The backup system should continue to be a separate HURREVAC data-feed site using a separate data ingest receiver (satellite) from a separate city, and use a separate ISP provider/server.</p>
<p>&bull; Monitor all data feed to the HURREVAC program at both sites for errors in Advisories / Rainfall forecasts / River Gages / Wind Probabilities / Surge Probabilities/ other NWS products. If errors are found in data feed they must be corrected immediately. When watches / warnings are issued they must be entered by hand into data feed as necessary to guarantee accuracy for the proper operation of the HURREVAC program. <br /><br />&bull; Update the Help file and User Manual as needed to ensure it is up to date and accurate.<br /><br />&bull; Maintain primary and secondary backup personnel during the contract period that have full working knowledge of the HURREVAC program coding, data-feed coding, and overall system support and maintenance. The intent of this work item is to provide ultimate redundancy to ensure the program is always available and working correctly for users.</p>
<p>&bull; Upgrade evacuation data/clearance times from completed and updated Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HESs) and mapping plug-ins as new data is provided by USACE Districts or from other sources. Under this task the Contractor is also required to provide a list to the USACE that indicates if clearance times exist and if so, when they were inputted into HURREVAC for every HES study area. This list will be submitted in a matrix format.</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate with USACE to resolve all major problems, issues, concerns, or modifications and/or improvements to HURREVAC, and document actions taken.</p>
<p>&bull;Submit a monthly report summarizing major actions taken during the period, resolution and any issues.</p>
<p>&bull;Update all data (including previous year storm files and hurricane advisories) in HURREVAC to prepare for the 2015 hurricane season and provide technical support to users to assist with the installation and operation of HURREVAC for the 2015 hurricane season. Prior to June 1, 2015, the USACE will oversee a multi-agency collaborative testing and review of all data that has been entered in to HURREVAC to prepare for the 2015 hurricane season. The USACE will approve all comment resolution actions prior to execution.</p>
<p>&bull;Secondary backup personnel, including USACE and additional contractor personnel have been trained to have full working knowledge of the HURREVAC data-feed and overall system support and maintenance. An annual training/review of the operations requirements for the HURREVAC program is required for all backup staff. The development and execution of this training will occur prior to June 1, 2015. The training/review will be conducted remotely using a web based meeting platform. During the 2015 hurricane season, all backup personnel will be required to remotely operate and maintain HURREVAC for a 24 hour period.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 541519 and the standard size is $27.5M.</p>
<p>NO AWARD will be made from this SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Bronx VA Medical Center Research Department has a requirement for RNA Sequencing services to support research studies of the Bronx VA Medical Center.  The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to determine responsible sources that can provide this type of service, and to determine the correct set-aside to be used for the resulting solicitation.  The specimens that are needed to be analyzed by RNA-sequencing assay are prone to degradation at temperatures higher than -80 C, and should be kept frozen on dry ice.  Therefore, the potential contractor must be located in the New York Metropolitan area, allowing for the specimens to be delivered to the contractor by the VA personnel.

The method employed in these studies involves ultra-high through-put Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of DNA and RNA.  NGS is performed in specialized genomics facilities/ centers using specialized instruments.  The goal of this particular contract is to analyze RNA expression in 30 specimens using NGS. The method is called RNA-seq. The results of these RNA-seq studies will be used to gain a better understanding of gene expression abnormalities associated with mild blast-related Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), and to further identify biomarkers of TBI.

The VA will perform RNA extraction from 30 specimens.  The RNA samples will be delivered to the contractor by the VA.  The contractor shall first perform quality control (QC) analysis of the delivered samples using a Bioanalyzer.  The contractor shall then perform whole genome sequencing analysis (RNA-seq) for the 30 samples.  The sequencing shall be performed using paired-end 125bp method, as well as sequencing of small RNAs.  The contractor shall provide initial bioinformatics analysis of the data.

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, however; any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement to the contracting office no later than January 7, 2016 (4:00PM, EST).  Capability statements shall be submitted via email to the Contracting Officer at travis.gibbons@va.gov.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  The anticipated NAICS Code to be used for this requirement will be 541711.  A set-aside determination will be decided based on responses received.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Agricultural Library (NAL) in Beltsville, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures with the American Society of Plant Biologist, 15501 Monona Drive, Rockville, MD 20855, to provide electronic access via the internet for all USDA users to the Plant Cell and Plant Physiology Journals published by the American Society of Plant Biologist. NAL requires electronic access via the internet for use by all USDA employees, authorized public on-site users, cooperators, and volunteers working on behalf of USDA and acting within the scope of their relationship with USDA during the period of performance. Access must include perpetual data rights to the content.
<p>The circumstance permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) and 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or source will meet agency needs. The National Agricultural Library (NAL) is mandated (7 U.S.C. 3101) to serve as the primary agricultural information resource of the United States. One of its functions in that role is the acquisition of information in all aspects of agriculture and allied sciences. In support of this function, the NAL acquires journal publications in electronic format from publishers and makes the journals accessible to USDA employees and library patrons via the internet. In keeping with its charge to collect agricultural and related information, it seeks to maintain a collection of publications in various formats from a variety of publishers and sources. USDA researchers have demonstrated the importance of this journal content by their heavy past use of the electronic versions of the journals, made accessible by NAL's DigiTop service. NAL would like to continue to benefit from them. <br />The American Society of Plant Biologists is the only vendor that can meet NAL's requirement for journal access with perpetual access to the content issued during the period of performance. The American Society of Plant Biologists is the only copyright holder of its publications and thus is the only source of the access NAL seeks. Having perpetual access rights granted by American Society of Plant Biologists will give USDA users access in perpetuity to the electronic journals for which NAL purchases access. There is no source but the American Society of Plant Biologists for the electronic content of the subscribed publications with perpetual access rights. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 511120 is applicable. This is a lowest price, technically acceptable procurement.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Vendors that believe they can provide the services listed above are invited to submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>Veterans Affairs Network Contracting Office 6 (NCO 6) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Eagle Home Medical Corp. (DUNS: 867437279) pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and VAAR 819.7007.  The proposed sole source contract is for the installation of a 1" nitrogen line to an oxygen/nitrogen pad and the installation of a carbon dioxide tank manifold at the Fayetteville Health Care Center (HCC).  The work to be performed is related to work already in progress for the supply of medical gases to the facility.  VAAR 819.7007 authorizes the Contracting Officer to issue a sole source award to an SDVOSB without further determination that the SDVOSB is the only available source.  The facility has been open for over a month without the ability to perform surgeries requiring the use of medical gases.  The sole source offeror is capable of providing the required services.  Given the circumstances, the Contracting Officer has chosen to use the authority at VAAR 819.7007 to expedite the completion of the customer's requirement.  A portion of the requirement is considered construction, for which the magnitude of the project is less than $25,000.

<p>These Flow Cytometers located in F358 and in the Clinical Research Unit at NIEHS were originally purchased and installed by BD Biosciences for fluorescent analysis of cells at the single cell level. The instruments are comprised of multiple components and are extremely precise in the measurement of cell characteristics and populations and require specific technical support to maintain this level of precision. The impact to the Program's mission if Becton Dickinson and Company does not service these instruments would entail the instrument not being usable for scientific research for long periods of time, or being serviced with parts that are not genuine Becton Dickinson parts for these instruments, therefore reducing the quality and performance of the instruments. Becton, Dickinson and Company is the manufacturer and sole distributor of this equipment. No third party companies are allowed to service their equipment.</p>

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal; however, all responses received within 10 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is note advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Becton, Dickinson and Company.

<DESC>USACE, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Contracting Office intends to issue a sole source award to White Industrial Seismology, Inc., 1206 Schifferdecker Ave, Joplin, MO, 64801-3535. This is a procurement for technical services and additional seismographs for blasting if an emergency activation of the Birds Point-New Madrid floodway is required.
<p>The government currently owns seven (7) Mini Seis seismographs manufactured by White Industrial Seismology, Inc. These seismographs are critical in gathering data of blast monitoring during an emergency activation of the Birds Point-New Madrid floodway. It is crucial that the seismographs be fully operational during the entire time frame of activation; therefore, it is required that services be available on site to troubleshoot the systems and consult on location and best use. Since their systems are proprietary to White Industrial Seismology, they are the sole provider for trouble shooting and consulting services for best usage for their systems.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure from only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i). This will be a commercial acquisition per FAR 13. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation to the Contract Specialist by 12:00 PM CST, Monday, January 4, 2016. Interested parties may submit information for consideration by the government to: Allison.B.Hudson@usace.army.mil</p>

The monthly invoice for payment to the contractor shall be taken from daily invoices showing total pounds clean weight delivered for the month and the total dollar amount.</p>
<p>C.15. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY<br />1. The Government's primary quality assurance procedures are based on random sampling of the recurring output products of the contract using the concepts of MIL-STD 105D. Other areas will be reviewed periodically (i.e. Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annually).</p>
<p><br />2. The criteria for satisfactory and unsatisfactory performance is as follows:<br />a. THE REQUISITION SURVEYED BY SAMPLING: Criteria are derived from MIL-STD LO5D based on the lot size, sample size, and AQL for each contract requirement. When the number of defects in the contractor's performance discovered by the COTR exceed the allowable number defects, the contractor shall be required to explain in writing why performance was unsatisfactory, how performance will be returned to satisfactory levels, and how recurrence of the problem will be prevented in the future. In accordance with the general clause 52.246-4, "Inspection of Services", the contractor will not be paid for services not rendered in accordance with the standards set forth in this contract. The contractor is required to rework the services found by the Government to be unsatisfactorily performed. Because the sample represents the entire work requirements, the rework of the defects found by the Government shall not reduce the overall rating of that served.</p>
<p>b. FOR REQUIREMENTS NOT SURVEYED BY SAMPLING: The criteria for these requirements were derived from estimates of the level of performance experienced when the service was done by the Government personnel and are the level of performance deemed acceptable to the Government personnel and are the level of performance deemed acceptable to the Government. The use of the contract discrepancy report and nonpayment provision, as described above, applies to these requirements as well.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall be paid for all performed in accordance with the contract standards. Monthly payment will be reduced for unsatisfactory performance, using the following methods:</p>
<p>a. Each month contractor performance will be evaluated according to contract standards and acceptable quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP).</p>
<p>b. If performance in any required service is unsatisfactory, and the poor performance was not caused by Government action, or lack of action, an amount of money up to the monthly line item price times that percentage cost of the service as stated in column five of the performance requirements summary shall be deducted.</p>
<p>4. Monthly payment to the contractor will be reduced for unsatisfactory performance using the following methods:</p>
<p>a. FOR AREA SURVEYED BY SAMPLING:<br />1. Example of deduction computation using sampling surveillance. In a laundry services contract, the COTR would survey "wash formulas" as a single performance requirement for the performance requirement summary (PRS). Random sampling results show that the AQL of the 4% has been exceeded.<br />(a) Contract price per month for Laundry services $10,000</p>
<p>(b) Per cent total contract<br />Price for wash formulas x 10%<br />(c) Total price for wash formulas Per month $ 1,000</p>
<p>(d) Lot size = 450</p>
<p>(e) ) Sample size = 50</p>
<p>(f) Number of defects found = 20 (exceed reject level)</p>
<p>(g) Percentage of sample found Defective (20/50) x 40%</p>
<p>(h) deduction for services not<br />performed (line c x line g) x 400</p>
<p><br />2. Example of deduction computation for areas not surveyed by sampling: Transportation of laundry is unsatisfactory, when the inspection was made, five defects were found. Unsatisfactory performance is when four or more defects are discovered. Deduction computation is as follows:</p>
<p>(a) contract price per month<br />for laundry services $10,000</p>
<p>(b) per cent of total contract<br />price for wash formulas x 5%</p>
<p>(c) ) total price for wash<br />formulas per month $500</p>
<p>(d) lot size = 96<br />(e) AQL = 4%</p>
<p>(f) ) reject level (line d x line e) =4(round up)</p>
<p>(g) number of defects = 5</p>
<p>(h) defective percentage of transportation of laundry<br />(5/96) X 5%<br />(i) deduction for service not performed to<br />(line c x line h) $25</p>
<p>NOTE: When not using sampling, the deduction computation is the same as for sampling except that the number of defects found is divided by the lot size, not the sample size, to determine the percentage of service defective.</p>

<p>PART II - TECHNICAL CAPABILITY</p>
<p>The technical approach shall, at a minimum, be prepared in a format consistent with the evaluation criteria for award set forth in the addendum to FAR clause 52.212-2, of this solicitation. The Offeror shall provide sufficient detail (Capability Statement) to substantiate the validity of all stated assertions. To facilitate evaluation, the information contained in Part II should be specific, detailed, and clearly demonstrate that the Offeror has a thorough understanding of the requirement for the accomplishment of this offer. The Technical Proposal shall be a stand-alone document containing all information necessary for the Government to perform a complete technical evaluation.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide information within their technical proposal that covers the following areas:</p>
<p>I. Aircraft Wash Services Management Functions<br />II. Aircraft Tow, Wash, De-paneling Lubrication and De-paneling Services <br />III. Emergency Services<br />IV. Environmental Compliance</p>
<p><br />PART III - PAST PERFORMANCE: The contractor shall provide a list of no more than five (5) of the most recent and relevant contracts performed for Government agencies and commercial customers demonstrating that they have performed similar work in the past (within the last 3 years). The Past Performance will have the following information:</p>
<p>1. Contractor's Name<br />2. Contractor's point of Contact (email &amp; phone number)<br />3. Project Title<br />4. Detailed Description of Work (Performed by the offeror)<br />5. Contract Number<br />6. Contract Dollar Value<br />7. Period of Performance<br />8. Name of Contracting Officer or POC including information (email &amp; phone number)</p>
<p>The contractor shall have their customer on the list fill out the Questionnaire (Attachment 4) and have them submit directly to the POC for this Solicitation by the response date. Questionnaires received from the offeror, will not be considered/reviewed.</p>
<p>GENERAL PROPOSAL INFORMATION<br />Offerors are hereby notified that initial proposals which are found incomplete may be rejected without affording the offeror an opportunity to satisfy the requirement of the Government. Notwithstanding the information included in support of the offeror's technical capability, the contractor must meet all requirements of this request for proposal.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers: Best Value based on Performance Price Trade-off (PPT).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:<br />This is a competitive selection in which all evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price.<br />The Government expects to award one firm-fixed price requirements contract with one (1) basic period and four (4) 1-year option periods as a result of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions or make no award should no vendor prove to be an acceptable offeror based on the criteria set forth in the solicitation. The US Government will make an award to the responsible (IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulation [FAR]) contractor whose offer conforms to the solicitation and are determined to be the most advantageous to the Government considering price and non-price factors. <br />The Government will evaluate Part II, Technical Specifications on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. After all offerors have been ranked by price, the technical proposals will be evaluated for acceptability. If an offeror received an overall acceptable rating on the Technical, the Government will then evaluate the offeror's past performance. Offerors receiving an unacceptable rating for the Technical will not receive further consideration. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and other information required by 52.212-1 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate Part III, Past Performance on a level of confidence basis shown below.</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) the past efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.<br />Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving (Aircraft Corrosion Services) that involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's demonstrated past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no recent/relevant performance history or if the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably (neutral).</p>
<p>In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this Request for Proposal (RFP.)</p>
<p>If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced offer is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment, then the evaluation continues until an acceptable offeror is judged to have "Substantial Confidence".</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information instructed above. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports an unacceptable rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. At this point the Government will perform an integrated assessment to determine best value.</p>
<p>The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p><br />2. REJECTION OF UNREALISTIC OFFERS: <br />Any proposal which is unrealistic will be judged either as exhibiting a lack of competence or failure to comprehend the Government's requirements and may be so evaluated and rated, or rejected for such reasons. Furthermore, any significant inconsistency between the Technical Proposal and Price Proposal, if unexplained, may be grounds for rejection of the proposal. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly IAW its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the Offeror's proposal. Nothing in this paragraph is to be construed as a promise by the Government to conduct a price realism analysis where it would otherwise not be required to do so. The decision to conduct or not to conduct such an analysis remains in the sound discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The solicitation and subsequent award for this acquisition contains the clause at FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. This option to extend the contract term is evaluated as part of the initial evaluation, so that any resultant exercise of this option is within scope of the pending contract. The inclusion of this clause provides up to six (6) months of continued performance when it is in the Government's best interest to continue performance after the end of the final contract performance period. If conditions warrant the exercise of this option, the price(s) for the continued performance under this clause shall be at the same price(s) as the prior performance period.</p>
<p>PRICE: The Government will evaluate offers based on prices proposed for all CLINs and any other price<br />related factors required by the solicitation. The offeror's quote will be evaluated for Reasonableness and Total Evaluated Price.</p>
<p>1. Reasonableness: The existence of adequate price competition is expected to support a determination of <br />reasonableness. If adequate price competition is not obtained or if price reasonableness cannot be determined using price analysis, other techniques will be used.</p>
<p>2. Total Evaluated Price (TEP): The Government will utilize the following methodology to determine the TEP of each proposal. The TEP will be calculated for evaluation purposes only. The TEP will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>i. CLINs will be calculated by multiplying the proposed unit price by the corresponding quantity.<br />ii. The sum of all the CLINs evaluated prices will represent the total evaluated price <br />iii. Award will be made to the responsible offeror that represents the best value to the US Government.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITY: The following technical capability will be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. If paragraph I through IV are not submitted with the proposal, the proposal shall be considered unacceptable and shall be removed from consideration.</p>
<p>The contractor at a minimum shall present the understanding and show how to accomplish the items listed in section 1 of the PWS:</p>
<p>I. Aircraft Wash Services Management Functions The contractor shall provide a company capability statement showing how to meet the program IAW 1.1.3 of the PWS and show how to execute an effective foreign object damage control and prevention program IAW 1.1.4 of the PWS.

<p>IV. Environmental Compliance The contractor shall provide a company capability statement demonstrating knowledge of how to safely manage hazardous materials and which provides a history of environmental compliance IAW 1.4 and 1.5 of the PWS.</p>
<p>The following ratings will be used in rating technical capability:</p>
<p>Acceptable: Proposed clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation<br />Unacceptable: Proposed does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE: Recent and relevant past performance is defined as past performance having occurred in the last 3 years preceding the date of the solicitation issuance. Relevant past performance is defined as past performance providing candidates for services similar in scope to this requirement and complexity. The Government will consider relevancy, recency, extent of the past performance and the size and complexity of the past performance relative to this solicitation's requirement submitted by offerors as well as any information gathered by the Contracting Officer. Offerors that have no relevant past performance history will be assigned an unknown past performance evaluation rating; unknown will be rated as acceptable.</p>
<p>The government will use the following relevancy ratings when assessing recent and relevant contracts:<br />Relevant Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires<br />Not Relevant Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>The following ratings will be used in rating past performance:<br />Rating Description<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort<br />Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />No Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />Unknown Confidence (Neutral) No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>

The delivery ticket is considered the daily invoice and shall be extended to show daily dollar amounts. The monthly invoice for payment to the contractor shall be taken from daily invoices showing total pounds clean weight delivered for the month and the total dollar amount.</p>
<p>C.15. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY<br />1. The Government's primary quality assurance procedures are based on random sampling of the recurring output products of the contract using the concepts of MIL-STD 105D. Other areas will be reviewed periodically (i.e. Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annually).</p>
<p><br />2. The criteria for satisfactory and unsatisfactory performance is as follows:<br />a. THE REQUISITION SURVEYED BY SAMPLING: Criteria are derived from MIL-STD LO5D based on the lot size, sample size, and AQL for each contract requirement. When the number of defects in the contractor's performance discovered by the COTR exceed the allowable number defects, the contractor shall be required to explain in writing why performance was unsatisfactory, how performance will be returned to satisfactory levels, and how recurrence of the problem will be prevented in the future. In accordance with the general clause 52.246-4, "Inspection of Services", the contractor will not be paid for services not rendered in accordance with the standards set forth in this contract. The contractor is required to rework the services found by the Government to be unsatisfactorily performed. Because the sample represents the entire work requirements, the rework of the defects found by the Government shall not reduce the overall rating of that served.</p>
<p>b. FOR REQUIREMENTS NOT SURVEYED BY SAMPLING: The criteria for these requirements were derived from estimates of the level of performance experienced when the service was done by the Government personnel and are the level of performance deemed acceptable to the Government personnel and are the level of performance deemed acceptable to the Government. The use of the contract discrepancy report and nonpayment provision, as described above, applies to these requirements as well.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall be paid for all performed in accordance with the contract standards. Monthly payment will be reduced for unsatisfactory performance, using the following methods:</p>
<p>a. Each month contractor performance will be evaluated according to contract standards and acceptable quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP).</p>
<p>b. If performance in any required service is unsatisfactory, and the poor performance was not caused by Government action, or lack of action, an amount of money up to the monthly line item price times that percentage cost of the service as stated in column five of the performance requirements summary shall be deducted.</p>
<p>4. Monthly payment to the contractor will be reduced for unsatisfactory performance using the following methods:</p>
<p>a. FOR AREA SURVEYED BY SAMPLING:<br />1. Example of deduction computation using sampling surveillance. In a laundry services contract, the COTR would survey "wash formulas" as a single performance requirement for the performance requirement summary (PRS). Random sampling results show that the AQL of the 4% has been exceeded.<br />(a) Contract price per month for Laundry services $10,000</p>
<p>(b) Per cent total contract<br />Price for wash formulas x 10%<br />(c) Total price for wash formulas Per month $ 1,000</p>
<p>(d) Lot size = 450</p>
<p>(e) ) Sample size = 50</p>
<p>(f) Number of defects found = 20 (exceed reject level)</p>
<p>(g) Percentage of sample found Defective (20/50) x 40%</p>
<p>(h) deduction for services not<br />performed (line c x line g) x 400</p>
<p><br />2. Example of deduction computation for areas not surveyed by sampling: Transportation of laundry is unsatisfactory, when the inspection was made, five defects were found. Unsatisfactory performance is when four or more defects are discovered. Deduction computation is as follows:</p>
<p>(a) contract price per month<br />for laundry services $10,000</p>
<p>(b) per cent of total contract<br />price for wash formulas x 5%</p>
<p>(c) ) total price for wash<br />formulas per month $500</p>
<p>(d) lot size = 96<br />(e) AQL = 4%</p>
<p>(f) ) reject level (line d x line e) =4(round up)</p>
<p>(g) number of defects = 5</p>
<p>(h) defective percentage of transportation of laundry<br />(5/96) X 5%<br />(i) deduction for service not performed to<br />(line c x line h) $25</p>
<p>NOTE: When not using sampling, the deduction computation is the same as for sampling except that the number of defects found is divided by the lot size, not the sample size, to determine the percentage of service defective.</p>

<DESC><p align="left">The purpose of Amendment A02 is to add Section 283300 Vehicle Exhaust Gas Detection &amp; Control System to the Specifications. This section was identified in the Table of Contents, but inadvertently missed in the Specification package.</p>
<p>All other terms &amp; conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<br /><br /><br />Amendment A01 serves to change the Pre-Proposal Meeting Time from 1:00 PM on January 5, 2016 to 2:00 PM on January 5, 2016.<br /><br /><br />The U. S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a Buildout project at the Brooklyn Times Plaza CAX located at 594 Dean Street, Brooklyn, NY 11238. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $1,300,000 to $1,500,000 with construction completion within 210 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1) Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation.<br />(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.<br />(5) Company must submit information for a minimum of three to five buildout projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as buildout projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $750,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2, of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>Prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for inclusion in future solicitations in this area with similar scopes of work. There is no guarantee that a specific number of solicitations will be issued to these prequalified contractors.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON January 5, 2016 at 1pm EST. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>The SOLICITATION PACKAGE is attached to this posting.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Bob Ramba, Robert.c.ramba@usps.gov or Paige Lyne, Jacquelyn.p.lyne@usps.gov or Wendi Butterfoss, gwenda.b.butterfoss@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon on January 11, 2016.</p>

Upon award, the name of the successful offeror and the amount of the contract will be released as public information.

(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either? (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).

The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued under this clause.

(c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement. (d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order. (e) The Government?s rights to terminate this contract at any time are not affected by action taken under this clause. (f) If, as the result of the Contractor?s intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2) or 33.104(h)(1), the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs. In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of Subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between the Contractor and the Government. <BR> <BR>Payment requests must be submitted electronically through the U.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC><p>Questions and Answers:<br /><br />1 - Are contractors able to park shuttles at the TSA facility overnight? No. This is for strictly pick up at airport and drop off at hotel. And pick up at Training Facility visitor center and back to airport.</p>
<p>2 - Are there special certifications needed to gain access or operate at the Philadelphia Airport or the AC Airport for the TSA contract? Not on our end however you would have to go in the commercial vehicle lane. Please contact the airports to see if you need special permits for that.</p>
<p>3 - The Letter of Compliance requirement 6. requests the name of the Management Official, who will perform the work outlined in the SOW 2.4 ( Vehicle and Passenger Safety). Can this requirement be met by two separate individuals? Our company has a Safety and Compliance Officer and a Fleet Manager who collectively perform the tasks required in section 2.4 of the SOW.</p>
<p>Yes you may have two managers. <br />4 - Can a ride along with the current contractor be done?<br />No<br />5 - Are there passenger luggage limitations, i.e. no more than 2 bags per person? <br />There is not currently a limit to how many bags they can bring. However the classes are for no more than a week and the most luggage a student has brought was 2 bags.</p>

<p>14. Basis for Award-Offerors are notified that this acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.602 Streamlined Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, and supplemented with additional information included in the DOMEX Platform and Triage System Statement of Work (SOW). The rules, policies, and procedures of FAR Part 15.3 and DFARS 215.3 do not apply to this acquisition.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a single award Time and Material (T&amp;M) contract. This is a Small Business Set-Aside, NAICS code 541519, Other Computer Related Services which is selected for this acquisition. Proposals will be reviewed and evaluated to determine if the proposal addresses all areas of the National Media Exploitation Center's (NMEC) Document and Media Exploitation Platform and Triage (DOMEX) System Statement of Work (SOW) requirement consistent with the Best Value source selection criteria provided below and is compliant with this Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the program objectives, with reasonable price.</p>
<p>The Government will perform an evaluation of the non-price factors to determine the best value to the Government. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award the contract without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions. Offerors are encouraged to submit their best proposal from both a technical and price aspect, and not assume that the government will hold discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer determines them to be necessary. However, during the evaluation process the Government may, solely at its discretion, communicate with an offeror for any purpose such as to gain a better understanding of the proposal. The Government need not communicate with all offerors. Rather, the Government may, at its discretion communicate with only some offerors or only one offeror. As a result of such communication, the Government may allow an offeror to submit a proposal revision. Government need not provide all offerors with an opportunity to submit a proposal revision. Rather, the Government may, at its discretion, permit only some offerors or only one offeror to submit a proposal revision. If proposal revisions are allowed from more than one offeror, the Government may, solely at its discretion, impose non-common due dates for the revisions. In other words, the Government may elect to have a proposal revision date for an Offeror that is different than a proposal revision date for another offeror(s). At any time prior to award, including upon receipt of proposals, the Government may exclude a proposal from further consideration for reasons such as, but not limited to, non-compliance with instructions related to this solicitation or the proposal is not likely to be selected for award.<br />NOTE: Statements that the Offeror understands, can, or will perform the requirements of the SOW without supporting information or narratives are inadequate. Offeror's are cautioned that simply "parroting" the SOW in their proposals will not be looked upon favorably by the evaluation panel and may result in an unfavorable rating. <br />Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government may make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical features.</p>
<p><br />52-212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Security (Pass/Fail)<br />Factor 2 - Technical and Management <br />Factor 3 - Past Performance<br />Factor 4 - Price</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. <br /><br />Relative Order of Importance</p>
<p>Relative Order of Importance. The non-price factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>Factor 1 will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis. If an offeror does not receive a PASS for Factor 1, the proposal will be removed from consideration for award and will not be evaluated further. Factor 1 will not be considered in the price / non-price trade-off analysis.</p>
<p>The evaluation Factors 2 and 3 and sub-factors are ranked in descending order of importance. Factor 2 is significantly more important Factor 3. Sub-factor 2.1 is slightly more important than Sub-factor 2.2. The Past Performance factor will be evaluated independently from the other non-cost/price evaluation factor.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors. The rating for the evaluation Factor 2, Technical/Management factor will be based on the Government's determination of the degree to which the proposal satisfies the requirements of the factor. The highest possible rating is Outstanding, with the lowest possible rating being Unacceptable. The Past Performance evaluation factor assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror's ability to supply products and services that meet users' needs, based on a record of performance. The highest possible past performance confidence rating is Substantial Confidence with the lowest possible is No Confidence. The lack of relevant past performance information will result in an "Unknown Confidence" (Neutral) rating (i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable Price does not receive a rating. <br />NON-PRICE EVALUATION FACTORS/SUB-FACTORS <br />Factor 1 - Security<br />The first volume that will be evaluated is Volume 1 - Security.

Only relevant past performance efforts completed within the last 36 months prior to proposal submission, or work that is on-going will be evaluated. <br />With respect to relevancy, more relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance confidence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance. All past performance efforts rated as "Not Relevant" will not be evaluated for performance confidence assessment.<br />The lack of relevant past performance information will result in an "Unknown Confidence" (Neutral) rating (i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable). <br />In conducting relevancy determination, the Government will assign a relevance rating for each past performance references using the rating definitions of "Relevant" or "Not Relevant". Only past performance references deemed "Relevant" will be considered as part of the Government's performance confidence assessment discussed below. <br />Performance Confidence Assessment<br />Confidence<br />The Government will review the relevant past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to the performance confidence assessment. The Government will review past performance in the areas of Schedule, Cost Control, and Performance <br />The Government may use additional information that is readily available to the Government including both the information received from Offerors, information contained in the Past Performance Questionnaires, and information obtained from other sources. During the evaluation of an Offeror's past performance, the Government may query the Government agency references provided by the offeror. Other sources may include interviews with program managers and contracting officers, available DoD and other agency past performance databases and available data from previous source selections or contractor capability assessments. <br />Offerors are reminded that both independent data and data provided by offerors in their proposals may be used to evaluate offeror past performance. The Government does not assume the duty to search for data to cure problems it finds in proposals. The Offeror bears the burden of demonstrating the quality of its past performance. Offerors may be asked to respond to adverse past performance information.<br />In conducting a performance confidence assessment, each Offeror shall be assigned a Performance Confidence Assessment. The highest possible past performance confidence rating is Substantial Confidence with the lowest possible is No Confidence. The lack of relevant past performance information will result in an "Unknown Confidence" (Neutral) rating (i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable <br />Factor 4 - Price<br />The Government will make a determination to whether the price proposals submitted by Offerors are complete and the determination that a total price is reasonable. The reasonable determination will be based information submitted with the Offeror's proposal, comparison of other competitive offers, published labor rates, and the Independent Government Estimate. If required, other price analysis methods may be employed.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing. Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable proposal, the price of one or more items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of price analysis techniques. The Government will analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>Total estimated ceiling price to accomplish the requirement and all of its options will be used as a basis for evaluating price. The overall evaluated price will be the sum total of the Offeror's proposed base period and all option years plus six months after the last option period to allow for the possibility that the Government exercise the option at FAR 52.217-8. Offerors are specifically advised that, under this evaluation method, the Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices are unbalanced between initial and each option year. Each proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the government considers the proposed prices are not unbalanced, and are reasonable.</p>
<p>15. FAR Subpart 52-212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Attachment E) applies to this acquisition. Offerors shall complete FAR 52.212-3 and submit the completed copy with their proposal.</p>
<p>16. FAR Subpart 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions with its addenda applies to this acquisition. (See Attachment E).</p>
<p>17. FAR Subpart 52-212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues Or Executive Orders - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and additional FAR clauses cited in the clause are applicable to this acquisition. (See Attachment E).</p>
<p>18. Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) does not apply to this acquisition.</p>
<p>19. Contract Terms and Conditions Clauses (Attachment E)</p>
<p>This Section incorporates one or more FAR and DFAR clauses by reference that are applicable to this solicitation with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

<p>This Section also incorporates one or more contract FAR, DFAR and Agency local clauses in full text that are applicable to this solicitation.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Amendment 01 posted on 30 December 2015 corrects two instances in #12 above to correct that proposals are due 21 January 2016 and not 06 January 21.

<CONTACT>Smith, Ronald E.
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management, National Interagency Fire Center has an urgent requirement for Wood Shred Mulching in areas affected by the Butte Fire in Calavaras County California in accordance with the attached statement of work.  The work shall be completed within 75 days of the notice to proceed which is anticipated to occur on 1/22/16.

Vendors shall provide pricing for each unit as identified within the statement of work and a total price.  The unit descriptions and maps are contained within the statement of work.  Pricing for each unit shall be placed on this SF 1449 a total cost shall also be provided.

This solicitation shall result in a firm fixed price contract.  Evaluation of offers will be conducted by the contracting officer and technical team.  The vendor with the lowest price technically acceptable offer shall be awarded the contract.

In order to be considered responsive, and to properly evaluate vendor capabilities, all vendors must respond with:
1.  A completed SF1449 to include company information, pricing and authorized signature.
2.  A minimum of 3 past performance references where work of a similar nature was conducted.  References shall not be more than 3 years old.  If teaming or subcontracting major components to another company, subcontractor references must also be included.
3.  A draft plan to show how vendor anticipates providing the services within the 75 day period of performance.

Commercial item procedures.

Invoicing to be completed via IPP.

Questions concerning this solicitation shall be submitted in writing to the contracting officer, ronaldsmith@blm.gov.

-----------------------------
2 Questions have been submitted.

Q1. Can we receive the shape files for this project?
A1. BLM Mother Lode Field Office will provide the shape files at the Site Inspection meeting for those vendors who provide a flash drive. If the files are less than 24mb in size, BLM Mother Lode FO will email upon request the files to vendors beginning on 01/04/2016.

Q2. The Statement of Work states All treatment units require 50% coverage of evenly distributed material within the polygons to a depth of up to 2 (allowing for material spread overlap).  Please clearly define what 50% coverage means so that all bidders clearly understand what is expected.  Does 50% coverage mean 50 percent of one (1) acre will have some material on it or is entire acre supposed to be covered to a specific level.  If so, what is the level?  For example, 100 percent of the acre will have some wood shred to a level of one to two inches in depth
A2. 100% of 1 acre must have wood shreds on it. Because of the size/shape variations in the specified wood shreds, there will be portions of the ground that is visible by looking down on it. That percentage of visible ground cannot exceed 50% in any sample plot.
Weight of the material can vary greatly, so % of coverage was used as measure of acceptability. The specified material is generally up to 1-inch diameter. If 2 of those pieces fall on top of each other, you get a 2-inch depth. Most pieces are smaller and those landing on each other would create a greater density of material and higher percentage of cover

***********************
Updated 16 Dec 2015:

In addition to the infrared camera as discussed below, the FAA is seeking industry input on a potential replacement for the complete Long Range Sensor Suite System (to include IR camera, EO camera, and Pan/Tilt Platform) utilized in the northern border RVSS. The northern border RVSS currently utilizes the L3 Nighthawk HP Long Range EO/IR Surveillance System (see attached item/system description).  Any replacement system must be comparable to the L3 Nighthawk HP system in form, fit, and function.  

***********************
This is a market survey for potential replacement infrared (IR) cameras to be used in the northern border Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) in support of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.
   
At this time the nature of any potential competition has not been determined.  If a need materializes, the FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest, capabilities, and rough orders of magnitude from all businesses that are interested in and capable of providing the replacement RVSS IR cameras.  This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the potential acquisition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards for this effort:

NAICS		Size Standard
334310		750 Employees

The contractor will supply personnel and resources necessary to provide the required IR cameras.  The northern border RVSS currently utilizes L3 WALRSS HD IR cameras (see attached item description).   CBP and FAA are currently seeking industry input for a potential replacement northern border RVSS IR camera.  The FAA is seeking information and capability of both cooled and uncooled cameras for this application.  Any potential replacement camera solution will need to be comparable to the L3 WALRSS HD IR camera in form, fit, and function.     

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

The FAA requires the following (limited to 30 pages) from interested vendors in accordance with this announcement: 

1. Capability Statement - This document should identify: 
      - Type of supplies and services provided by your firm
      - Size and type of supplies/services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance)                                
      - Number of years in business

2.  Clearly state whether or not you can provide all of the types of supplies required. 

3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

4.  Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) or budgetary estimate for the replacement IR camera.

All responses to this market survey must be received by 4:00 p.m. CST, 24 December 2015.  The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following: 

Email: robert.lafollette@faa.gov

***********************
Updated 30 Dec 2015:

The closing of this market survey has been extended to 4:00 CST on 4 Jan 2016.

***********************
Updated 16 Dec 2015:

In addition to the infrared camera as discussed below, the FAA is seeking industry input on a potential replacement for the complete Long Range Sensor Suite System (to include IR camera, EO camera, and Pan/Tilt Platform) utilized in the northern border RVSS. The northern border RVSS currently utilizes the L3 Nighthawk HP Long Range EO/IR Surveillance System (see attached item/system description).  Any replacement system must be comparable to the L3 Nighthawk HP system in form, fit, and function.  

***********************
This is a market survey for potential replacement infrared (IR) cameras to be used in the northern border Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) in support of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.
   
At this time the nature of any potential competition has not been determined.  If a need materializes, the FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest, capabilities, and rough orders of magnitude from all businesses that are interested in and capable of providing the replacement RVSS IR cameras.  This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the potential acquisition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards for this effort:

NAICS		Size Standard
334310		750 Employees

The contractor will supply personnel and resources necessary to provide the required IR cameras.  The northern border RVSS currently utilizes L3 WALRSS HD IR cameras (see attached item description).   CBP and FAA are currently seeking industry input for a potential replacement northern border RVSS IR camera.  The FAA is seeking information and capability of both cooled and uncooled cameras for this application.  Any potential replacement camera solution will need to be comparable to the L3 WALRSS HD IR camera in form, fit, and function.     

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

The FAA requires the following (limited to 30 pages) from interested vendors in accordance with this announcement: 

1. Capability Statement - This document should identify: 
      - Type of supplies and services provided by your firm
      - Size and type of supplies/services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance)                                
      - Number of years in business

2.  Clearly state whether or not you can provide all of the types of supplies required. 

3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

4.  Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) or budgetary estimate for the replacement IR camera.

All responses to this market survey must be received by 4:00 p.m. CST, 24 December 2015.  The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following:

<p>The Work (GLAC 152999 Component B and C) includes critical health and life safety upgrades to Annex 2, the lobby and South Bridge of Many Glacier Hotel. This is a re-solicitation of both GLAC 152999B and GLAC 152999C projects into one contract. The re-solicitation includes elimination of many previous Bid Options, the combination of two projects into one base contract, and slight reduction of work scope from the previous solicitation package.</p>
<p>Component B:<br />Includes critical health and life safety upgrades to Annex 2 of Many Glacier Hotel. Work includes , but is not limited to complete replacement of: fire suppression, fire alarm, plumbing, electrical, and exhaust and ventilation systems; structural upgrades for gravity and seismic capacity, new slab work, repair/replacement of deteriorated or compromised structural members, fire resistance upgrades to architectural systems, select ABAAS upgrades, localized hazardous material remediation, and the removal/re-installation or removal/installation of new architectural finishes associated with this work. Due to the historic nature of this building, there are salvage, storage and reinstallation requirements of historic components. The majority of the work is interior.

Due to the historic nature of this building, there are salvage, storage and reinstallation requirements of historic components. The majority of the work is interior. The Lobby and South Bridge constitute approximately 32,000 gsf and include 27 guest rooms, 6 staff rooms, as well as public areas of the Lake and Lobby levels that will be closed for the duration of the work.</p>
<p>Project will be constructed under a single prime contract. The majority of the work shall be conducted between April 2016 and December 2016. The Contractor will return to the site approximately April 15, 2017 to continue minor remaining construction activities until June 2, 2017 when hotel operation begins and visitation arrives shortly thereafter. It is expected that all white box guest rooms, Heidi's Caf&eacute;, and the Hotel Gift Shop scope of work be completed by December 2016.</p>
<p><br />1.1 WORK UNDER OTHER CONTRACTS<br />General: Cooperate fully with separate contractors so work on those contracts may be carried out smoothly, without interfering with or delaying work under this Contract. Coordinate the Work of this Contract with work performed under separate contracts.</p>
<p>A. Concurrent Work: Government will award both projects for the Annex II (GLAC 152999B), Lobby and South Bridge (GLAC 152999C) approximately late January/early February 2016 during the winter shutdown. The two construction projects will be conducted simultaneously.</p>
<p>1. The Concessioner may have other projects running in other portions of the hotel, including, but not limited to, temporary renovations for relocated check-in for summer 2016, retail and snack bar area tenant finishes, Lobby room and specific guest room upgrades and overall maintenance activities. Contractor shall coordinate work with the Concessioner and their Contractors.</p>
<p>2. The NPS will have a design/build project at the Lobby to furnish and install the helical stair. General Contractor shall coordinate access and construction activities as needed.</p>
<p>3. The Contractor shall be responsible for the removal and storage (before construction) and the re-installation of all furniture and non-building equipment.</p>
<p>The estimated total price of both phases is between $10,000,000 - $13,000,000 including all labor, materials, equipment and expertise necessary to perform all operations required for the successful completion of the above named project.</p>
<p>Type of Procurement: It is anticipated that a negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal meeting is TENTATIVELY scheduled for December 9, 2015 at the Many Glacier Hotel (depending on weather conditions). If weather does not allow an on-site pre-proposal meeting, an alternative meeting location will be determined.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which, if submitted in a timely manner, will be considered. It is the policy of the government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns.

Brand Name Justification:  When brand name drugs are requested please check the applicable justification below:

r Within the Veterans Health Administration brand name drugs may be prescribed by physicians when in their clinical judgment the brand name drug will provide a better therapeutic outcome for patients.  Brand name drugs are requested when there is a clinical requirement for the drug or there is history of clinical requirements for the drug and inventory must be maintained to meet anticipated requirements.

*Is the requested drug available from more than source?  YES	NO l'7 (CHECK ONE)
If the answer is yes, you may skip to block 6.  If the answer is no, complete block 5.

* When competition is available three sources should be solicited when available.  However, when at least two sources are available the requirement will be competed unless adequate justificati on  is provided (see block 5).

5.   Client Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (check applicable block)

r- (A) FAR 8.405-6(b)(1) The requested drug will be purchased against a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract and only one source has the requested drug available on an FSS contract

r (B) FAR 8.405-6(b)(3) The requested drug will be purchased against a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract and an urgent or compelling need exists, and following the FSS ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. Delay in the award would cause patient harm by delaying the medical facility's ability to provide prescribed medications to patients in a manner necessitated by their plan of care.

p:  (C) FAR 13.106-1(b) The drug is not available for purchase on an existing contract and will be

purchased on an open-market basis, and only one source is reasonably available to fulfill the requirement.

If blocks B or C are checked, briefly describe the circumstances that make it necessary to purchase from one source in the space below (Block 9 may be used if more space is needed):

McKesson  Plasma  and  Biologics  is  the  only  distributor  with  which  we  have  an   active account and can supply the drug in time for target start of treatment date.




Statement of the actions, if any, the agency will take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for supplies and services is made: The medical center will purchase all pharmaceutical drug requirements competitively and fully utilize the prime vendor, national, and FSS contracts whenever possible. However, there are times that contracts sources do not have required drugs available and/or competition isn't available.  The Pharmacy Department will remove or overcome barriers to competition by adequately planning known requirements and pledges to do so before any subsequent acquisitions.
