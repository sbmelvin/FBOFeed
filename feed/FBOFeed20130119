<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure a commercially available Ultra High Frequency (UHF) 800 MHz Land Mobile Radio (LMR) System Distributive Antenna System (DAS) to support the safety and security communication requirements for a new Data Center (DC) campus. The LMR DAS will consist of a 3-channel P-25 Phase 1 UHF trunked system that will provide coverage inside five (5) two-story buildings on the DC campus. An off-air 800 MHz bi-directional amplifier (BDA) will be included to connect local first responders to their nearest dispatch center. The indoor coverage will be provided by a fiber DAS directly fed by the indoor UHF base station repeaters and the 800 MHz off-air BDA. Fiber Headend Units (HUs) will convert the radio frequency (RF) data from the repeaters and BDA from copper to fiber for transport to Remote Repeater Units (RRUs). The RRUs will convert the RF data back to copper and broadcast over an antenna. The DAS must be designed to establish seamless in-building coverage in each of the (5) DC buildings. <br /><br />It is mandatory for offerors to register with the System for Award Management (SAM) database with its associated DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) and CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code required to conduct business with the Department of Defense. <br /><br />This will be a full and open competition.

Award will be based on a determination of "Lowest Price Technically Acceptable". <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This posting is a synopsis notice only.

In accordance with FAR  6.302-1, it has been determined that only CDO Technologies,  5200 Spring Street, Suite 320, Dayton, Ohio 45431 is capable of completing this OEF requirement since this is a continuation of existing work they previously provided in Fiscal Year 2012 and can only be completed by CDO without incurring substantial duplication of costs and/or delays.
    This is an OEF requirement and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government’s requirements would be to the detriment of this project.  An approved Justification and Approval utilizing the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) is on file in the contracting office.
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capacity by responding to the requirements specific to this requirement.

The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents.
 Based upon the responses to this notice, the Government retains sole discretion to award and not compete the proposed contract action.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of follow-on contracts.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.
