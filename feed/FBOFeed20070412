<ARCHDATE>04112008
<CONTACT>Karl Lautzenheiser Contracting Officer 5032312052     Karl_Lautzenheiser@fws.gov;
<DESC>Sources Sought - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Portland, Oregon, has a requirement to obtain bare root seedlings for the Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge in Richland Washington. The only known native plant nursery that identifies the source of their plant stock is Fourth Corner Nurseries of Bellingham Washington.  Should no responses be received against this sources sought notice by April 17, 2007,  this synopsis action will be considered the notice of intent to procure subject requirements by other than full and open competition IAW FAR 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Technical point of contact is Heidi Newsome at (509) 371-1801 and Contracting point of contact is Karl Lautzenheiser at (503) 231-2052.  Applicable NAICS Code is 111421.  The statement of work for this requirement is as follows: Background: The Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge lies in the Columbia Basin Ecoregion of Eastern Washington State.  This ecoregion is in the "rain shadow" of the Cascade Mountains and is the hottest and driest part of the State.  Rainfall values for the area average 6" annually.  Temperatures often exceed 90o F during the summer, while winter temperatures hover near freezing, and have been recorded as low as -23o F..  Windy, drying conditions are normal for the region.  Soils are alluvial deposits from ice age lakes, and river channels.  Soils tend to be sandy, with little organic material, and do not generally retain significant moisture.   Due to these conditions, plant materials adapted to the site conditions are essential for restoration purposes.  Plant materials derived from the local ecoregion will have a competitive advantage during establishment and have a higher probability of survival once established, than material that is not from the local ecoregion. Plant Materials: o	Seed source for growing plant material should be Hanford, Columbia Basin Ecoregion, or Eastern Washington derived.  The Columbia Basin Ecoregion is defined as that area of land and associated plant communities that lie in and around the Columbia River basin of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.  Seeds that produced plant materials must have their origin in this area, unless otherwise cleared through the staff of the Monument. o	All plants produced must be source identified to the areas listed above. o	Shrubs may be grown as bareroot stock in nursery beds, or as container stock in 10" tublings. o	Plants must be a minimum age of 5 months old. o	Bare root stock will vary in age, size and height depending upon plant species desired please refer to page 2 for individual specifications for specific species.  o	Container stock roots should completely fill the containers o	Plants should be cold hardened for dormancy prior to delivery. 	The FOB is Benton County, Washington, at the U.S.F.W.S. office 3250 Port of Benton Blvd. Richland, Washington 99354. The approximate expected Delivery date is between 26 November and 10 December, 2006. 	Return of any containers/shipping cartons must be specified in bid with cost of return to be born by successful bidder. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR Native Shrub Plant Material Requirements Hanford Reach National Monument/Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge Page 2 Plant Materials continued: Species Specific Information: Red twig dogwood (Cornus sericea) seedlings bare root stock, 2-0, 18-36"  Black Cottonwood (Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa) seedlings bare root stock, 1-0, 18-36" Smooth sumac (Rhus glabra) seedlings bare root stock, 2-0, 18-36" Golden currant (Ribes aureum) seedlings bare root stock, 1-0, 12-18" Wax currant (Ribes cereum) seedlings, bare root stock, 1-0, 12-18" Wood's rose (Rosa woodsii) seedlings bare root stock, 1-0, 12-18" Pacific Willow (Salix lucida ssp. lasiandra) seedlings bare root stock, 2-0, 18-36" Coyote Willow (Salix exigua) seedlings bare root stock, 1-0, 12-18" Western Clematis (Clematis ligusticifolia) seedlings, 1-0, 12-18" "	Some species, ages, sizes, and heights can be modified to meet numbers of plants desired with approval by the staff of the Monument.  However, bidders should at least be generally confident that they can meet the desired quantities of each species (within +/- 250 plants per thousand) before making any substitutions.

<SUBJECT>99--Tower Simulation System - Sources Sought
<SOLNBR>5581
<RESPDATE>050207
<ARCHDATE>06012007
<CONTACT>Ryan King, 202-267-7851
<DESC>GENERAL DESCRIPTION: FAA has a requirement for the design, engineering development, documentation, production, assembly, installation, checkout and facility interface at the delivery site of Tower Simulation Systems (TSS) for the TSS Program. This includes the associated program management, training, Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) including the setup and management of a Training System Support Center (TSSC), as well as the requirement to conduct a Technical Refurbishment Study.  FAA anticipates that the Tower Simulation Systems will be available as Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) items.   The attached Draft Statement of Work and Draft System Operational Program Requirements document describe the needs and requirements of FAA with regard to this effort.  Also attached is a Draft Demonstration Scenario script provided as an example and discussed further below.   This acquisition will be conducted on a full and open competitive basis in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS).  SOURCES SOUGHT / INDUSTRY DAYS:   In an effort to provide interested vendors (herein after referred to as vendors) the opportunity to learn more about the TSS program, its requirements and the anticipated acquisition strategy for the effort, FAA intends to hold an industry day at or near FAA Headquarters in Washington D.C. on May 1, 2007.  This will be known as Industry Day 1.  Industry Day 1 will provide a forum for open discussion on the TSS program and give vendors the opportunity to ask questions and provide comments on the Draft Statement of Work and Draft System Operational Program Requirements document provided with this announcement.  Additionally, during Industry Day 1 FAA will discuss the simulator demonstration which will be required as part of the evaluation for the TSS requirement.  So that FAA may plan appropriately for Industry Day 1 vendors should respond to this Sources Sought announcement in accordance with the "Vendor Response" section below.   After Industry Day 1 but prior to Industry Day 2, FAA plans to release the solicitation for this TSS requirement.  FAA anticipates holding Industry Day 2 at San Antonio International Airport (SAT - San Antonio, Texas) on May 16, 2007, however this date is subject to change.  It is thought that the information provided both in this sources sought announcement and at Industry Day 1 will be sufficient for a vendor to determine its ability to compete for this requirement and whether or not to attend Industry Day 2.  FAA intends to provide in the solicitation a Demonstration Scenario script vendors will use to develop a scenario for use in the simulator demonstration to FAA.  The attached Draft Demonstration Scenario script is provided to give vendors an idea of what the final script may look like.  The purpose of Industry Day 2 will be for vendors to receive and collect information necessary to prepare for and perform the simulator demonstration.  At Industry Day 2 FAA will provide to vendors access to San Antonio International Airport which will enable vendors to gather sufficient information to develop a visual database for that airport which will be used to run the scenario for the simulator demonstration.  Vendors are cautioned that the investment of time, money and resources necessary to develop this database and later perform a demonstration of the scenario using their own simulator equipment is solely at the vendor's risk.  FAA will not reimburse vendors for any costs associated with the demonstration.   It is anticipated that all demonstrations will take place at the FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, NJ; however this location is not yet firm and is subject to change.  FAA anticipates that roughly six to eight weeks will be given from Industry Day 2 until the simulator demonstrations are to take place.   VENDOR RESPONSE: Interested Vendors should respond to this sources sought announcement by providing the items listed below.  Responses should be provided by 12:00 noon Eastern Time on April 25, 2007.   1.	Notice of Intent - Each vendor shall provide an email to Ryan King at ryan.m.king@faa.gov indicating its intent to attend Industry Day 1.   2.	List of Attendees - Included in or attached to the email, vendors shall provide a list of the representatives to attend Industry Day 1.  The names and titles of the representatives shall be provided.   3.	Questions/Comments - As a separate attachment to the email, vendors may provide questions and comments regarding the draft documents provided with this announcement.  Questions and comments from vendors are not required.  It is preferred that questions and comments be provided in Word format.  4.	Point of Contact - Included in the email, vendors shall provide the name and contact information of an individual FAA may contact if necessary regarding this procurement.  NOTICES TO VENDORS: NOTICE #1: Industry Day 1 will be held at or near FAA HQ in Washington, DC.  The specific location and time will be provided at a later date on the FAA Contract Opportunities website.   NOTICE #2: To be eligible to attend Industry Day 2 vendors must provides the names and titles of the representatives to attend Industry Day 2 not later than 12:00 noon Eastern Time on May 7, 2007.  This shall be done via email to Ryan King at ryan.m.king@faa.gov. NOTICE #3: FAA prefers that not more than six representatives from each vendor attend Industry Day 1.  FAA requires that not more than three representatives from each vendor attend Industry Day 2.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The TSS program is separate from the Air Traffic Controller Optimum Training Solution (ATCOTS) program.  The ATCOTS program is anticipated to move forward regardless of the activities of the TSS program.   This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of these services, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This is not a request for proposal.  The Government is not liable for any costs incurred for the simulator demonstration or the development of a written proposal. Additionally, the Government is not liable for any costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries or responses to this announcement and will not reimburse any firm for costs incurred responding to this public announcement or as a result of the Industry Days.

<DESC>On April 16, 2007, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) plans to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) to S&K Aerospace, Inc. of St. Ignatius, Montana, a tribally held Native American Organization (NAO), for a Moab Technical Assistance Contract (TAC) to provide facility technical and administrative support services at the former Atlas uranium-ore processing facility on the west bank of the Colorado River 3 miles northwest of the City of Moab in Grand County, Utah.  The Moab project site encompasses approximately 435 acres, of which approximately 130 acres are covered by uranium mill tailings.  The TAC contractor will provide services in support of the Moab Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMTRA) project.  The UMTRA project will relocate uranium mill tailings from the former Atlas facility away from the Colorado River to a DOE-constructed disposal facility near Crescent Junction, Utah.  For the remedial activities, a separate Remedial Action Contractor (RAC) acquisition is being conducted via a competition among DOE's Environmental Management Nationwide Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awardees (for information on the RAC acquisition, please reference http://www.emcbc.doe.gov/Moab/index.html). The Moab TAC solicitation is being made to S&K Aerospace, Inc. in accordance with FAR 19.805-1(b) and 13 CFR 124 authorizing the Small Business Administration to accept the requirement on behalf of a concern owned by an Indian tribe or an Alaska Native Corporation.  The resulting contract will replace the current technical and administrative support contract due to expire June 10, 2007. The period of performance covers a twelve month base period with four one-year option periods.  The contractâ€™s estimated value is $17.5 Million if all projected services are provided and all of the option periods are exercised.

<CONTACT>Wade Hillebrant, Contracting Officer, 208-526-0547, hillebtw@id.doe.gov;Janet Surrusco, Contract Specialist, 208-526-5477, surrusjk@id.doe.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID), intends to award a firm-fixed price, sole-source contract for commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 13 and under the authority of FAR 6.202-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements) with the small business vendor J. W. Bibler & Associates, 893 Honey Court, Arnold, CA  95223-3429.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is $58,000 for a period from May 2007 to September 2007.  The NAICS is 611430. From 2004-2005, the DOE-ID underwent a significant change in its management and operations (M&O) contracting strategy and structure to fulfill the need of overseeing the DOE Nuclear Energyâ€™s Idaho National Laboratory and the Idaho Completion Project.  This dramatic change necessitated a need to re-train DOE-ID federal employees towards a better understanding of both the revamped contracts and the federal role in administering the new contracts. Bibler worked with DOE-ID management and staff to: develop a contract management seminar series (CMSS) that would enable participants to understand the contracting environment; become familiar with the newly issued M&O contracts; understand the relationship between contractors and federal oversight personnel; and, become knowledgeable of the functions, duties, and limitations on the authority of oversight personnel at DOE-ID and DOE Headquarters.  Bibler & Associates performed two subsequent assessments to determine the extent to which DOE-ID employees have retained and are using the knowledge skills, and information obtained from the CMSS. In developing this training and subsequent assessments, Bibler & Associates obtained significant knowledge of: the DOE-ID; the Idaho National Laboratory and Idaho Completion Project contracts; the DOE Headquarters organization; and the interactions necessary to accomplish the DOE-ID mission. Under this award, the contractor will develop and present a refresher course focused on the behaviors, skills, and knowledge most important to the success of the major contracting activities taking place on the site, inclusive of the INL, ICP, and continuation of the and Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP).  In addition, an abbreviated version of the original CMSS will be conducted for new DOE-ID employees.  It is critical for the developer and instructor of this training seminar series to have intimate knowledge of: the DOE-ID organization; DOE-ID and DOE Office of Nuclear Energy relationships and authorities; contractual changes in the INL and ICP contracts; as well as FAR and DEAR changes that may impact these two contracts and the AMWTP; and, demonstrated expertise in organizational change and leadership and management disciplines. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification prior to the response due date of April 25, 2007.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements listed. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the award to J. W. Bibler & Associates.  Responses are due by April 25, 2007, 2:00 p.m. (MDT). Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to surrusjk@id.doe. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<DESC>SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR MIDS Flight Recorder, Fighter Qualified, P/N 1030090 to support B-1/B-52 bombers for Edwards Air Force Base, California. The Intent of Award is to ViaSat, 6155 El Camino Real, Carlsbad, CA;
 
The following is a description of the flight recorders:  

The multifunctional information distribution system (MIDS) flight recorder connects directly to the support port of the MIDS terminal without the need for a device to convert from the terminal?s AUI format to Ethernet.  It is a Link-16 terminals, including JTIDS Class 2s, FDLs, MIKS LVT(1)s and MIDS LVT(2)s , are used by the military for tactical communications.  A Support Port on these terminals provides a means of obtaining detailed information about the data exchanged.  In addition to recording all transmitted and received messages, the support port records data not normally available on the 1553 bus including transmissions originated by the terminal such as its own PPLI, initial entry messages, machine receipts, and relayed messages, as well as navigation performance data, signal quality measurements, and digitized voice.  In addition to the AUI interface, the flight recorder includes two 1 PPS timing signals inputs.  The fractional difference between these is periodically measured and recorded to facilitate correlating Link-16 data (time-tagged with JTIDS network time) with TSPI data (time-tagged with GPS UTC time).  The recorded data is stored on removable Compact Flash.  A software utility package is included which allows the test analyst to specify exactly what data is to be recorded (FIMSs, FOMs,DTBs, IDBs) without impacting the mission computer.  This software package also includes data extraction routines to support analysis of the recorded data.  


The flight recorder requires 28V aircraft power, weighs less than 5 lbs, draws less than 5 amps, and meets the following environmental specifications:

Responses may be sent via e-mail to Leonard.Buckless@edwards.af.mil or mailed to AFFTC/PKDD, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Leonard Buckless.  

Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>AFIT OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY AND ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY OFR COUNTER PROLIFERATION APPLICATION RESEARCH  

The solicitation number is FA8601-07-T-0032.  The proposed contract is for the purchase of post doctorate research in areas of optical spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy OFR counter proliferation applications which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1.  The proposed source is Dr. Guangming Li.  The services being purchased are as follows: perform laboratory work including atomic force microscopy as well as FTIR, photoluminescence, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry methods to correlate thermal susceptibility with surface properties of bacillus anthracis spores and other spores. The government anticipates a sole source award to Dr. Guangming Li for the following reasons:  Dr. Guangming Li is an expert in his field. He has worked to build a state-of-the-art atomic force microscopy and photothermal IR detection capability for AFIT. He has applied a variety of spectroscopy tools for AF problems, including FTIR, photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy. He has also demonstrated a unique capability to characterize polymers and bacillus spore surfaces using atomic force microscopy. Thus, he is currently the only person sufficiently knowledgeable of the specialized fields as required in this research project without 12 months of familiarization and is the only person qualified to perform the required task in the time frame required.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<CONTACT>Mary Hines 850-235-5389 , or Contracting Officer Mark Ross at 850-235-5624.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to BriarTek Incorporated, 112 East Delray Avenue, Alexandria, Virginia  to install and validate Man Overboard Indicator (MOBI) systems on 15 US Navy ships.  This contract also includes personnel training and the acquisition of 4,784 MOBI transmitters.  The objective of this effort is to outfit each ship with a system capable of alerting the crew of a man overboard event so that a life saving rescue can be executed.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  The USN has been evaluating Commercial Off The Shelf, Non-Developmental Item (COTS/NDI) Man Overboard Indicator (MOBI) systems since FY99.  Based upon results of multiple  Field Demonstration Tests, the USN has decided to purchase and install MOBI systems on all USN ships.   The MOBI system manufactured by BriarTek is the only system capable of transmitting a unique code that identifies the specific transmitte!  r that has been activated.   This unique code eliminates confusion during instances when multiple personnel are thrown overboard simultaneously and will aid in identifying which individuals are still in the water and in need of rescue.  Because of this unique code, BriarTek Incorporated is the only company that can meet all of the US Navy requirements.  Additionally, this effort is sole source because NSWC PC has awarded three previous contracts (including contract N61331-04-F-1131 and N61331-06-C-0004) to install the BriarTek-manufacuted MOBI system on approximately 200 ships thus far.  This contract is for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development and deployment of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Ther!  efore, there are no other sources that can satisfy this requirement. F SC Code: 6320 NAICS Code: 334220, Size Standard: 750.     The award will be based on an acceptable proposal on or about 12 Jun 2007.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure targated knock-in of a gene in the mouse genome. The goal of the work is to generate a mouse strain that carries a specific, heritable alteration in one of its genes. The task involves the application of gene targeting technology which is based on the process of homologous recombination to introduce the mutation into the desired gene. This is performed in mouse embryonic stem cells which are used to create founder mice carrying the targeted mutation. The mutation should be transmitted through the germline of the founder mice to allow generation of a colony of mice carrying the mutation for analysis.  Specific requirements are: 1) Expertise in the field of gene targeting technology and a proven record of accomplishment. The provider should have been successful for a significant number of years in this field. Evidence for proven success includes the publication of a significant number of successful projects in reputable, peer-reviewed scientific journals. 2) Proven experience in performing similar projects in embryonic stem cell lines of different ,mouse strain origin. This includes the option of using C57BL/6- or 129 substrain-derived ES cells, each with high probabilities of success, supported by evidence from publications in peer¬reviewed scientific journals.  3) Ability to perform the tasks within a realistic, competitive time frame for an important scientific project. The statement of work will provide more information.  All responsible businesses that are capable of providing the Government service  listed above may request a copy of the Request for Quote (RFQ) in writing or by FAX to 301-480-8501 to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.  It is anticipated that RFQ NIH-NIDDK-07-226 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of this synopsis.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  The anticipated award date is May 7 2007.  Request for copies of the RFQ must be submitted to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Two Democracy Plaza, Room 774B, Bethesda, MD 20817 or via email: griffinv@mail.nih.gov to the Attention: V.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>AIR WARRIOR ELECTRONIC DATA MANAGER GPS MESSAGE ROUTER The Government has a requirement for the award of a five year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for a GPS message router.  This procurement is structured in two phases.  The first phase will be awarded based upon full and open competi tion to select up to two contractors for the delivery of four (4) production representative hardware samples and functional demonstration software.  The intent of the Phase I effort is to promote competition through the delivery and initial Government eval uation of actual product samples. The selection criteria to be used in the RFP for selection of the two (maximum) winners for the current competitive Phase I awards are the following:  Technical (technical approach, technical compliance, and past performan ce); Price (price realism, and projected unit price); and Production Capabilities (contractor/sub-contractor management, configuration management, and production/manufacturing/quality control).  Only the two winners of this Phase I competition will be elig ible to submit proposals for Phase II of the GMR contracting requirement.  The Government anticipates awarding the Phase I procurement for firm-fixed price contracts to two offerors.  The hardware deliverables associated with this contract are for a commer cial-off-the-shelf (COTS) or modified commercial hardware solution to the requirements of GMR performance specification (AVNS-PRF-10824).  Competition for this requirement will be limited to contractors who satisfy the following three requirements: -- Contractor must be Free from Foreign Ownership, Control and Influence (FOCI). --Contractor must have a facility clearance of SECRET or higher in accordance with DOD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). --Contractor is required to have a COMSEC account established by the US Government. This requirement is specified in DOD 5220.22A, Communications (COMSEC) Security Annex.   The Phase II procurement is for a 5-year IDIQ production contract that will be limited to the offeror(s) selected for the Phase I effort.  The estimated total lifetime hardware purchases from the Phase II contract will be 6,000 units.  The Government will release a Phase II RFP with a production statement of work to the selected offeror(s) approximately 45-60 days prior to the specified delivery date for the Phase I hardware samples.  This will allow the offeror(s) to submit their Phase II proposal with the  delivery of the four GMR hardware samples required as deliverables for Phase I.  The RFP will require the offeror to provide pricing data to perform the production statement of work and provide GMR unit price data.  The contractor with the lowest price an d technically acceptable hardware, as determined through the performance of limited Government acceptance testing, will be awarded the Phase II production contract.   The release of the Phase I RFP is anticipated on or about 27 Apr 07.

Buyers and Sellers understand that FedBid ranks all bids by price; however, pursuant to applicable acquisition regulations and/or departmental guidelines, Buyers may use criteria other than price to evaluate offers.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s eCLASS project needs.  The HP DL380 G5 server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: •	Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management •	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health •	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks •	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives •	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers •	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) •	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting •	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives •	Systems must have front video/USB ports •	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources •	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  These servers will be supplementing the set of HP ProLiant DL380G5 servers that are already in use at the BIMC.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>A)	Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s eCLASS project needs.  The HP DL380 G5 server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: •	Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management •	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health •	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks •	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives •	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers •	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) •	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting •	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives •	Systems must have front video/USB ports •	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources •	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  These servers will be supplementing the set of HP ProLiant DL380G5 servers that are already in use at the KCC.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>A)	Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging.

<DESC>To promote safety and health for more than two million U.S. truck drivers, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has decided to initiate a new national survey of truck driver anthropometry.  This survey will be conducted in different regions of the continental United States. The research will focus on male and female long-haul drivers of Class 7 and 8 vehicles. The survey findings will be applied to the design of next generation trucks as well as to the updating of relevant industry standards.  The  recipient of this contract will be expected to successfully complete the following tasks: (1) review an existing NIOSH research plan and make recommendations on improving scientific rigor and practicality; (2) identify data collection sites, recruit and measure 1,000 -1,500 human subjects; and (3) develop a multivariate anthropometric model to guide the design of truck cabs. 

This requirement is being solicited as a small business set-aside.

The CDC expects to award a single cost reimbursement plus fixed fee type contract, and the period of performance is expected to be approximately 36 months from date of award.     

The complete solicitation document, and reference material, if applicable, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov on April 12, 2007 and proposals will be due on May 14, 2007.  No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>99--Tower Simulation System - Sources Sought
<SOLNBR>5581
<RESPDATE>050207
<CONTACT>Ryan King, 202-267-7851
<DESC>*** REVISION (04/12/2007): This announcement is revised to include Notice #4 under the "Notices to Vendors" section of the announcement below.  The attached Sources Sought Announcement is also revised. GENERAL DESCRIPTION:   FAA has a requirement for the design, engineering development, documentation, production, assembly, installation, checkout and facility interface at the delivery site of Tower Simulation Systems (TSS) for the TSS Program. This includes the associated program management, training, Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) including the setup and management of a Training System Support Center (TSSC), as well as the requirement to conduct a Technical Refurbishment Study.  FAA anticipates that the Tower Simulation Systems will be available as Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) items.   The attached Draft Statement of Work and Draft System Operational Program Requirements document describe the needs and requirements of FAA with regard to this effort.  Also attached is a Draft Demonstration Scenario script provided as an example and discussed further below.   This acquisition will be conducted on a full and open competitive basis in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS).  SOURCES SOUGHT / INDUSTRY DAYS:   In an effort to provide interested vendors (herein after referred to as vendors) the opportunity to learn more about the TSS program, its requirements and the anticipated acquisition strategy for the effort, FAA intends to hold an industry day at or near FAA Headquarters in Washington D.C. on May 1, 2007.  This will be known as Industry Day 1.  Industry Day 1 will provide a forum for open discussion on the TSS program and give vendors the opportunity to ask questions and provide comments on the Draft Statement of Work and Draft System Operational Program Requirements document provided with this announcement.  Additionally, during Industry Day 1 FAA will discuss the simulator demonstration which will be required as part of the evaluation for the TSS requirement.  So that FAA may plan appropriately for Industry Day 1 vendors should respond to this Sources Sought announcement in accordance with the "Vendor Response" section below.   After Industry Day 1 but prior to Industry Day 2, FAA plans to release the solicitation for this TSS requirement.  FAA anticipates holding Industry Day 2 at San Antonio International Airport (SAT - San Antonio, Texas) on May 16, 2007, however this date is subject to change.  It is thought that the information provided both in this sources sought announcement and at Industry Day 1 will be sufficient for a vendor to determine its ability to compete for this requirement and whether or not to attend Industry Day 2.  FAA intends to provide in the solicitation a Demonstration Scenario script vendors will use to develop a scenario for use in the simulator demonstration to FAA.  The attached Draft Demonstration Scenario script is provided to give vendors an idea of what the final script may look like.  The purpose of Industry Day 2 will be for vendors to receive and collect information necessary to prepare for and perform the simulator demonstration.  At Industry Day 2 FAA will provide to vendors access to San Antonio International Airport which will enable vendors to gather sufficient information to develop a visual database for that airport which will be used to run the scenario for the simulator demonstration.  Vendors are cautioned that the investment of time, money and resources necessary to develop this database and later perform a demonstration of the scenario using their own simulator equipment is solely at the vendor's risk.  FAA will not reimburse vendors for any costs associated with the demonstration.   It is anticipated that all demonstrations will take place at the FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, NJ; however this location is not yet firm and is subject to change.  FAA anticipates that roughly six to eight weeks will be given from Industry Day 2 until the simulator demonstrations are to take place.   VENDOR RESPONSE: Interested Vendors should respond to this sources sought announcement by providing the items listed below.  Responses should be provided by 12:00 noon Eastern Time on April 25, 2007.   1.	Notice of Intent - Each vendor shall provide an email to Ryan King at ryan.m.king@faa.gov indicating its intent to attend Industry Day 1.   2.	List of Attendees - Included in or attached to the email, vendors shall provide a list of the representatives to attend Industry Day 1.  The names and titles of the representatives shall be provided.   3.	Questions/Comments - As a separate attachment to the email, vendors may provide questions and comments regarding the draft documents provided with this announcement.  Questions and comments from vendors are not required.  It is preferred that questions and comments be provided in Word format.  4.	Point of Contact - Included in the email, vendors shall provide the name and contact information of an individual FAA may contact if necessary regarding this procurement.  NOTICES TO VENDORS: NOTICE #1: Industry Day 1 will be held at or near FAA HQ in Washington, DC.  The specific location and time will be provided at a later date on the FAA Contract Opportunities website.   NOTICE #2: To be eligible to attend Industry Day 2 vendors must provide the names and titles of the representatives to attend Industry Day 2 not later than 12:00 noon Eastern Time on May 7, 2007.  This shall be done via email to Ryan King at ryan.m.king@faa.gov. NOTICE #3: FAA prefers that not more than six representatives from each vendor attend Industry Day 1.  FAA requires that not more than three representatives from each vendor attend Industry Day 2.   NOTICE #4: In order to participate in this acquisition and to be considered eligible for award vendors must attend Industry Day 2. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The TSS program is separate from the Air Traffic Controller Optimum Training Solution (ATCOTS) program.  The ATCOTS program is anticipated to move forward regardless of the activities of the TSS program.   This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of these services, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This is not a request for proposal.  The Government is not liable for any costs incurred for the simulator demonstration or the development of a written proposal. Additionally, the Government is not liable for any costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries or responses to this announcement and will not reimburse any firm for costs incurred responding to this public announcement or as a result of the Industry Days. Until further notice all updates and announcements related to this procurement will be communicated via the FAA Contract Opportunities website (http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm) which was used to post this announcement.  Vendors are responsible for monitoring this website for updates to this procurement.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
United States Government Seeks Expressions of Interest for Leased Office Space in Houston, Texas, Project No: 7TX2031


REQUIREMENT:
The General Services Administration is seeking to lease approximately 45,658 rentable square feet of office and related space yielding a minimum of 39,703 usable square feet to house personnel, furnishings, and equipment including sixty five (65) reserved onsite secured parking spaces.  The Government is seeking Class A contiguous office space on the second floor or above without being split by a firewall.  The space must have the potential for efficient layout.  Public transportation and parking must be available within two blocks of the space offered.

The facility must be professional and prestigious in appearance, well maintained, of modern design, and of sound and substantial construction.

<DESC>This acquisition is for a firm fixed-price contract consisting of a base period for one unit. The base period will be approximately six months in length. The requirement is to repair and refurbish one empennage platform (hereinafter referred to as the tail stand) designed to service the tail components of C-5A aircraft.  The tail stand shall be brought to fully functional condition as per original design specifications.  The tail stand is a 70-ton (approximate), 70-foot tall, self-propelled lattice structure comprised of square tubing weldments.  The main structural members are four leg columns joined by bolting to structural fixed deck supports.  The structure is arranged to envelop the tail of the aircraft and provide six work levels, all connected by stairs and serviced by a 1000-pound capacity elevator.  The sixth work level provides access to the horizontal stabilizer.  Each work level consists of a fixed deck that houses a set of sliding deck panels that are manually pulled out to close the gap between the edge of the fixed deck and the vertical stabilizer.  The stand is also equipped with a 1000-pound capacity jib crane, a 1000-pound capacity traveling hoist on an I-beam, and four stabilizing jacks. The tail stand is supported by four two-wheel axles: two fixed axles are powered by a hydrostatic drive, and two steered axles are un-powered.  A 107 HP, 2800-RPM gasoline engine provides the power to drive and steer the stand at 2 mph in still air and at a slower speed against 40 mph wind. The nominal working pressure of the hydraulic system is 2000 psi.  When in position around the tail, the elevator, jib crane, and the hoist are powered through an electric cable from the hangar power source. 

The NAICS code is 332312 with a corresponding small business size standard (not to exceed) 500 Employees.

Evaluation for award will be Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPTO). Issuance of the solicitation will be on or about 27 Mar 2007 and will close on or about 9 May 2007.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Department’s networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/II’s eCLASS project needs.  The HP DL380 G5 server meets the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: •	Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management •	Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health •	Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks •	Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives •	Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers •	Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) •	CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting •	1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives •	Systems must have front video/USB ports •	Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources •	Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureau’s System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers’ servers indicated that these most closely met the DoS’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  These servers will be supplementing the set of HP ProLiant DL380G5 servers that are already in use at the BIMC.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers’ server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ yearly support and maintenance agreements.

<RESPDATE>042707
<ARCHDATE>04272007
<CONTACT>M. Hoyland; (703) 432-4912
<DESC>1.  This is a Sources Sought synopsis conducted pursuant to FAR Part 10 Market Research. This is for planning purposes only and there is no solicitation available at this time. 2.  This is an initial step in the planning process to assess market capabilities leading to the selection of a Product Support Integrator (PSI) capable of executing comprehensive near-term sustainment and selected engineering/logistics support for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle systems. The objective role of the PSI is to provide CONUS coordination of prime vehicle deliveries from up to nine (9) product vendors working toward an acquisition objective of 7,774 vehicles in three category variants.  PSI responsibilities include coordination of prime vendor shipments to the point of integration (SPAWAR, Charleston SC);  movement via USTRANSCOM medium to Kuwait, or Iraq; and final preparation and coordination of deliveries to receiving units supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  Within this framework are requirements to assess movement and sustainment coincident with prime vehicle deliveries to the operating forces; cataloging, tracking, and management o!  f piece parts, spares, line replaceable units (LRUs), and vendor-specific components across the entire supply chain; implementing complementary ordering procedures to support threshold operational availability within the OIF theater of operations; and to provide comprehensive vehicle maintenance, repair, and support in consonance with prescribed OIF operating procedures.  Critical in-theater support includes responsiveness to immediate maintenance and repair requests; supply support; asset visibility tracking and reporting; and coordination with supply chain stakeholders to ensure a cohesive operating model from point of origin (vendor facilities), through integration (SPAWAR), to receipt and distribution to operating units. 3.  Expected performance results from the MRAP PSI contractor include achievement of increased operational availability to a target of objective of 90% by reducing logistics burdens through supply chain efficiencies; reducing procurement and ordering time both in-theater and CONUS; centralizing life cycle sustainment management; and capturing relevant performance metrics that will reduce operating and sustainment costs to the Marine Corps. 4.  Firms capable of providing such a comprehensive capability are encouraged to respond with the materials specified.  Your response should identify your business size (large or small) in relation to the qualifying NAICS Code for “Maintenance, repair and rebuilding of equipment.”  Responses are limited to no more than 15-pages, although you may submit marketing materials via web link, or on CD-ROM as adjuncts.  Your response must address the following specific areas: 1) Demonstrated expertise and experience providing comprehensive end-to-end sustainment support for commercial and military systems at both CONUS and overseas locations;  2) Demonstrated ability to manage and coordinate vehicle system and heavy equipment movement; 3) Demonstrated ability to accomplish hardware component installations from multiple sources under a variety of operating conditions; 4) Demonstrated mature processes and automated capabilities for all facets of supply chain management operations, fro!  m ordering to fulfillment; 5) Experience in the management and control of storage, packaging, shipping and handling of heavy equipment and vehicle systems, or comparable commodities; 6)  Demonstrated knowledge and experience providing technical support (on-site and remote) for a DoD-system test program; and 7) Experience management of comparable PSI/PSP requirements under variable operating conditions including combat, or other adverse conditions.  Contractor personnel will require DoD security clearances at least at the SECRET level for key personnel, handling of material up to the SECRET level, and the ability to sustain SECRET facilities clearances at the operating locations.  5.  Your answers to the aforementioned questions facilitate discussion and influence the RFP.  They may aid in developing evaluation criteria for the upcoming competition.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION, IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NASA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this information, but hopes to compile a list of qualified companies who are interested in supplying the required services. This Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain information about Certified Welding Inspection (CWI) and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) services in support of the fabrication of the flight hardware for the Ares I-X Upper Stage Simulator (USS).  The USS is composed of twelve segments, often referred to a “tuna cans” because of their basic shape and their design for ease of stacking. The USS simulates the upper stage of the Ares I-X developmental Flight Test Vehicle (FTV) in support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Exploration Vision.       This is a Request For Information: NASA Ares I-X Upper Stage Simulator Certified Welding Inspection (CWI) and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) Services: The 18-foot diameter segments will be constructed predominantly from pressure vessel quality ASTM A516 Grade 70 normalized steel plate.   Individual segments are mated together along 6-inch wide flanges containing 180 bolts.  Flanges are constructed from six arc segments welded together with a double-V butt weld.  The body of each segment is composed of rolled 0.5 to 1.0 inch plate and is referred to as the skin.  The skin is up to ten feet in axial length and is constructed from two rolled 180-degree pieces joined at each end by a longitudinal butt weld.  The full circumference of the skin is welded to a flange at both the top and bottom using a full-penetration corner weld.   The NDE services being sought will focus primarily on the volumetric and surface (magnetic particle and visual) inspection of these three critical welds, dubbed flange to flange (F-F), skin to skin (S-S) and skin to flange (S-F), respectively.  Each segment will contain approximately 6 linear feet of F-F weldment, up to 20 linear feet of S-S weldment and approximately 114 linear feet of F-S weldment.  The joint configuration types requiring inspection are AWS D1.1 qualified weld joints, TC-U4b-GF, B-U2-GF and B-U3-GF, respectively. Additional fillet welds for lifting lugs, gussets, secondary structure and hangers will require surface NDE with acceptance criteria per AWS D1.1 Section 6. The site of performance for the NDE services involved in this RFI is Building 50 of the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, where eleven of the twelve segments will be fabricated.  Responses shall be formally submitted in digital format to the e-mail address of the USS Test and Verification (T&V) Lead Engineer below.

The contemplated Compatible C2 system would provide the service-oriented infrastructure necessary to provide a foundation for all future Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) satellite C2 developments. For the purposes of this RFI, C2 refers to the Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding (TT&C) communications with the spacecraft bus and does not include mission payload interaction. The Compatible C2 system would interact with existing operational C2 (and other non-C2) systems as necessary to provide the desired service infrastructure. If acquired and instantiated, it is envisioned that the Compatible C2 system would reduce the development time and cost of future C2 systems by leveraging the advantages of service oriented architecture and associated standards, tools and techniques. Reducing acquisition development costs and rapid integration of new missions is of prime interest to the Government. Reducing Operation and Maintenance costs (O&M) costs for multiple independent C2 systems is also a driving objective. The Government vision includes the possible migration of legacy C2 systems onto the service oriented architecture framework in cases where migration would yield additional O&M efficiencies for legacy systems, and the enterprise as a whole. Overall, demonstration of the framework’s ability to facilitate rapid integration of new missions at costs significantly lower than previous generations of C2 systems is essential.

3. To assist in determining the feasibility of acquiring a service oriented architecture framework that can meet these objectives, the Government is requesting information from industry. Interested industry respondents should provide a white paper that includes the following:

a. A business case that presents business rationale supporting a service-oriented architecture framework for command and control systems. The business case should reflect your understanding of C2 developments for government systems and the potential Return On Investment (ROI) of applying SOA to SMC C2 systems.
b. An overall feasibility assessment of meeting the high-level objectives stated above.
c. A discussion of how requirements would be allocated to the Compatible C2 system and how those requirements would reduce the requirements allocated to future C2 developments.
d. A discussion of the potential Concept of Operations (CONOPS) impacts resulting from the acquisition of a Compatible C2 system.
e. Provide a candidate technical reference architecture for the Compatible C2 system.
f. Provide a candidate high-level implementation roadmap that includes transition points.
g. A risk assessment articulating your understanding of the risks associated this potential initiative.
h. A description of unique capabilities and/or experience your company has with service-oriented architecture frameworks. Particular application to command and control systems would be a plus.
i. Discuss the potential for migrating legacy C2 systems onto the Compatible C2 system, and the potential advantages of doing so.
j. A discussion of potential services that lend themselves to the C2 arena
k. Responses to the questions below.


4. The Government will use this information to help assess the feasibility of a Compatible C2 acquisition, and to assist in developing a potential acquisition strategy. Based on the results of the RFI, SELECT respondents will be invited to participate in an industry day to discuss the information in greater detail. The facility location and date of the industry day are forthcoming in a future announcement. A response to this RFI is required to be considered for participation in the industry day. However, failure to respond to the RFI does not preclude proposal submittal should a formal acquisition be announced. The Small Business coordination number is 07-35. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges, and minority institutions.  

5. Respondents should provide a non-proprietary response to this RFI. If proprietary material is deemed essential, all proprietary information should be provided in a separate addendum to the non-proprietary response, and clearly marked accordingly.  All responses must be signed, then scanned, then submitted by email in Microsoft Word or PDF format. The Government may not accept company literature or marketing materials. Responses are limited to twenty-five (25) pages in length, and font size should not be smaller than 12 pt font. Please use the space available to provide sound systems engineering inputs that satisfy the Government’s objectives and requests. The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.  

6. The Government requests that respondent’s deliver one (1) electronic soft copy no later than 04 May 2007 and (1) written/hard copy. Electronic copy should be in either PDF format or Microsoft Word format.  All communication associated with this RFI shall be directed to the Government Contracting Office via email.

<DESC>The US Department of Education, Office of Information Officer, requires eRoom Maintenance software. 

NOTICE OF INTENDED SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE to:

Vendor - 
EMC Corporation 
8444 Westpark Dr
McLean, VA 22102-2510

The US Department of Education (ED), Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO) requires a vendor to provide eRoom Maintenance renewal support. 

See requirements document uploaded separately under this reference number.  It contains the description, quantity and start and end dates for the 12 line items under this requirement.

eRooms Software is used for collaboration with various offices in the Department of Education. The Department uses eRoom as a collaboration tool to coordinate various activities between the The Department and state and federal educational agencies. The Department had reviewed documentation provided by a research and analysis firm on 5 collaboration software tools. The Department conducted extensive market research and selected the best tool for the Department. Two software packages met the Department's standard requirements (i.e. technical requirements, 508 compliance, security, interoperability with network environment and standard tools), and then the Department narrowed it down to one software package, E Rooms, for interoperability and feasibility reasons. 

eRooms was selected by The Department in 2002 and if a new product was purchased it would be costly because new licenses, maintenance, and training would need to be purchased in order to use the software. The Department does not intend to purchase another collaboration tool for at least another two years.

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotations.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, all quotations received by the posted response date will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This request does not commit the U.S. Department of Education to award any purchase order, to pay any costs incurred related to quotations or subsequent negotiations, if any.  It is also the Offeror's responsibility to inform the US Department of Education of any present, pending or possible future conflicts of interest.

<DESC>Pending the availability of funding, The US Department of Education intends to issue a sole source purchase order to ViaSim.  ED began in February 2007 to review the current Federal student financial assistance program structure and consider possible alternatives. This process involved extensive consultations with a broad array of student aid experts. It has produced a wide range of alternative approaches for consideration by ED policy officials.  As part of ED's review of these alternatives, ViaSim produced a high-level simulation that captures the current program structure.  The purpose of this new Purchase Order is to enhance the details and robustness of the simulation in order to allow ED policymakers to assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of the various proposals in detail.  This purchase order is a total small business set-aside.  The Department intends to execute this purchase order on or before April 19, 2006.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Request for Information on Manufacturing Capabilities, Surge Capacity, New Product/New Technology Development for Respiratory Protection Device during Pandemic Influenza Outbreaks
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-OPHEMC-07-01
<RESPDATE>051807
<CONTACT>Paquetta  Myrick-Hancock, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 260-0534, Fax (202) 205-4520, Email Paquetta.Hancock@hhs.gov
<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The National Pandemic Influenza Plan (Nov. 1, 2005) designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness. Following the issuance of the HHS Pandemic Plan of 2005, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) was charged with gathering information, developing policies and issuing recommendations on specific medical countermeasures (e.g., stockpile acquisitions) that may be used to contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with influenza pandemics in the United States. The Office of Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures (OPHEMC) in ASPR is responsible for the tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these pandemic medical countermeasures. This is a Request for Information (RFI) on current manufacturing capabilities and new technology development for respiratory protection devices that might be used in the event of a pandemic influenza outbreak.  It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.


*** OBJECTIVE *** During an influenza pandemic the need for respiratory protection devices may increase significantly. To meet an increased demand, the existing supply and baseline production capacity of respiratory protection devices in the U.S. may need to expand, and the capability to increase production in the time of actual emergency (i.e., surge capacity) may require enhancement. This is potentially achievable by expanding existing manufacturing facilities, erecting new manufacturing facilities, converting existing manufacturing plants and/or stockpiling respiratory protection devices. To better understand these issues and formulate specific recommendations, HHS/ASPR/OPHEMC is requesting information on manufacturing capabilities for specific respiratory devices. HHS/ASPR/OPHEMC is also interested in new technologies or devices under development that are relevant to respiratory protection during an influenza pandemic. For the purpose of this RFI, HHS/ASPR/OPHEMC distinguishes between the following categories of devices:  

Category 1 - National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified (42 CFR Part 84) N95 filtering face-piece respirators that have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health for medical use  (FDA-cleared); 
Category 2 - NIOSH-certified N95 filtering face-piece respirators that have not been cleared by the FDA (i.e. are currently marketed for non-medical use;

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of StoneGate Equipment and Maintenance.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the StoneGate product as a key component of the Department’s core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet. The equipment listed above is required due to the expansion of the ONE program throughout the Department of State.  The firewalls will aid in the process of filtering out harmful web content and/or malicious code on the Department of State’s mission critical operating environment. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s core firewall infrastructure.<BR><BR>

BRAND NAME ONLY JUSTIFICATION:  The USAF Academy, Department of Chemistry has a Brand Name Only requirement to procure a Thermo Electron Model Evolution RC Centrifuge that will be utilized using existing rotors in their current inventory.  This acquisition is to replace a low speed centrifuge with a high speed centrifuge that utilizes the same rotors.  All the rotors used in the equipment in the biochemistry lab are interchangeable, so it is necessary to purchase the same brand name product as a replacement.  The Thermo Electron model Evolution RC Centrifuge meets all below-stated requirements and is therefore the instrument of choice for a BRAND NAME purchase by the United States Air Force Academy Department of Chemistry.   BRAND NAME purchase of a One (1) Thermo Electron model Evolution RC Centrifuge that will be used in all biochemistry lab courses, Chem 440, Polymer Chemistry, Chem 465, Material Science and Chem 499 Independent Research:  Specifications must be able to meet the following criteria:  A. The Air Force Academy, Department of Chemistry currently has four centrifuge rotors with a value of approximately $20,000 that operate in a Thermo Electron (previously Sorvall) Instruments.  B. The centrifuge system must be able to reach a max speed of 26,000 RPM without the use of a vacuum pump.  C. The centrifuge system must have at least a 3.5 hp motor and 2.0 hp compressor for maximum performance and to accelerate large volume rotors more quickly.  D. The centrifuge system must have a strong, imbalance-tolerant drive system including a brush-less motor design that provides a gyro that flexes in two places to accommodate any misalignment or imbalance.  This capability will compensate for balance errors and protect the equipment from severe damage. E. The centrifuge system must contain heating and cooling capability, providing quick temperature response and superior temperature control. F. The centrifuge system must contain a built-in electrical management system to ensure peak instrument performance, even under poor power supply condition. System must accept input voltage varying from 187-253 volts without speed or temperature control degradation.  G. The centrifuge system must have a “lift over” profile no greater than 33 inches. This ergonomic feature provides a safe working height for instrument users. H. The centrifuge system must be extremely easy to load and clean, with a retractable chamber door that slides completely out of the way.  The centrifuge must have “hands-free” access to the rotor chamber. I. The centrifuge system must have an integrated rotor lid holder to facilitate access to samples. J. The centrifuge system must have a 6 liter rotor that is bio-contained and does not require additional canisters. K. The centrifuge system must have multiple slow-start/slow-stop features to prevent gradient disturbance during acceleration and deceleration. L. The centrifuge system must have an easily accessible RCF (Relative Centrifugal Force) feature that automatically calculates and displays the corresponding RCF value for any selected rotor and speed setting. M.  The centrifuge must accept “system integrated” SUPER-LITE™ Composite and SUPER-LITE™ aluminum rotors allowing for faster acceleration and deceleration times, with accurate temperature control.  No canisters or additional subassemblies should be required. N.  The centrifuge system must come with a standard warranty of one (1) year on the instrument, three (3) years on the drive and five (5) years on the refrigeration.  (None will be prorated.)

Completion of the Linen Listing:  Provide a price for every item listed in rows 1 through 23.  The quantity on some of the items is zero (0).  A zero indicates that the commissary is not currently requiring that particular item; however, offerors are required to enter a unit price for every item on the list.  After award, the prices entered for zero quantity items will be effective for any future additional requirements requested by the commissary.  The zero quantity items will not be used in the evaluation process (however, un-balanced pricing will not be allowed).  
Provide a price for each performance period (base and all options) for a location.  If your company charges an environmental fee, enter the weekly fee in row 24.  
If your company charges an energy surcharge during periods of high energy costs, enter the applicable percentage rate in row 27.  The percentage rate will be applicable to the rental total for the week. 
 In row 28, enter the percentage rate for the weekly lost/damage fee.  The lost/damaged replacement fee will fund the replacement costs for items lost or damaged by commissary personnel.  The rate will be applied to the total rental fee, excluding environmental fee and energy surcharge, if applicable.  The fee will eliminate the need for billing for individual items and for reconciliation of lost/damaged items at the end of the contract. 
 In row 30, enter the cost to attach one organization patch (provided by the Government) to one garment in the “Miscellaneous Garment Preparation and Repair”.  If the offeror does not charge for garment preparation, enter ‘0’.  The cost to attach one organization patch to one garment will be multiplied by the total number of upper body garments required for that location.  
If a price is not entered for lines 1-30 described above, it will be assumed the item or service will be provided without charge for that item.  The resulting total dollar amount for each CLIN on the Linen Listing must be entered into the corresponding CLIN.  The associated CLIN Number can be found at the top of the Linen Listing.  EXTENSIONS IN PRICING WILL BE CORRECTED.  ITEM UNIT COST LISTED IN THE LINEN LISTING WILL PREVAIL.

The contractor is advised that the Government will contact the references provided; therefore, the references should be knowledgeable of the offeror’s performance on that contract.  In order to be considered for award, offeror must provide a price for all contract line items.  Award will be made to the lowest responsible offeror whose quote is the lowest in the aggregate for all line items.  All elements of a line item must be completed in order for a quote to be considered for award.  Quotation must include a signed STATEMENT specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and acknowledge all amendments to the solicitation (as applicable).

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror or offerors using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Quotations shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:  Factor 1 – Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government’s requirement and Factor 2 – Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a “go/no go” basis. If a quotation has been determined to be a “go” on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror’s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quotation evaluated for the lowest price.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorable on past performance.

1.  Factor 1 – Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government’s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of  descriptive literature and any other information required to clearly indicate that the offeror is proposing and will be providing the batteries in accordance with all stated characteristics located in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.  

“Descriptive literature” means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quotation.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the product which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

2.  Factor 2 – Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror’s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror’s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror’s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quotation will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

In evaluating an offeror’s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror’s quotation and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products under an indefinite delivery type arrangement.  

The offeror shall provide: 
a.	A list of contracts, preferably three, commercial or government that have been performed within the last five (5) years.  This list shall include:  point of contact, address, telephone 
number, dollar amount of contract, performance schedule and a brief description of the services provided.
b.	A list of any “significant problems” encountered for the contracts reported in response to paragraph (a) above.  General examples are:  shortages, overages, damage and misshipments.  Include also a brief description concerning how these problems were handled and remedied.
    
References may be contacted as part of the evaluation process.

3.  Price
If a quotation has been determined technically acceptable, the Government will then evaluate the quotation for the lowest price.  

The Contracting Officer has determined that there is a high probability of adequate price competition for this acquisition.  Upon examination of initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer’s opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required.  However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price.

Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all quotations.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.			

4. Complete the following Certifications and/or ORCA

52.233-9000 Agency Protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity’s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
 (a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel ( see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [  ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.  
NOTE:  All contractors MUST accept Government VISA Purchase Card.

All responsible 8(a) business concerns may submit a quotation that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

Quotation due date and time is April 25, 2007 – 2:00 PM local ti

FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (a)  The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror or offerors using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.  Quotations shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:  Factor 1 – Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government’s requirement and Factor 2 – Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a “go/no go” basis. If a quotation has been determined to be a “go” on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror’s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quotation and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quotation evaluated for the lowest price.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorable on past performance.

1.  Factor 1 – Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government’s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of  descriptive literature and any other information required to clearly indicate that the offeror is proposing and will be providing the refrigeration recovery unit in accordance with all stated characteristics located in the Schedule of Supplies/Services.  

“Descriptive literature” means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quotation.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered that specified elsewhere in the solicitation and pertain to significant elements such as (1) design, (2) materials, (3) components, (4) performance characteristics and (5) methods of manufacture, assembly, construction or operation.  The term includes only information required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Descriptive literature must be (1) identified to show the product which it applies and (2) received by the date and time specified in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  

2.  Factor 2 – Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror’s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror’s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror’s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quotation will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

In evaluating an offeror’s past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offeror’s quotation and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms, and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

The information provided should reflect similar type contracts for the same or similar type products under an indefinite delivery type arrangement.  

The offeror shall provide: 
a.	A list of contracts, preferably three, commercial or government that have been performed within the last five (5) years.  This list shall include:  point of contact, address, telephone 
number, dollar amount of contract, performance schedule and a brief description of the services provided.
b.	A list of any “significant problems” encountered for the contracts reported in response to paragraph (a) above.  General examples are:  shortages, overages, damage and misshipments.  Include also a brief description concerning how these problems were handled and remedied.
    
References may be contacted as part of the evaluation process.

3.  Price
If a quotation has been determined technically acceptable, the Government will then evaluate the quotation for the lowest price.  

The Contracting Officer has determined that there is a high probability of adequate price competition for this acquisition.  Upon examination of initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if, in the Contracting Officer’s opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required.  However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price.

Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all quotations.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The following DLAD provisions are hereby added in full text:

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests.
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity’s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

NOTE:  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database to receive an award.  Information on registration may be obtained calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.bpn.gov.  

NOTE:  All contractors MUST furnish a product of a small business manufacturer.

All responsible small business concerns may submit a quotation that shall be considered by this agency.  In order to be eligible for award, a Contractor must be determined to be responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104.

While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of quotes, the final award decision will be based on Price and Past Performance with Past Performance being more important than Price.

The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest quoter.  The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information concerning its most relevant three contracts that have been performed within the past three years for efforts that are similar to the Statement of Work (SOW) contained herein, to include only the name and address of the organization for which the effort was supplied, and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.  

Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.  Quoters shall include a completed copy of 52.212-3 ALT I with their quotes.  This announcement will close at 1600 EST on 26 April 2007.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:   

The intent of this competitive solicitation is to select multiple firms to perform plumbing, mechanical, and electrical, General Contractor discipline construction work and minor design services for various Indian Health Service Facilities in New Mexico as needed.

Phase I will be a competitive evaluation of the firms past performance history and qualifications. Each of these firms will be evaluated and rated and ranked by a source selection board. Up to five firms may be selected and requested to participate in Phase II.   

Phase II will be for the seed project and will involve minor design and may include, utilities and other infrastructure, mechanical engineering for building plumbing and HVAC systems, electrical engineering for building systems and site lighting, and any and all other incidental architectural and engineering tasks as required for a complete project.

The Indian Health Service will provide minimum specification and drawing packages to the selected contractors which shall be used as minimum requirements. The contractor’s will be required to design a complete building package providing the most amenities possible within the budgeted funds available conforming to the drawings and specification.  The estimated project size is in excess of $100,000.00 dollars for both design and construction. Some projects may be higher limits and some projects may be lower limits. Not all projects will require design efforts.  Pricing will be established as designing within fee limitations and the final construction lump sum price will be negotiated.  

Award of the seed project will be made to one firm whose proposal, conforming to the requirements is determined to offer the best value to the Government, price, technical factors, and past performance considered.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price offeror. 

As the need develops, each of the five firms will be issued minimum plans and specifications and requested to submit a technical and price proposal. Again, award will be made to the offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to offer the best value to the Government, price, technical factors, and past performance considered. 

There is no guarantee as to the amount of work a contractor will receive during the term of the contract. Each project will be a competitive negotiated procurement therefore contractors must submit their most favorable prices.

Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the proposed contract.  Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussion.  In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(I)	Technical Capability of Proposed Item to Meet Requirements.
(II)	Past Experience and/ or performance.
(III)	Delivery Item on time frame specified.
(IV)	Price
Applicant's Proposal will be evaluated first under Factor (i) which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria. Under this factor, applicant's proposal will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.
Only those proposals which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii), (iii) and (iv). In the second step of evaluating those proposals under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is significantly less important than Factor (i). In the third step of evaluation those proposals under Factor (i) and (ii) to be technically acceptable, Factor (iii) is significantly less important than Factor (ii). In the fourth step of evaluation those proposals under Factor (i),(ii) and (iii) to be technically acceptable, Factor (iv) is significantly less important than Factor (iii).
a)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted. Submitted proposals technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 

b)  A proposal that receives a rating of acceptable on past performance is one that demonstrates little anticipated risk in the areas of quality of the product, and customer satisfaction.  Submitted proposals should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate acceptable past performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 

The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies and subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement.   

(II) PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided as an attachment to the quote.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  

Proposals that lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any submitted proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Thus, the Contracting Officer may determine it is an unsuccessful proposal when compared to others proposals.

Submitted proposals will be evaluated for PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:
NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation. Applicant's proposal has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon applicant's proposal past performance.
SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the applicant's proposal past performance.
MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the applicant's proposal past performance.

<DESC>09 April 2007 (1) Is there an incumbent for this?    Answer-No a.  If so, who is it and what/when was award amount?  N/A (2) Our instructors are seasoned instructors with over two decades of DOD instructional background, most are PhDs and authors of several books, TV programs, have experience in theater as well as testifying in front of Congress on Afghanistan, Iraq, Arab Is raeli Issues, etc.  Our audiences include the gamut of agencies and operational units as well as most SF organizations.  Are you saying our trainers and instructors need to be certified by the government as outlined in 5.2.3 and 5.3.1 in grammar, attention , eye contact, gestures, etc?    Answer-Yes a.  Additionally, we utilize many well known individuals as well for our training when their availability allows such as XXXXX, XXXXX, XXXXX, XXXXX, as well as many others with this level of experience.  Are you saying these people would also require certi fication?    Answer-Yes  (3) Specifically, what security clearances are needed for this contract?  At p.14, #25 you state the contractor will maintain clearance prior to task orders yet you dont specify what level of classification we need.  This implies that the contracting offi cer issuing task order directs what level clearance will be needed for the training.  Yet, there are no specifications included.  The task order could specify TS/SBI or SCI, simple Secret to even Mystic.  Specifically, what clearances  if any  are needed  on the part of the instructors?     Answer-a NACLC or better (4) Finally, at p. 14, #27 you ask for a completed, favorably adjudicated NACLC check for every instructor.  Yet, in the next paragraph you say NACLC processing takes 6 months.  Is this accurate?   Answer-This was accurate at the writing of the clause perf ormed by the security subject matter expert (SME). The SME included in discussion that the regulations cited provided for an interim NACLC in a shorter time frame.  a.  If the government wants a small business to take this contract and there is very little lead time, how can this requirement be amended  if at allto allow a small business to compete?
