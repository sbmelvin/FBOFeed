<DESC>This notice serves as a combined pre-solicitation synopsis for the repair of various spare repairables on various aircraft. The NAVSUP Weapon System Support plans renew Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N0038314G002D for the repair/modification of 79 items that are used on various aircrafts. The line items that will be repaired under this contract have been uploaded with this synopsis as Attachment A. GE Aviation System Support LLC, located in Grand Rapids, MI is the only known source to possess repair capabilities. Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government. Even though these items are sole source to GE Aviation Systems LLC, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
For any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, Ariell Wilkins at 215-697-3848 or ariell.wilkins@navy.mil. 
The subject items requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not  been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for repair.
This brochure identifies technical data to be submitted based on your companys experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at:
https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navsupwss/business_opps or by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215)697-4243. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS - P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.
