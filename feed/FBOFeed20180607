<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a presolicitation notice for a requirement entitled, "Risk-Informed Reviews of Instrumentation and Control Systems/Components."
<p>The objective of this requirement is to provide support in developing the technical basis for further risk-informing the regulatory framework for instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) systems or components.</p>
<p>This requirement includes four tasks to be completed in two stages. The first stage includes three tasks. The first task is to assess the technical feasibility of risk-informed approaches and further integrating risk insights into the regulatory review framework for I&amp;C systems or components. This assessment will be based upon state-of-the-art or state-or-the-practice approaches used in other agencies or industries and will include: (1) a summary of current practices, lessons learned, and challenges for applying probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) and risk insights to digital I&amp;C at operating and new reactors; (2) identification of potential gaps; and (3) as applicable, requirements for methods, models, data, or analytical tools needed to be developed further for establishing a risk-informed regulatory framework for digital I&amp;C systems. The second task is to establish a risk-informed categorization process that can be used to: (1) classify major I&amp;C systems or components with respect to risk insights and safety significance; and (2) focus licensee and NRC resources on those I&amp;C systems or components identified as being important to safety. The third task is to establish potential methods and analytical tools for: (1) estimating failure frequencies of digital I&amp;C systems; and (2) assessing and addressing uncertainties in these estimates. The fourth task to be performed in the second stage is to develop recommendations for further integrating risk insights into the digital I&amp;C regulatory infrastructure, including license review approaches and inspection focus, in a manner that complements the NRC's deterministic approach and supports the NRC's traditional defense-in-depth philosophy.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>The applying organization must have key staff who possess at least an undergraduate degree in nuclear engineering, electrical engineering, or reliability/risk engineering with in-depth expertise and a preferred minimum of 10 years of experience in the following areas:<br />&bull; BWR, PWR, or advanced non-LWR (including high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, sodium-cooled reactor, molten salt reactor, and liquid metal cooled reactor) nuclear power plant designs.<br />&bull; I&amp;C systems or components used in the aforementioned reactor designs, including experience with analyzing failure modes and effects of failures on I&amp;C safety functions.<br />&bull; NRC's I&amp;C regulatory infrastructure.<br />&bull; Risk-informed categorization and treatment of SSCs for nuclear reactors and related risk-informed RGs.<br />&bull; PRA methods and related state-of-the-art research on estimation of software and digital I&amp;C system failure frequency and reliability.<br />&bull; Previously completed PRAs or reports that estimated risk associated with systems for safety critical applications.<br />&bull; General project management.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be four years from date of award.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541330- Engineering Services, SIC Code 8711.T The small business size standard is annual receipts for the preceding three fiscal years not-to-exceed $15M.</p>
