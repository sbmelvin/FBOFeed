<DESC>This is a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA).&nbsp; The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB intends to award a sole source, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to&nbsp;L-3 Communications Cincinnati Electronics.&nbsp;This acquisition is unrestricted.<br /><br />
<p>The AFFTC Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) program plans to modernize range Flight Termination Systems (FTSs) by integrating the EFTS Capability. This approach will replace the current analog FTS with an enhanced digital FTS. The EFTS allows configurable mission support while providing a secure and reliable communications link. The EFTS uses a digital frequency modulated (FM) based technique known as continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) along with signal encryption and authentication to provide a secure and reliable pathway for the purpose of vehicle control (e.g. flight termination) in order to protect the public from malfunctioning vehicles. The EFTS components will be integrated into the command transmitter system. The TDU will provide all encryption capability, the encoder unit will be used in Range Safety systems to receive, format and process externally generated command messages and the monitor will be used to provide Range Safety with an analysis tool. The program seeks to provide the existing EFTS products to the Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) community at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) Edwards AFB, CA. <br /><br />Requirement:<br /><br />The maximum value of this ID/IQ contract is $5M. The period of performance is expected to be five years after contract award. The following is a description of each item/service. These Flight Termination System components are currently used by U.S. Test Ranges, including, but not limited to White Sands Missile Range, Naval Air Warfare Center, Pt. Mugu, Naval Air Warfare Center, China Lake, Edwards Air Force Base, and NASA Dryden. This contract will ensure maintainability of equipment for all U.S. armed services and other government agencies. Supplies included under this contract are:<br /><br />A.) EFTS 600 - The encoder unit is a rack mounted device that will be integrated with the ground-to-air data link transmitting stations and operate in conjunction with the EFTS flight termination receiver. The unit will receive and format externally generated command messages from Command Controllers (devices that generate the 64-bit EFTS message). The encoder will integrate and interface with the EFTS-602 to encrypt command messages. The unit must meet RCC 208-06 requirements. The following interfaces shall be provided using RS-232 and separate connectors for each: EFTS Command Controller, Central Encoder Interface, Remote Encoder Interfaces 1-4 and a control and status interface. The system shall have discrete external monitoring. The design of the unit has already been evaluated by NSA for use with the EFTS for SECURE applications.<br />B.) EFTS-601 - The EFTS monitor will be used to provide Range Safety with an analysis tool. The monitor provides an independent verification of the transmitted CPFSK EFTS signal. This unit will have the ability to function as a stand-alone, independent system, capable of performing open loop, end-to-end verification of the CTS. The monitor will be a passive radio frequency (RF) device and will integrate and interface with the EFTS-602 to decrypt and output command messages and other data. The following interfaces shall be provided using RS-232 and RS-422 and separate connectors for each. Post Detection output, Post Correction Output, Post Decryption output. The design of the unit has already been evaluated by NSA for use with the EFTS for SECURE applications.<br />C.) EFTS-602 - The Triple Data Encryption Standard Unit (TDU) is an encryption/decryption component that is used in the Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) transmitter ground equipment. The unit is a NSA approved for use Type 2 product that will integrate with the EFTS-600 and EFTS-601 components. The unit is a standalone encryption/decryption module that was designed for use in future ground equipment without necessitating further NSA review. The TDU must be characterized for TEMPEST requirements. It must accept Crypto Key Fill from COMSEC fill devices such as the DTD, DTD 2000, or the SKL and provide the ability to store 50 keys. <br />D.) Diagnosis and Repair - The repairable item will be sent to the contractor for diagnostics and teardown. Contractor shall provide a diagnostics report to the Government including labor, materials, and parts if the component is repairable. Contractor shall track TDU, encoder, and monitor failures and make the data available to the Government for the life of the contract. <br /><br />Contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Government's requirement.&nbsp; Anticipated Award date is end of July 2010. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

References:a.	VADS draft SIR, No. DTFAWA-10-R-00018, posted 4/22/10b.	TSS Market Survey No. 9497, posted 5/10/10.
The purpose of this notice is to advise all interested parties that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has decided to restructure the referenced support services acquisitions and combine them into a single acquisition that will support the entire ATC Communications Services organization.  The new acquisition will be called Enterprise Communications Support Services (ECSS).  It is also anticipated that part of this requirement will be set aside for small business.
This change in acquisition strategy was the result of feedback received from industry as well as continuing analysis of the overall scope and approach for obtaining these critical support services.
It is the FAA's intent to release another draft SIR for industry review and comment as soon as is practicable.

<DESC>This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.
Purpose of Announcement: In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS), Paragraph 3.2.2.4, this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected vendor using single source procedures.
The FAA intends to negotiate and award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Overhaul / Repair of Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) Klystron Tubes to Communications & Power Industries, Inc. (DBA CPI) under Screening Information Request (SIR) DTFAAC-10-R-55239 to provide all necessary labor, facilities, equipment, materials, travel, and subcontractors (as applicable) to overhaul and repair TDWR Klystron Tubes for use by the FAA (NSN 5960-01-360-3639).  The contractor shall be required to repair tubes to a serviceable condition meeting all specifications in controlled drawings for this item.  Work consists of minor repairs, major repairs, rebuild of tube, and determinations of serviceability or irreparable (Beyond Economically Repairable-BER) conditions.  The contract will include a 365 calendar day base contract period and up to four (4) option periods of the same length.  
The FAA has made a single source determination insofar that CPI owns the proprietary data rights to this item to include all manufacturing and repair data.  It would not be cost-effective or practical for any other sources to acquire and/or develop manufacturing and repair capabilities for this item given the FAA's delivery requirements, manufacturing lead time, and procurement lead time.  A fair and reasonable price will be negotiated by FAA with CPI for all deliverables under this acquisition.
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed to Shauna Martinez, Contract Specialist, by 4:00 PM CT, 16 June 2010, via email at shauna.martinez@faa.gov
The FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred and associated with any response to this announcement.

1.)	The cutting to specifications of 87 acres of vegetation, including trees and shrubs, in preparation for treatment by Removal by Cable Yarding (Highlead or Skyline) or Hand Treatment Methods. From Units 150 and 246 (a total of 27 acres), the Forest Service has a need for its sole use, the cut trees and chipped materials. Logs, and cut firewood, removed from these Units will be transported to a Designated Process and Storage Area in Kyle Canyon. Chipped materials from Unit 150 will be stockpiled at the Process and Storage Area near Unit 150. All cut and chipped materials from Unit 246, not chipped on site will be transported to the Process and Storage Area in Kyle Canyon. Cut materials from other units may be used by the Forest Service for its sole use when left by the Contractor at Final Acceptance of the Project. In the remaining 60 acres, some units or portions of Units may be suitable for treatment with small Cable Yarding systems. If the Contractors proposal includes a yarding system to be used when treating these acres, including ground-based or cable yarding, these systems may be used, otherwise units will be treated solely by Hand Removal or chip-on-site Techniques.
2.)	Trees and cut material over 1-inch in diameter and 3 feet in length, will be treated by Chip-in-Place methods, or removed from the unit and be further treated by chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Materials removed from the units may also be cut to firewood lengths or logs to 25 feet in length or less, and transported to the Process and Storage Area, and neatly stockpiled. Materials stockpiled in the Process and Storage Areas are the property of the Contractor until the Project is Final Accepted, upon which time ownership transfers to the Forest Service, which may issue permits allowing the Public to remove the materials at a later date or use it for its sole needs. Except in Units 150 and 246, the contractor may allow the public to remove materials from the units or Process and Storage Areas prior to Final Acceptance if removal can be done safely. The Forest Service will write a Work Order stating the conditions of removal and the contractor can have the public attach the Work Order to the load prior to the materials leaving the Unit or the Process and Storage Areas.
3.)	The cutting, pruning, or limbing, of trees to specification and chipping into bins, transported to a Process and Storage Area, unless Chipped-in-Place. 
4.)	The cutting to specification of Shrubs and their treatment by chipping-in-Place or Chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area. Shrubs not listed in preferred species specifications will require cutting to specification also.
5.)	Specific Unit prescriptions follow in this project description.
6.)

If contractor proposes to take the chipper into the unit or off an existing road or skidtrail, the machinery must be of the Low Ground or Low Tire Pressure type. The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage, Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
7.)	There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit Prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated.

<DESC>This project involves the following work.

1.)	The cutting to specifications of 96.1 acres of vegetation, including trees and shrubs, in preparation for treatment by Hand Treatment Methods. In Unit 302, trees and cut materials over 1-inch in diameter and 3-feet in length will be treated by hand piling to specification. In all other Units, trees and cut material over 1-inch in diameter and 3 feet in length, will be treated by Chip-in-Place methods, or removed from the unit and be further treated by chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Materials removed from the units may also be cut to firewood lengths or logs to 25 feet in length or less, and transported to the Process and Storage Area, and neatly stockpiled. Materials stockpiled in the Process and Storage Areas are the property of the Contractor until the Project is Final Accepted, at which time ownership transfers to the Forest Service, which may issue permits allowing the Public to remove the materials at a later date. The contractor may allow the public to remove materials from the units prior to Final Acceptance if removal can be done safely. The Forest Service will write a Work Order stating the conditions of removal and the contractor can have the public attach the Work Order to the load prior to the materials leaving the Unit.
2.)	The cutting, pruning, or limbing, of trees to specification and chipping into bins, or transported to a Process and Storage Area, unless Chipped-in-Place, or cut and piled. 
3.)	The cutting to specification of Shrubs and their treatment by chipping-in-Place or Chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area, or cut and piled. Shrubs not listed in preferred species specifications will require cutting to specification also.
4.)	Specific Unit prescriptions follow in this project description.
5.)	In Units selected by the Contractor to be treated as Chip-in-Place, all cut materials and materials scheduled for treatment, will be chipped-in-place using a chipper deemed most appropriate by the contractor and described in the Request for Proposal (RFP). If contractor proposes to take the chipper into the unit or off an existing road or skidtrail, the machinery must be of the Low Ground or Low Tire Pressure type. The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
6.)	There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated. Hand treatment is hand cut, hand carry all cut materials outside the flagged polygon and treated as described in the Schedule of Items. Contractor will not pile any materials inside of these polygons, but chipped materials may be chipped into the polygons if agreed to by the Contracting Officer.
7.)	Polygons are shown on the unit maps provided in the contract or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions, but others may only be flagged on the ground. There is no separate pay item in the Schedule of Items for these areas.
8.)	Trees and Shrubs are defined in the Contract Specifications.
9.)	Wood and Chips which have been stacked or piled in the Processing and Storage Areas, is the property of the Contractor until Final Acceptance of the Project by the Forest Service. After Final Acceptance any remaining wood and chips may be distributed by the Forest Service under the permitting process.
10.) Quaking Aspen may be found in any unit and when found will require cutting 	to specification, unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer. 	Units which require cutting to specification if Quaking Aspen is present 	are identified in the Specific Unit Prescriptions.
	11.) Units may contain one or more dry washes. In dry washes, avoid 	treating Riparian vegetation in and on the banks. No piling of cut 	vegetation is permitted in or on the banks of dry washes. The Contracting 	Officer will walk units with the contractor prior to work beginning in units 	containing dry washes.
12.) Riparian Vegetation does not include Conifer Species.
13.) Residential Housing or other structures are present in many of the units in this project and:  H 4, Table 1. Specified defensible zone space distances are applicable to these areas.
14) Units will not be released for treatment all at one time, but instead will be released as previously worked in units have been completed. Contractor should indicate on the submitted work schedule the sequence of unit release and completion dates at the time of submission of the RFP. 
15.) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer prior to award of this contract, contracts awarded on the Spring Mountain Natural Recreation Area will be considered concurrent with previously awarded contacts. Awarded contracts will not be worked on consecutively. The Notice to Proceed will be issued shortly after award of contract and completion date will not be extended. 

16.) The Forest Service may negotiate with the Contractor, during the contract period to Remove Chipped materials or Logs, cut to a variety of lengths, to a Process and Storage Area designated by the Forest Service. The Forest Service may pay a minimal fee to the Contractor for this Removed, Transported, and Stockpiled materials. 

17.) At the Prework meeting, the contractor will submit a work schedule indicating how they will complete the contract within the contract time. Each week the work schedule will be reviewed. If the work schedule does not indicate that the contract will be completed within the contract time, the contractor will be expected to adjust the workforce and methods of work, to complete the contracted work within the contract time.

The project area is located on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest; Clark County, Nevada.  The Project is approximately 21 Air Miles Northeast from Las Vegas on Highway 156. The Project starts at approximately the intersection of Highways 156 and 158 then Southwest for approximately 3.5 miles on Highway 156. The project can be reached by motor vehicle by leaving Las Vegas on Highway 95 North to the intersection with Highway 156 East. Highway 156 leads to Highway 158. The work requires the pruning to specification of trees, the cutting of trees not scheduled for pruning, and the cutting to specification of shrubs scheduled for removal. Trees, limbs and shrubs will be chipped-on-site or removed to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Chipped materials, wood cut to firewood lengths and trees cut to 25-foot or less lengths remain the property of the contractor until Final Acceptance of Unit or Project. At Final Acceptance of Unit or Project, ownership of cut materials is transferred to the Forest Service which may issue permits to the public for removal.  Approximately 100.0 acres are scheduled to be Chipped-in-Place. In addition, under a separate Pay Item, approximately 8 trees near structures are scheduled for removal by Directionally Felled Techniques, and removal to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Ownership of these trees is retained by the Forest Service and will be disposed of by the Forest Service. The material to be pruned, cut and piled or chipped-in-place is shrubs and small trees.  Most trees are less than 14” diameter measured at 4.5 feet above the ground (DBH). The contract period will be contiguous, and will occur between May 15 and June 1.  This pre-solicitation notice is for a unit-based performance service contract on approximately 100.0 acres, approximately 8 Directionally Felled Trees, plus mobilization. In Units designated as Hand Treatment Methods, the Forest Service has determined that cut materials are able to be transported to a chipper by hand methods. In Units designated as Hand Treatment Methods or Yarding Methods, the Forest Service has determined that some materials may require a yarder to transport to a chipper. In these acres additional labor will eliminate the need for a yarder. Contractor may allow the Public to remove cut materials or chips from the units or from the Process and Storage Areas until Final Acceptance of the Unit or Project. At final acceptance of unit or project all cut and chipped materials becomes the property of the Forest Service. The contract requires the Contractor to furnish all labor, equipment, transportation, supplies, supervision, and incidentals necessary to achieve the objectives.  All work shall be performed during daylight hours, and shall not exceed 10 hours in one day.

ITEM 125

Acres in Units Treated by Cut and Pile Methods Only.
It is the intention of the Forest Service to chip-in-place, or remove to a Designated Storage Area any cut materials created by contractor operations. Units described in the Schedule of Items as: Acre Cut to Specification for Fuels Removal. Cut Materials Removed by Accepted Proposal Method. Cut Materials Processed by Chipping on Site or Removed, may contain acreage which cannot be treated successfully by the Contractors Proposed Method. The Forest Service recognizes that the Contractor may encounter acreage which can only be treated by the Cutting and Piling Treatment Method, in preparation for burning by the Forest 

Service at a later date. The Forest Service expects a minimum of 75% of the acreage in each unit, to be treated by the Proposed Method of the contractor. The contractor should therefore propose a price per acre to Cut and Pile the cut material and expect this bid price to be applied to any and all acreage that can only be Cut and Piled to specification. Contractor understands that the acreage that can be cut and piled cannot exceed 25% of the unit acreage.  
The intent of this contract is to provide for the complete removal of all Fire Fuels from the Units, and transported to designated Process and Storage areas. The intent of this contract is to prepare any remaining acres which have piles to be burned by Forest Service Fire Personnel the following Fall and Winter. Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, transportation, and supplies and perform all work required to complete the project in accordance with drawings, specifications, and provisions of the contract.

Payment for work will ONLY be made for and under those pay items included in the Schedule of Items. ALL other work and materials will be considered as incidental to and included in the payment for items shown.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for an Intensified CCD camera and an ImagingSpectrometer System for use in characterizing fuel spray, combustion and emissions fromaircraft combustor simulators. These devices will be used for laser induced fluorescenceand Raman scattering spectroscopy measurements, among others. Measured signals will beprimarily from the ultraviolet through the visible.NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Princeton Instruments.The components of this purchase must be fully compatible and interchangeable withexisting hardware (Princeton Instruments PI-MAX and Acton SP-300 monochromator/imagingspectrometer). In addition, they must also be capable of being seamlessly controlledusing the Princeton Instruments WinView and WinSpec software, which is used to operatethe cameras and spectrometer. Princeton Instruments is the sole supplier of thisproprietary software.Both the existing and new instrumentation will be used in at least three different testcells and will be configured as needed for the particular tests to be conducted. Theseexperiments include Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence, Spontaneous Raman Scattering,flame emission spectroscopy, and Particle Image Velocimetry, among others. Thus, therequirement for both old and new components to be physically compatible is imperative, soas to move seamlessly from one test cell to another. Substitution by any other productwill reduce the efficiency of setup, data taking, and the productivity of processingthese data.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon June 14, 2010.

<DESC>Recovery  This notice is provided for information purposes only.  NASA LaRCintends to issue a fixed-price contract to Mosaic ATM Inc entitled Systems Analysis ofDynamic Big Airspace Design Concept for Metroplex Operations. This competitive actionwill be funded by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA). The award resultsfrom a competitive selection under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA) Headquarters released NASA Research Announcement (NRA) for foundational researchin support of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD), entitled "ResearchOpportunities in Aeronautics (ROA) 2009 under NNH09ZEA001N, Amendment 1, NextGen Airportal Project.  The NextGen-Airportal Project works in close collaboration with theNextGen-Airspace Project to conduct airspace and Airportal foundational research anddiscipline-based technology.  The project focuses on NASAs technical expertise andworld-class facilities to enable the highest possible efficiency in the use of gates,taxiways, runways, metroplex (a group of two or more adjacent airports whose arrival anddeparture operations are highly interdependent) airspace and other Airportal resources. The project is researching, developing, demonstrating, and validating operationalconcepts, proof-of-concept systems, algorithms, technologies, tools, and operationalprocedures designed to maximize capacity and throughput in the Airportal environmentwhile enabling associated elements of the Next Generation Air Transportation System(NextGen) as defined by the Joint Planning and Development Office.  NextGen-AirportalProject research focus areas are the following: Safe and Efficient Surface Operations(SESO), Coordinated Arrival and Departure Operations Management (CADOM), and Airportaland Metroplex Integration (AMI). SESO conducts research to manage traffic on the airportsurface (gates, taxiways, and runways) safely and efficiently to enable maximumthroughput and capacity in the airport environment. CADOM focuses on concepts andtechnologies needed to mitigate operational constraints to maximizing single and multipleairport capacity. AMI focuses on management of metroplex operations, integration of workacross the Projects technical areas, and crosscutting research (e.g., human/systemintegration and concept analyses for portfolio management). The objective is to developDynamic Big Airspace Design (DBAD) methodologies for dynamically generating efficientmetroplex airspace configurations. (Big Airspace is an FAA concept that includesexpanding the size of the terminal area around busy airports and metroplexes to increasecapacity and efficiency.) The concept combines DBAD with optimal planning of aircraftassignments to routes through the metroplex and scheduling along those routes.

TheNextGen-Airportal Project works in close collaboration with the NextGen-Airspace Projectto conduct airspace and Airportal foundational research and discipline-based technology. The NextGen-Airportal project focuses on NASAs technical expertise and world-classfacilities to enable the highest possible efficiency in the use of gates, taxiways,runways, metroplex (a group of two or more adjacent airports whose arrival and departureoperations are highly interdependent) airspace and other Airportal resources.  TheNextGen-Airportal project is researching, developing, demonstrating, and validatingoperational concepts, proof-of-concept systems, algorithms, technologies, tools, andoperational procedures designed to maximize capacity and throughput in the Airportalenvironment while enabling associated elements of the Next Generation Air TransportationSystem (NextGen) as defined by the Joint Planning and Development Office. NextGen-Airportal Project research focus areas are the following: Safe and EfficientSurface Operations (SESO), Coordinated Arrival and Departure Operations Management(CADOM), and Airportal and Metroplex Integration (AMI). SESO conducts research to managetraffic on the airport surface (gates, taxiways, and runways) safely and efficiently toenable maximum throughput and capacity in the airport environment. CADOM focuses onconcepts and technologies needed to mitigate operational constraints to maximizing singleand multiple airport capacity.	AMI focuses on management of metroplex operations,integration of work across the Projects technical areas, and crosscutting research(e.g., human/system integration and concept analyses for portfolio management).  Underthis contract, the Contractor will develop a concept that enhances integrated metroplexarrival and departure coordination to determine the temporal (the use of time foraircraft separation) and spatial (the physical separation of aircraft) impact ofmetroplex traffic coordination within the National Airspace System (NAS) and to quantifythe benefits of the most desirable metroplex traffic coordination concept.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Program Motor Transport, Quantico, Virginia intends to solicit and award a contract to SUMMA Technology, Inc. (hereafter referred to as "SUMMA"),  of Huntsville, AL on a Sole Source basis for two hundred and eighty (280) MK1077 Palletized Loading System (PLS) Flatracks, NSN 3990-01-537-1045.   The statutory authority permitting this award is FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  The Marine Corps has a requirement for tandem tow capability, meaning that the MK1077s and PLS Trailers need to be delivered concurrently in theater to facilitate loading, unloading, and transporting cargo.  
There are currently ninety-five (95) Logistical Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) and thirty (30) PLS Trailers in theater without the required MK1077 Flatracks.  An additional forty (40) PLS Trailers will be delivered in September and October 2010 that will also be in need of the MK1077 Flatracks.  Because SUMMA is the original manufacturer of the MK1077s, they are the only source that can deliver them in accordance with the PLS trailer delivery schedule. SUMMA also is the only company to currently hold the necessary requisite safety and transportability certifications from the USMC and US Army, thus enabling fielding to begin immediately upon delivery. This contract will be awarded under FAR Part 12, with a period of performance of 12 months from date of award.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals, and no solicitation is available. This award fulfills the immediate need in theater and will be followed by a competitive RFP for approximately two thousand and eight hundred (2800) MK1077s.  
A determination not to compete this requirement on a full and open basis is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government point of contact for this notice is Ms. Rene Staton, who can be reached via e-mail at renee.staton@usmc.mil.  No telephonic inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC><br /><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY -</strong> Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.<br />The Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of the Protected Resources Division of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for a priority research project relative to the development of desktop survival estimates for Atlantic salmon smolts and kelts in the Penobscot River, Maine at 15 dams.<br />NMFS seeks to contract the development of desktop survival estimates for Atlantic salmon smolts and kelts in the Penobscot River, Maine at 15 dams (Table 1). The objective of this contract is the development of numerical survival distribution for Atlantic salmon smolts and kelts in the Penobscot River. The reports produced under this contract will use available, site-specific turbine system data, fish characteristics, and hydrological records to construct expected numerical distributions of Atlantic salmon survival at existing hydroelectric dams on the Penobscot River. These desktop survival analyses will include both direct mortality attributable to dam passage as well as delayed mortality based on available literature.<br />Site-specific survival studies are available for some hydroelectric facilities in the Penobscot Basin. These studies have been summarized by Fay et al. (2006) and Holbrook (2007). However, the limitations of currently available data are significant and NMFS is seeking to inform its modeling efforts with the best available data through the implementation of this contract. The implementation of this contract will include a comparison of any site-specific survival studies to the expected survival distributions. In instances where the expected distribution is different than the site-specific data, the vendor will be required to provide a justification for the differences (flow, water temperature, fish behavior, dam operations, etc).<br />This project only includes the compilation of existing data and information needed to develop numerical distributions of salmon smolt and kelt survival at existing hydroelectric facilities (Table 1) based upon: (1) Site-specific operations (number and type of turbines, head, wicket gate settings, etc.); (2) Station capacity and flow duration data; (3) Existing downstream fishway type and existing effectiveness data for those fishways; (4) Atlantic salmon life history factors (size, migration timing, etc.) The project does not require the collection of novel data. The majority of the contractor's time is expected to be spent reviewing existing literature and developing defensible survival distributions based on the available literature, synthesis of available data, and available characteristics of the environment (hydrography, temperature regimes, etc.), the fish (size, life history, etc.), and the physical characteristics of the various hydroelectric facilities (dam height, turbine types, wicket gate settings, downstream passage facilities, etc). Collection and synthesis of this information will require close coordination with numerous hydroelectric dam owners and natural resource agencies.<br />Table 1.

<DESC>&nbsp; This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is issued by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)-Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), on behalf of the Defense Travel Management Office.
<p>DISA-DITCO is conducting market research in accordance with FAR Subpart 10, to determine whether two or more SBA-certified 8(a) sources possess the requisite capabilities to successfully perform the requirements stated herein. The NAICS Code identified for these requirements is 518210-Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services, with a size standard of $25.0 million.</p>
<p>This Request For Information/Sources Sought Notice IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals and no award will be made as a result of this notice.<br />The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for information received in response to this notice. Sources choosing to respond to this notice are wholly responsible for any costs/expenses associated with submitting a response. Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of this sources sought notice. <br />The information obtained from submitted responses may be used in development of an acquisition strategy and future solicitation.</p>
<p>DISA-DITCO is considering a firm-fixed price acquisition, competed as an 8(a) set-aside, provided that the written capabilities submitted by SBA-certified 8(a) vendors demonstrate the ability to successfully perform the required services, as determined by the Department of Defense. If initial capability is determined by written submissions, those 8(a) vendors will be required to perform a technical demonstration of their ability to perform the requirements stated herein.</p>
<p>If the Government determines that a set-aside procurement is appropriate, any resultant solicitation will be posted on https://www.fbo.gov/. It is the responsibility of respondents to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any future related synopsis or solicitation.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO), established in February 2006, consolidates, streamlines and centrally manages commercial travel, providing a single focal point to the Department of Defense (DoD) and industry. DTMO initiatives focus on transforming the Defense Travel Enterprise by implementing innovative solutions and providing the best value for the travel community. DTMO partners across the Federal Government and private sector to maintain an in-depth perspective of the travel industry and determine the best practices and standards for DoD travel. <br />DTMO has a data repository that consolidates travel data from various sources. The data repository enables use of travel data to discover and understand data patterns, as well as develop metrics to foster issue resolution and decision making. In direct support of DoD's single source of travel data initiative, contractor support is required to provide database and infrastructure support for the travel data repository.</p>
<p>Requirements:<br />The work to support the travel data repository is considered mission critical to DTMO, so contractor support requires demonstrated capability and expertise in the areas of: information technology; data quality; both DoD and industry travel processes, operations and strategies; Global Distribution Systems strategies and processes; commercial travel office operations and implementations; government travel suppliers; and government travel policy (e.g., Joint Federal Travel Regulations, Volume I; Joint Travel Regulations, Volume II). Successful performance depends on data quality - timely, accurate and reliable information relating to the data, in a manner that is accessible by the Government. Accessible data is that which DTMO can readily locate and rely upon. In addition to ensuring data integrity, data must be structured correctly so it is useful to DTMO. Any delay or failure in providing timely, accurate and reliable information relating to the data will jeopardize the Government's ability to perform any number of critical functions, including, but not limited to, enforcing policy compliance, meeting reporting deadlines and issuing travel information to the DoD community.</p>
<p>1) Operating and maintaining the current data infrastructure, as well as developing and implementing enhancements, including, but not limited to: architecture definition; database design; data analysis; data definition; existing application and tool migration; new application and tool development; data processing; quality assurance; and travel data subject matter expertise.</p>
<p>2) Maintain and develop interfaces between the data repository and other travel applications. Develop and maintain documentation, including, but not limited to: reports; user guides; database documentation; infrastructure documentation; and interface documentation.</p>
<p>3) Maximize technology offerings, to include leveraging the latest information technology solutions and innovations, in order for DTMO to integrate and use the travel data most effectively.</p>
<p>4) Demonstrated capability and expertise in the areas of: information technology; data quality; both DoD and industry travel processes, operations and strategies; Global Distribution Systems strategies and processes; commercial travel office operations and implementations; government travel suppliers; and government travel policy.</p>
<p>5) Acquire travel data from various sources and consolidate in the repository. Accomplish acquisition and consolidation by performing data definition, data collection, data validation, data normalization, data analysis, data integration, data processing and data scripting activities. Support the operations and maintenance of the travel data infrastructure.</p>
<p>6) Collect the travel data from various industry sources as identified by the Government, such as, but not limited to, Global Distribution Systems, commercial travel offices, airlines, hotels, car rental companies, rail vendors, the travel card vendor and third party data aggregators. Gather travel related data from other DoD and federal government sources including, but not limited to, the General Services Administration, Department of State and Defense Manpower Data Center. For per diem data, maintain and update the per diem expanded list of locations with the Geographic Names Information System county listing.</p>
<p>7) Gather additional reference data in order to validate, normalize and authenticate the travel data received from the various government and industry sources.</p>
<p>8) Maintain and modify any database schemas, tables, table columns, keys and indices needed to store the travel data. Store data using industry best practices, including, but not limited to: validating the data; eliminating redundancies; normalizing; using referential integrity to increase the performance of the databases; and minimizing the physical space required to store all travel data. Adhere to DoD and DTMO guidelines and policies related to data processing, Privacy Act and Information Assurance.</p>
<p>9) Upload all data to the travel data repository by either web services or Extract/Transform/Load (ETL) scripts, consistent with developed Data Quality Assurance Program. The frequency of data upload will range from every 15 minutes to quarterly, based on the type of data.</p>
<p>10) Conduct ongoing analyses of the data repository and existing data sources in order to support the enhancement of a master data model. An enhanced master data model will promote a high level of confidence in data sources and help identify effective approaches to make the gathered data accessible. DTMO must be able to readily locate and rely upon the data. To ensure data integrity, data must be structured correctly so it is useful to DTMO.</p>
<p>11) Routine data management tasks include, but are not limited to: maintaining and modifying, as necessary, the ETL scripts to import data into the travel data repository; executing existing reports and developing new reports, as requested; maintaining existing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and creating new APIs, as requested; and maintaining data integrity (i.e., reliability and accuracy) in the development, test and production environments.</p>
<p>12) Maintain an existing data management portal that was developed using JBOSS and Java. The web-based portal uses portlets to display information about the travel data repository. The portal includes details on the health of the data repository, status of loading data, results of the data load and limited query capability, just to name a few. Maintain the existing portal, develop new portlets and update the portal, as requested by the Government.</p>
<p>13) Support the operation and maintenance of the travel data infrastructure. Data infrastructure tasks require knowledge of Oracle and Microsoft Structured Query Language, as well as Microsoft Windows, UNIX and Linux system administration.</p>
<p>14) Ability to develop and implement an overall Data Quality Assurance Program to ensure quality standards will be met during performance.</p>
<p>15) Maintain, review and develop technical documents in support of the requirements described herein. Develop and/or maintain documents such as, but not limited to: data management plans; interface specifications; software documentation; security plans; API documentation; ETL script documentation; integration agreements; and capability plans.</p>

<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for Photogammetry Hardware and Software Upgrades for existing PhotoScan (SFT00200) and AutoScan (SFT00202) equipment.
This product is known to be available only from Intergraph as they are the creator of the existing product.  The USGS/EROS manages and archives over 10 million frames of aerial and satellite imagery and the only means by which the science community can get access to these data are through the use of high resolution photogrammetric quality scanners that can cost close to $200,000 each when purchased new.  The USGS/EROS needs to update two existing high-resolution INTERGRAPH PhotoScan 2002 film scanning workstations to meet the scanning requirements of the science community.  One scanning workstation only needs to have its software upgraded because its integrated process controller was replaced last year when it failed to function properly.  The other scanning workstation needs to have both its software upgraded and integrated process controller replaced with one that closely matches the one purchased last year since its existing processing system was recently found incapable of processing large format color imagery being requested by the science community.  The new upgraded version of the INTERGRAPH proprietary software running on both scanning systems will provide additional capability to automatically stitch together scans of imagery that are larger than 9-inch by 9-inch size, improve performance, and address existing bugs in the software.  This software is proprietary to INTERGRAPH, is required by the PhotoScan 2002 scanner, and is only available from INTERGRAPH.  On-site installation is required in order to finalize configuration of the workstations and software by a trained professional.  Obtaining these controllers and software upgrades is far more cost advantageous to the Government that replacing the system in its entirety.
The proposed action may be awarded without full and open competition under U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), unique source.
The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to INTERGRAPH, unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes he can provide a software upgrade to existing Intergraph hardware and who are also certified and trained by Intergraph.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contracting Officer, vfloyd@usgs.gov, no later than 06/112010, 1pm EST with an affirmative answer.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to the Palantir Technologies, 100 Hamilton Street, Palo Alto, Ca 94301. A contract shall be issued for a six month trail of a IT platform. We are seeking a six month trial of an IT platform through Palantir Technologies, Inc. for rapid visualization, analysis, and collaboration on data related to multistate foodborne disease outbreak investigations. This trial would be for up to 30 users including users from CDC and the Outbreak Sentinel Sites (OSS) in Utah, Wisconsin, and New York City. The goal of this pilot will be assess the utility of this platform. Palantir Technologies is the only organization able to provide this service without program redundancy and an unneccessary reinvention of the current platform. Failure to procure this IT platform will invariably cause a duplicative expenditure of considerable funds, and likely an inferior result obtained by the CDC. The solicitation with statement of work will not be available. Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Gary Morgan by email at glm1@CDC.gov. Calls will not be entertained.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator has stated his commitment to prepare for the whole community and has directed a phase out of all the cots in our current inventory.&nbsp; FEMA is looking&nbsp;to the industry for a cot that will accommodate an even greater portion of society. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Robert T. Stafford Act Sec. 308.(a) Nondiscrimination in Disaster Assistance requires that supplies and other relief and assistance activities shall be accomplished in an equitable and impartial manner, without discrimination on grounds of disability, age. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>General population shelters provide shelter to our citizens and will start meeting the needs of a more inclusive community. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Fair Housing Act and others require that equal services and programs be provided to people with disabilities in the same manner as provided to people without disabilities. Cots must be wider, heavier and more comfortable, and those in wheelchairs can more easily, and safely, transfer on and off of them.

<SUBJECT>Special notice of intent to award a contract on a sole source basis for the management of the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Retained Segment of the University of California Retirement Plan
<SOLNBR>DENA0000538
<RESPDATE>062210
<CONTACT>Leticia Potts, Contract Specialist, Phone 505-845-4371, Email lpotts@doeal.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Business Services intends to negotiate a sole source contract with the Regents of the University of California (UC), Oakland CA, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. The Office of Business Services anticipates that this effort will be available only from the UC and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. It is anticipated that the contract will be awarded to UC because it is the sole responsible source available to manage and administer the University of California Retirement Plan (UCRP) for certain former employees of the UC at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and their eligible beneficiaries. The work described in the attachments cannot be performed by any entity other than UC unless the government expended considerable legal and actuarial expenses to remove the interests of the former UC employees at LANL and LLNL from the UCRP and subsequently established a private sector pension plan that provides the same benefits as the UCRP. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 525110.
<p>The UC managed and operated LANL for the Department of Energy pursuant to Contract W-7405-ENG-36 from January 1, 1943, until May 31, 2006. UC also managed and operated LLNL for the Department of Energy pursuant to Contract W-7405-ENG-48 from September 2, 1952, until September 30, 2007. NNSA awarded Los Alamos National Security, LLC (LANS), a limited liability corporation, the contract to manage and operate LANL and LANS assumed operations of LANL on June 1, 2006. NNSA awarded Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS), also a limited liability corporation, the contract to manage and operate LLNL and LLNS assumed operations of LLNL on October 1, 2007.</p>
<p>During the time that UC operated LANL and LLNL (Laboratories) the employees at the Laboratories were UC employees and participated in the UCRP. The UCRP is a governmental defined benefit plan under the Internal Revenue Code section 414(d) that was established for employees of a state entity, the University of California. After LANS and LLNS (Contractors) were awarded the respective contracts, but before the Contractors assumed full responsibility for operation of the laboratories, the Contractors presented UC employees with the choice to 1) remain in the UCRP as terminated vested participants or 2) participate in a newly established private sector defined benefit pension plan that was designed to offer the same accrued benefits, to the extent practicable given the rules that apply to private sector plans, that were offered under the UCRP. Employees who elected to remain in the UCRP as terminated vested participants in the UCRP as well as retirees from the Laboratories under the UCRP, eligible beneficiaries and other former laboratory employees who have a terminated vested interest in the UCRP comprise the finite universe of UCRP participants whose assets and liabilities are calculated separately from the rest of the participants in the UCRP pursuant to contracts between UC and NNSA.</p>
<p>Though the management and operating duties at LANL now are performed by a private company, pursuant to Contract W-7405-ENG-36, UC must perform accounting and financial reporting for the LANL Retained Segment which is defined in the current contract as "the portion of UCRP represented by the assets and liabilities accrued through May 31, 2006, and associated with the benefits of Retained Members and Beneficiaries." Similarly, at LLNL, pursuant to Contract W-7405-ENG-48, UC must perform accounting and financial reporting for the LLNL Retained Segment which is defined as "the portion of UCRP represented by the assets, including the Contribution Reserve Amount, and liabilities accrued through September 30, 2007, and associated with the benefits of Retained Members and Beneficiaries." Retained Members for both the LANL and LLNL segments are 1) retirees of the UCRP 2) terminated vested participants of the UCRP and 3) disability income recipients under UCRP or deceased participants with respect to any survivor entitled to benefits.</p>
<p>Both contracts require UC to perform the following activities: provide an accounting of the assets in the Retained Segment, submit reports to NNSA that reflect the annual actuarial valuation for the UCRP and for the Retained Segment, submit to NNSA a copy of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 87 report prepared by the UCRP each year and calculate anticipated NNSA contributions for the Retained Segment. In addition, the contracts require UC to administer the UCRP and its trust fund as fiduciaries of the UCRP. Under the contracts, NNSA is obligated to fund the Retained Segments pursuant to the terms set forth in the respective contracts.</p>
<p>The duties set forth in the attached contract sections will be consolidated into one contract and Contracts W-7405-ENG-36 and W-7405-ENG-48 will be closed. Portions of the current contracts pertaining to the Retained Segments with UC are attached to the synopsis for informational purposes.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement action and is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement by June 22, 2010, 4:00 P.M. Mountain Time, to Ms Leticia Potts, Contract Specialist, National Nuclear Security Administration, Office of Business Services, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque, NM 87185; or by e-mail at lpotts@doeal.gov. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NNSA will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the capability information.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis with Barco Incorporated, 3059 Premier Pkwy., Suite 400 Duluth, GA 30097-4905. This synopsis is for a two year period of performance extension to current Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00421-07-G-0004. The contract type will remain a BOA with individual Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Orders placed against it. The requirement will result in an extension of period of performance for two years running from 01 September 2010 through 31 August 2012 for the continuance of repair services to repair flat panel displays for the AN/TPX-42A(V)14 Shipboard Air Traffic Control (ATC) System. The AN/TPX-42A(V) Shipboard ATC System provides automated air traffic control capabilities for aircraft launch, marshal, and recovery operations and provides aircraft identity, altitude and position symbols. The system provides automatic tracking of radar and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) targets that are equipped with Mode 2, Mode 3/A and Mode C transponders. The system is currently in the production phase with 125 units fielded. The flat panel displays are the primary display of air traffic control information for the AN/TPX-42A(V) system. Due to the fact that the government does not have sufficient Technical data to perform these repair services, and the repaired monitors must be exact form, fit, and functional replacements on board ships, Barco Incorporated is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. For information contact Shayne Kenny, Code 2.5.1.2.1.8, Telephone (301) 995-4817 or via e-mail shayne.kenny@navy.mil.

<DESC>***THIS IS A MODIFICATION TO SPECIAL NOTICE NO N0017410SND26***

This notice is issued by the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) NAVEODTECHDIV is hereby posting a Request for Information (RFI) to solicit responses from interested parties for dismounted Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronics Warfare (CREW) systems performance improvements. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR INVITATION FOR BID NOTICE. The document is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition. The Government has a desire to investigate system level hardware that will provide near term improved performance over current systems capabilities.  Improved capabilities shall be defined as those that exceed the requirements defined in the CREW 3.1 specification.  The overarching area of interest is reduction in system weight.  Secondary areas of interest in priority order are reduction in system size, increase in system effectiveness range, and reduction/elimination of noise generated by system fans.  Respondents shall address how improvements to secondary areas of interest affect system weight.  The Government will also consider hardware that addresses unique operational or employment concepts.  It is requested that white papers be submitted that fully describe the capabilities and/or performance improvements in as much detail as possible.  It is requested that the white paper quantify the expected performance improvement and provide a reference for comparison (current system or specification reference).  The proposed improvements should also describe and quantify the impact or effect to, or on, all other system parameters (i.e., whether this improvement results in a change in size, weight, protection zone, mission time, cost, form factor, etc).  Based on the submissions, the Government may elect to conduct one-on-one discussions with Industry based on its analysis of the RFI responses, the quality of submission, and the level and specification of the information provided.    This may include visits to contractor's facilities to assess first hand the validity of described capabilities.  A laboratory demonstration at the contractor facility may also be requested.  The purpose of the discussions/site visit will be to assess the validity of the vendor's assertions regarding improved performance.  Those capabilities that show promise may be selected for additional testing at Government locations.  The additional testing will be pursued outside of this RFI.   Test results from closed loop or range testing will be releasable to a variety of DoD activities .   Please note the Government is under no obligation to conduct these sessions, or is it liable for any costs or expenses incurred in replying to this RFI.  The information provided in response to this RFI will be used to support on-going initiatives within DoD to analyze emerging requirements for dismounted CREW systems and ultimately may result in the Government developing and issuing a RFP for respondents. 
Response Date:  Parties may begin submitting responses to this request for information immediately.  Submissions are due by 1600 hours Eastern Daylight Time on 16 July 2010.  Responses received after 16 July 2010, will be reviewed on six month intervals for the next two years.  Final review of submissions will be conducted 30 July 2012.    Responses shall be sent via email to:   Omar Roque at omar.roque@navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Assessment Group intends request a quotation from Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation, a nonprofit organization, for the purpose of awarding a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract to design and code a module to receive data from and supply data to the Distributed Common Access Database System (commonly known as SNARES),which is government-owned software, for the purpose of providing additional capability to manage program and budget information, personnel access information, program security information, cover support requirements, treaty related requirements, and archiving requirements for programs under the oversight of the Director of Special Programs. The resulting module will produce the 1200+ page Congressional Special Access Program Annual report and various smaller supporting reports. The government expects the resulting contract to have a period of performance from the date of award through September 2011. The first software deliverable will be in September 2010. The office for receipt of deliverables under the contract is OUSD (AT&amp;L)/SP. The statutory authority for using other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 USC &sect;2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Use of another source would duplicate cost and unacceptably delay accomplishing the objective of this acquisition. As the author of the SNARES software, which is not publicly available, the proposed source is uniquely qualified by having knowledge of and experience with the software logic and data interconnections in the existing SNARES software. This announcement is not a request for competitive proposals. Any responsible source may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation via e-mail to nag.contracting@kirtland.af.mil, which the agency shall consider. A determination not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the government. The government anticipates contract award prior to 30 June 2010.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

The Offerors shall acknowledge that NIST will not store the equipment onsite before it is installed.

Experience: The offeror shall demonstrate the extent to which it has recently manufactured, distributed, and installed similar equipment. 

Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror intends to subcontract with another firm(s) for part of this requirement, that firm’s past performance information shall also be provided. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.

The description of each contract/order described in this section shall not exceed one half page in length. For each contract/order, the offeror shall provide the following information:

OR

“The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:

Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)

Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC).  If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price.  However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror’s FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price. 

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST’s requirements. 

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror’s experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror’s past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.

Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness, in accordance with 52.217-5.  Price will be evaluated based on the cumulative total of all the line item prices.  

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

A giant manta ray swoops down over the entry door as tiger and Galapagos sharks prowl overhead. The abundant natural life of the NWHI comes alive within the center and the visitor is transported into this remote ocean wilderness where predators still rule the reefs and the skies teem with seabirds.</strong></span></p>

The discovery at French Frigate Shoals is certainly exciting, however, the identity of this unexpected find remains a mystery. What ship could this be trapped on the sea floor beneath the waves at French Frigate Shoals for so long? Only three whaling ships, all American vessels, have been reported lost at French Frigate Shoals: the <em>South Seaman</em>, wrecked in 1859; the <em>Daniel Wood</em>, wrecked in 1867; and the <em>Two Brothers</em>, a Nantucket whaler wrecked in 1823. The <em>Two Brothers</em> was well-known in her time for her ties to the story of the whaler <em>Essex</em>, made famous in recent years by author Nathaniel Philbrick in his bestselling book, <em>In the Heart of the Sea</em>. </strong></span></p>

In 2009, the maritime heritage team returned to the unidentified whaling shipwreck site at French Frigate Shoals (now named the Shark Island Whaler for the sandy island nearby). At this time, the team came across an exciting new portion of the wrecksite. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>In addition to the discovery of a fourth trypot, three blubber hooks, a grinding wheel and a kedge anchor, the team found four small cast iron pots that resemble small trypots. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The team also came across what appears to be the tip of a whaling harpoon, another exciting discovery. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Because of the potential for this whaling harpoon tip to identify this shipwreck site, it was determined that it will be recovered in during fieldwork in May of 2010, and conserved and treated for display and outreach. An important reason for the recovery of this possible harpoon tip is its potential for education and outreach at Mokupapapa Discovery Center. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>In order to properly include this new artifact in the Lost on a Reef exhibit, interpretive signage, and casing will need to be built to augment the current exhibit. </strong></span></p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&amp;E) is responsible for leading the collection, analysis, and reporting of performance measurement information for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) mission-oriented programs. This information must meet the yearly requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and OMB Circular's A-11 and A-136. GPRA requires that Agencies' publicly reported performance measure information must be reviewed to ensure accurate data collection and reporting. OMB Circulars further stipulate that the Secretary of DHS must assert that all the performance measure information is complete and reliable when issuing Performance and Accountability related reports. During FY 2009, DHS completed a pilot project to develop and implement a methodology to assess the completeness and reliability of a small subset of its GPRA performance measures as part of a two-pronged approach to establish an internal controls process over performance information. For the purposes of this scope of work, the assessment process will be updated to include the findings of the pilot and then implemented on a larger sample of Departmental measures to include a review of remedial action implementation.</p>

<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Commander (vpl) USCG Surface Forces Logistics Center</p>
<p>Dockside Repairs of CGC RUSH (WHEC-723)</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-P45HR2 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposals incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40. This is a small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that the Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurements, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT NOTICE: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 1073018 and is issued as an invitation for bids (IFB), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-34. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 811212 with a small business size standard of $25.00M. This requirement is unrestricted and only qualified offerors may submit bids. The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2010-06-09 17:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com.

Questions must be submitted by using the 'Submit a Question' feature at www.fedbid.com. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.***<BR><BR>For this solicitation, DHHS FDA Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. An Offeror may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. DHHS FDA Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services is taking this action in an effort to improve both vendor access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, competed, real-time bids. All responsible Offerors that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com. Offerors that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Offerors that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process. Should offerors require additional clarification, notify the point of contact or FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR><BR> New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.  All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty.<BR><BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy.<BR><BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination.<BR><BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.<BR><BR>Delivery must be made within 30 days or less after receipt of order (ARO).  The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 30 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer.<BR><BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>The item to be acquired is a modified version of the software package known as ProTrawler/Regatta.  This software package was produced for the FDA by Bioanalyte, Inc. over the course of several years.  The purpose of this package is to analyze data from experiments which are being conducted at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition to analyze bacteria using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.  This software package allows us to take experimental data and produce a profile of the proteins present in the sample.  We require a number of modifications to this software, as outlined in the statement of work.  In summary, we are requiring that the software package be modified to allow us to analyze data from different types of instruments (with different file formats), to perform additional calculations and data manipulations, and to modify the software to run in the Apple- Mac operating system known as Snow Leopard, which will allow us to run the software much faster and deal with larger data sets.It is not feasible to obtain these software modifications through full and open competition because ProTrawler/Regatta is a product for which we do not have access to the software code.  Only Bioanalyte, Inc, the developer of the software is capable of modifying it in a useful way.  The original versions of ProTrawler and Regatta were written for our requirements, and while ProTrawler has become a commercial product, it is not widely used.  There are no competitive software packages that can be used to perform the functions available in ProTrawler.  Consequently, while other sources can be sought, it is unlikely that there will be respondents other than BioAnalyte, Inc, since they would be unable to obtain the source code in order to modify the software.  The entire software package would have to be rewritten from scratch by another vendor, and this would require a completely new statement of work, since ProTrawler already has extensive functionality.  Should other vendors bid on this procurement, evaluation of those bids would have to be based on their ability to completely reproduce what already exists in ProTrawler (at no cost, since we have already paid for the development of ProTrawler) and this is unlikely.<BR><BR>

The original versions of ProTrawler and Regatta were written for our requirements, and while ProTrawler has become a commercial product, it is not widely used.  There are no competitive software packages that can be used to perform the functions available in ProTrawler.  Consequently, while other sources can be sought, it is unlikely that there will be respondents other than BioAnalyte, Inc, since they would be unable to obtain the source code in order to modify the software.  The entire software package would have to be rewritten from scratch by another vendor, and this would require a completely new statement of work, since ProTrawler already has extensive functionality.  Should other vendors bid on this procurement, evaluation of those bids would have to be based on their ability to completely reproduce what already exists in ProTrawler (at no cost, since we have already paid for the development of ProTrawler) and this is unlikely.<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Lisa Ko, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-827-5095, Email Lisa.Ko@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to sole source by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA intends to award a purchase order to University of Louisiana at Lafayette: New Iberia Research Center (NIRC), in the amount of $50,200.00. The Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Division of Viral Products requires unique access to chimpanzees for research purposes with deliverables in the form of biological samples and data analysis for their project titled "Studying T-Cell Markers in HCV Re-Challenged Chimpanzees and Association with Clearance." The project requires the use of chimpanzees that have previously recovered from a genotype 1a hepatitis C virus infection and the continuation of studies on one particular animal from an initial vaccine study that was conducted in 2008, specifically animal #91A025. Animal #91A025 recovered from the HCV infection after vaccination and we wish to study further the specific immune responses in this animal if it is again exposed to HCV. <br /><br />Hepatitis C virus (HCV) will be administered i/v to 3 animals that have previously cleared an HCV infection; one of these animals should be animal #91A025. The animals will be maintained and housed by the contractor throughout the study time; all procedures will be performed by contractor staff. The animals will be screened prior to inoculation in an initial health check and blood will be tested in routine chemistry assays by the contractor. The chimpanzees will be isolated from other animals not on study. Blood (weekly) and liver biopsies (every other week) will be obtained and shipped to the FDA for subsequent analysis. Pre challenge samples will be taken for 2 weeks prior to rechallenge and the animal will be followed for 10 weeks post rechallenge. The total study time will be 13 weeks. During this time there will be 13 bleeds and 7 liver biopsies for each animal. A sample of plasma will be retained by the contractor and tested for alanine amino transferase. The results of these tests will be sent to the FDA. The contractor will supply 39 blood samples and 21 liver biopsies from 3 chimpanzees following infection with hepatitis C virus. Animal #91A025 can only be obtained from the New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) and is proprietary to NIRC. The study must be conducted at the same facility for all 3 animals for the results to remain consistent. The vendor is located at P.O. 13610, New Iberia, LA, 70562-3610.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 the Government is contemplating an award on a sole source basis for the following reasons:<br /><br />a. The Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Division of Viral Products requires unique access to chimpanzees for research purposes with deliverables in the form of biological samples and data analysis and the continuation of studies on one particular animal, #91A025 which can only be obtained from the New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) and is proprietary to NIRC.<br /><br />b. There is a current legitimate need for this study and the use of chimpanzees that have previously recovered from a genotype 1a hepatitis C virus infection, one of which is specifically animal #91A025.<br /><br />c. The study must be conducted at the same facility for all 3 animals to result in consistent and valid findings.<br /><br />The NAICS code is 621511. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes, no solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capability to perform these services, which will be considered by the Agency. A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. A solicitation will be issued to University of Louisiana at Lafayette: New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) no less than 15 days after the date of this notice unless the Government determines to conduct a competitive procurement. All written inquiries must be received via email no later than Wednesday, June 16, 2010 at 2PM ET to the attention of Contract Specialist, Lisa Ko at lisa.ko@fda.hhs.gov. No fax or traditional mail submissions shall be accepted.<br />

<DESC>This post is twofold:<br />1. Updating the SOW<br />2. Post Questions and Answers 1 of 2.<br /><br />The following are the&nbsp;Questions and Answers 1 of 2.&nbsp; There is one additional question that will be answered and posted to FBO.gov prior to the&nbsp;submission date of 10 June 2010 at 11:00 AM ET.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />1. Is this project considered a new requirement? <br /><br />The Basic HUMINT Targeting Course&nbsp;has been performed under contract for the last 5 years. However, due to the large&nbsp;increase in scope, this is&nbsp;viewed as&nbsp;a new requirement. <br /><br />2. If this project is not considered a new requirement;<br />a. Who is the incumbent?<br /><br />Harding Security is the incumbent for the FHTC.<br /><br />b. What is the contract number?<br /><br />HHM402-05-M-0271<br /><br />3. Can I get clarification on the level of facility clearance required for solicitation HHM402-10-R-0132? The SOW states in section 4.1 that facilities must have SECRET and the solicitation DD254 states in section 1(a) that TS is required.<br /><br />Facility Clearance required for this contract is TOP SECRET. SOW dated 03 June 2010 correctly states section 4.1<br /><br />4. Is it possible to substitute work experience for the level of education <br />needed for the key personnel in section 5.0 of the SOW?<br /><br />No. Key Personnel require both education and experience as specified in section 5.0.<br /><br />5. Reference: SF 1449, Block 8 lists offer due date as JUN 10, 2010 11:00 AM ET and page 3 of the Schedule lists: Proposals shall be submitted via email to emily.weir@dia.mil NLT 10:00AM ET on June 10, 2010. <br /><br />Question: Request the Government clarify the time that proposals shall be submitted.<br /><br />Proposal submission date is 10 JUN 2010 at 11:00AM ET.<br /><br />6. Reference: DD 254, Block 1a states a "Top Secret" facility clearance is required. The SOW, paragraph 4.1 states all contractor facilities must have a facility clearance of "Secret". <br /><br />Question: Request the Government clarify the type of facility clearance required. <br />Facility Clearance required is TOP SECRET.<br /><br />7. Reference: SOW, paragraph 3. Scope of Work, states that FHTC and AHTC courses will be delivered when requested. <br /><br />Question: Request the Government provide an estimate of the number of training evolutions for each course during a 12 month period. <br /><br />FHTC and AHTC courses will be delivered according to the current Agency and mission needs.<br /><br />8. Reference: SOW, paragraph 4.10 states "The contractor will ensure the courses are designed and developed consistent with IC HUMINT mission objectives."<br /><br />Question: Request the Government identify the mission objectives or provide a reference where they are itemized.
<p>Specific Mission objectives are classified.<br /><br />9. Reference: SOW, paragraph 4.12 states "The contractor will update the FHTC and AHTC curriculum, as necessary, in order to train in current targeting tactics, methods, and practices. " SOW paragraph 5.6 states "Upon the finalized and approved curriculum, these FTE will no longer be required. These FTE will not be required for any following option years awarded to the contractor."<br /><br />Question: Without additional curriculum developer level of effort no additional updates can be provided after pilot course development. Is it the Government's intention that no curriculum updates will be needed after curriculum is finalized and approved at the end of the pilot courses? <br /><br />The additional course developers will be used only to initially build the two courses. Any additional course updates to both FHTC and/or AHTC will be the responsibility of the remaining course instructors.<br /><br />10. Reference: SOW, Paragraph 7.1 states that "The contractor will submit resumes and other qualifications of key personnel for review and approval by the COR and Government Technical Representative no later than ten days after award of the contract." Additional Instructions, paragraph 1.3.3 states "The resumes for key personnel shall be included in this section (Technical Volume) <br /><br />Question: Request the Government clarify if resumes for key personnel are required in the proposal or after award.<br /><br />Please provide up to five (5) resumes of key personnel with the proposal. <br />Resumes can consist of any combination of instructors or curriculum developers. The contractor will need to submit the remaining resumes and other qualifications of key personnel for review and approval by the COR and Government Technical Representative no later than ten days after award of the contract.<br /><br />11. Reference: SOW, paragraph 7.6 states "The contractor will provide the COR critique feedback after each class..."<br /><br />Question: What, specifically, is the feedback expected by and acceptable to the COR?</p>
<p>Student feedback will consist of comments/ratings on material relevancy, instructor performance, and other such factors. The contractor will then provide the feedback to the Government COR. See revised section 7.7 in SOW.<br /><br />12. Reference: SOW, paragraph 8.3 states "DIA/DH will provide work stations to include client work stations, work space and phone access for the contractor(s) to conduct their work in preparation for instruction, curriculum development, curriculum enhancement and all work conducted outside the classroom."<br /><br />Question: Will curriculum development be done entirely on client site and in classified workspaces or is there flexibility on venue recognizing that some curriculum development work may be unclassified?<br /><br />All curriculum developers will work on the Government site.<br /><br />13. Reference: SOW, paragraph 11.0 states "Contractor performance will take place on site at a Government facility in the Washington DC area." <br /><br />Question: What is the location of the primary place of performance for this project? <br /><br />DIA Hqs, Bolling Air Force Base<br /><br />14. Would the government consider extending the due date to June 18, 2010?<br />No. <br /><br />15. What is the clearance level requirement for the curriculum developers? <br /><br />TS/SCI<br /><br />16. The government has indicated that this is a firm fixed price effort. Are contractors required to provide GSA, or other government approved, labor categories?<br /><br />No. Labor categories are specified in section 5.0 of the SOW and in the Schedule of the SF1449. A breakdown of hourly rates is required as part of price proposal. <br /><br />17. What specific certifications are required for the Palantir instructor position?<br /><br />The Palantir instructor is expected to have a Palantir instructor certification certificate issued by Palantir.<br /><br />18. Are there specific mobile training team requirements?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />19. Does the government place more value on the contractors experience providing classroom instruction or intelligence support experience?<br /><br />The USG places more value on contractors with intelligence support experience relevant to the contract rather than contractors with classroom instruction experience. It is expected that contractors with the right intel support experience will have the professional ability to perform satisfactory classroom instruction.<br /><br />20. Are any specific outreach activities required by the government?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />21. Is travel funding included under the ODCs? If so, is the travel intended for only instructors, or guest speakers, or any other specific activity such as MTTs?<br /><br />No travel funds under the ODCs. No MTTs.<br /><br />22. What specific costs does the government anticipate to be paid under ODCs? <br /><br />ODCs shall include, but are not limited to Palantir licenses, ARGIS software licenses, course material, handouts, and instructional aides.<br /><br />23. Paragraph 6.3 states that the contractor should be prepared to provide resumes of the proposed primary instructors and curriculum developers. Are resumes for the 4 curriculum developers expected to be included in the technical volume along with the 5 key instructor resumes?<br /><br />See answer to question 10.<br /><br />24. Is there a page limit for each resume?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />25.&nbsp; Reference: SOW, paragraph 3.2 states "The contractor will develop AHTC curriculum based on AHTC POI and Government guidance and deliver, when requested, a four week AHTC course". SOW, paragraph 7.0 does not list a deliverable for AHTC curriculum.</p>
<p>Question: If AHTC curriculum is a deliverable request the Government identify it as a deliverable and the timeframe when it is to be completed.<br />The AHTC curriculum shall be delivered no later than 90 days after award of the contract.</p>

As of midday 7 Jun 2010, no offerors had made appointments or submitted visit requests; therefore, the Contracting Officer has determined that the need for such an event has significantly diminished since the Pre-Proposal Conference of 13 May 2010 during which several requests for the trial fittings were requested.

<DESC>1.  Several technical issues have been brought to the government's attention and to quickly resolve them the following is synopsized. A formal amendment will be published shortly.<BR><BR>2. Tactile Bead Requirement for Proposal Demonstration Model (bid sample) changes:<BR>   A. Additional Source for Tactile Bead: Only one suggested source was identified on drawing 1005843 as a supplier for the tactile bead 1005843-1. Another source of supply for tactile bead 1005843-1 is Switlik Parachute Co., Inc., 1325 East State Street, Trenton, NJ 08609, (609) 587-3300 X-114, fax (609) 586-6647, Part Number is 90-072.<BR>   B. Change to the Proposal Demonstration Model (Bid Sample) - The Government will not grade the samples bead compliance to the drawing. Because the minimum purchase and color requirement may limit availability in the short term, any alternative placeholder for the tactile bead may be used in the bid sample. Some alternative suggestions are as follows  1. Drill out a rubber bumper http://www.mcmaster.com/#9305k21/=7fhbgg, 2. Spacers - use in place of tubular beads http://www.mcmaster.com/#92825a129/=7fhhsy, 3. Cut plastic/rubber tubing into beads, 4. Counting Knots (for telling ship's  speed), or 5. Ball Buttons<BR><BR>3. SKRAM Bag and M-4 Magazine Pouch Material:<BR>   A.  AVNS-DTL-10836A describes the requirements for the SKRAM bag and lists the fabric to be used in manufacture as 1000 Denier IAW Drawing 1005936-3.<BR>   B. The M-4 magazine pouch drawing 1005845 cites the fabrics to be used in manufacture IAW Drawing 1005937 and Drawing 1005936-1 (the 500 denier). The M-4 magazine pouch uses both fabrics, an FR Ripstop and an FR Nylon.  The vendors for these two fabrics are listed on the pertinent fabric drawing.<BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to correct the point of contact's email address to Mike.Dalessandro@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division in support of the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, has a requirement to acquire integrated short-range, low-bandwidth, wearable communications, sensing, and networking technologies that will enable the analysis, display, and remote monitoring of summary activity, physiologic, and geo-location data from free-roaming dismounted Warfighters in a variety of austere military training settings. These technologies will be used to improve the safety and effectiveness of training, decrease the likelihood of environmentally-induced injuries, and speed evacuation in the event of illness or injury. The envisioned network topology is three-tiered and includes an on-body bi-directional wireless Personal Area Network (PAN) integrated with a Squad Area Network (SAN) that links individual trainees with their instructor/squad leader. The third tier is formed by a repeater backbone capable of relaying data from a SAN to a central Tactical Operations Center (TOC). Bandwidth and message rate requirements are intentionally modest with a desired status update rate under optimal conditions of once per minute per connected Warfighter. No video data or real-time voice will be carried by this network. The overall design must to adhere to a minimalist philosophy of simplicity, robustness, technological transparency to the Government, openness to new third-party sensors and algorithms, and ease of maintenance. Networking technologies desired generally fall into the category of mobile, ad-hoc, delay/disruption-tolerant mesh networks. A fully operational prototype network compromising a minimum of 5 Trainee Nodes, 1 Instructor Node, 1 Repeater Node, and 1 Tactical Operations Center Node that includes user interface and network management software, is desired at the end of the first year. The work effort for year two (Option Year 1), and year three (Option Year 2) will focus on scaling the system to Platoon and Company level applications, respectively. Each node must be capable of hosting Government-furnished health state classification algorithms and of storing both physiologic and network performance data for later analysis. The system and its underlying technologies must ultimately be scalable for simultaneous use by Battalion-sized groups. The communications technologies underlying the SAN and repeater backbone must operate in the 225 380 MHz military band and be capable of generating and receiving signals with 12.5 KHz to 25 KHz occupied bandwidth channels. Because of the potential need for band and frequency agility, and to facilitate future system upgrades, software defined radios are required. Because of their greatly reduced or absent radio-frequency emissions, short-range, inductive-based wireless technologies are required for the PAN. The overall integrated system must be capable of operating in a completely self-contained mode, not relying on any fixed infrastructure. Repeater nodes must be capable of being deployed and retrieved by two person teams. No major subsystem may rely on any proprietary third-party technology. The system must be designed to be set up and operated solely by resident Training Cadre as part of their normal training exercises. The overall design of the system and its sub-components must facilitate future adaptations to changing military operational and research needs and accommodate small-volume applications, while still adhering to the overall minimalist concept of the system as a whole. This procurement will be 100% Small Business Set-Aside and all offerors must meet the definition of Small Business Concern as defined in FAR 19.001. The North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) Code for this procurement is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee type contract will be awarded. In accordance with FAR 16.301-3, for an anticipated cost type contract to be awarded, potential offerors must ensure that they have an adequate accounting system, as determined by their cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office. The Government anticipates the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released on or about June 30, 2010. The period of performance for this effort will be for a base period of twelve-months with two one-year option periods. Questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Mr. Michael DAlessandro at Mike.Dalessandro@us.army.mil. All questions must be submitted in writing. When released, the solicitation will only be available in electronic medium at US Army RDECOM Natick Contracting Division at https://www3.natick.army.mil

<DESC>The Office of Migrant Education (OME), within the U.S. Department of Education, may provide a grant to each State Educational Agency (SEA) to administer the Migrant Education Program (MEP) in accordance with Part C of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). Under certain conditions, Section 1307 of the ESEA allows the Secretary to make arrangements with a public or private nonprofit agency to carry out the purposes of the MEP for the benefit of migrant children who reside in a State that is unable or unwilling to operate a MEP. Currently, two States (Connecticut (CT) and Rhode Island (RI)) have chosen to not operate a MEP. With the awarding of the Bypass contract, the OME is exercising its authority under section 1307 to establish a MEP that will identify, recruit, and serve the eligible migrant children who reside in the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island. If necessary, the OME reserves the option of adding additional States to this contract through a supplemental task order and supplemental funding.
<p>The Department requires contractor support to operate a MEP for the benefit of migrant children who reside in the States identified in this PWS (CT and RI) and any other State(s) identified in a subsequent task order(s). These States will be referred to as the "target States" in the remainder of this synopsis. During the base year of the contract, the contractor shall perform the following major tasks: (1) create and implement an effective program design plan and process to identify, recruit, and serve migrant children in the target States; (2) identify and recruit eligible migrant children in the target States; (3) develop a comprehensive needs assessment (CNA) for each target State's children; (4) electronically collect data on identified migrant children and report minimum data elements (MDE) to the Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX); and (5) provide supplemental support services for identified children, including but not limited to, ensuring the exchange of their academic and health information using MSIX.</p>
<p>During the first option year of the contract the contractor shall perform the following major tasks: (1) create and implement a service delivery plan (SDP) that addresses the needs identified in the CNA and are specific for each target State; (2) provide high-quality instructional and support services to migrant children as described in the target State's SDP; (3) perform a program evaluation and identify areas of improvement for each target State; and (4) conduct re-interviews of migrant parents and children for quality control. During the second, third and fourth option years, the contractor shall continue to operate a MEP for each target State, adhering to all requirements in this PWS, in Title I Part C of the statute, and in the MEP regulations (34 CFR) Part 200.81-200.89 and 34 CFR 200.100-103.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award this contract on the basis of best value using Full and Open Competition among public and private nonprofit agencies. It is anticipated that the resulting contract will be a fixed-price-award-fee (FPAF) contract awarded to a single provider with a one-year base period with three (3) one-year option periods. Proposals shall be required within 30 days of the issuance of the RFP. EMAIL INQUIRIES IN LIEU OF TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED. Electronic submissions will be accepted and should be directed to the following e-mail address: jason.wilson@ed.gov. Please include the name of a point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number and facsimile number. Questions will be addressed and posted to the following website: <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>.

<DESC>Department of Education's Answers to Offeror's Technical and Business Questions<br />Design and Conduct of a Study of TRIO Implementation and Outcomes<br />ED-IES-10-R-0015
<p><br />Note from the Department of Education:</p>
<p>The proposals are due on Monday, June 28, 2010 by noon (12:00 PM) (EST). If the proposals are delivered before 9:30 AM, please contact Brian Johnson at 202-245-6206 or Natasha Boyce at 202-245-6128. If the proposals are delivered after 9:30 AM, you could reach Brian Johnson, Natasha Boyce, or William Spitzgo at 202-245-6497.</p>
<p>Each vendor is required to submit total of three volumes: (1) Volume I - Technical proposal, Volume II- Business proposal and Volume III- Past performance reports. Each volume should have one original and four copies.</p>
<p>Past Performance: Please submit minimum of three past performance reports for grants/contracts that were awarded in last three years. In addition you may want to submit subcontractors past performance reports. However, subcontractors past performance reports are optional.</p>
<p>Q1. In Previous Evaluations of Upward Bound and other TRIO Programs, Page 6: In conjunction with the 2007 changes to the targeting of the program, ED launched a second experimental evaluation of the Upward Bound program, which was to focus on the program's impact on higher risk children. ED terminated the evaluation in February 2008 in response to a Congressional ban on spending for the evaluation. Hence, evaluation of participants who entered the program between October 1992 and March 1994 remains the most recent national evaluation of Upward Bound.<br /><br />Will ED release to the Contractor copies of any protocols and/or preliminary findings related to this terminated study? If so, can such protocols and/or preliminary findings be used as sources for protocol development for the current work outlined in this RFP?</p>
<p>Answer to Q1: The contract for the second experimental evaluation was terminated in February 2008 in the midst of the recruitment phase. The contractor had completed the OMB package for the design of the evaluation, which included a form for the collection of baseline student data prior to randomization. The OMB package is attached to this document. No outcomes data was collected.</p>
<p>Q2. Key Research Questions for the Study, Q.10, Page 13: To what extent is there meaningful variation in implementation strategies within Upward Bound grantees and between Upward Bound grantees and other pre-college programs? <br />Does a meaningful or representative list of "other" pre-college programs exist?<br />Will ED assist the contractor in identifying types of "other" pre-college programs?<br />Can ED assist in access to these "other" programs?</p>
<p>Answer to Q2: ED does not have knowledge of a representative list of other pre-college programs. The American Youth Policy Publication, Success at Every Step: How 23 Programs Support Youth on the Path to College and Beyond provides examples of such programs, but is not a representative list. (See http://www.aypf.org/publications/SuccessAtEveryStep.htm.)</p>
<p>If the cooperation of non-TRIO pre-college programs is needed for the design and feasibility phase or the optional evaluation, the contractor will be responsible for gaining access to non-TRIO programs and attaining their cooperation with the study. ED will provide a letter of support for the study that may be useful in the recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>Please note the technical proposal review criteria state that each proposal will be rated on the technical qualifications of the proposed staff, including documentation of substantive knowledge of relevant education issues, including policy and practice of programs (especially Upward Bound and other TRIO programs) designed to promote college attendance and completion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and their documented experience and skill in conducting rigorous research on those programs, including the collection and analysis of detailed data on implementation strategies.</p>
<p>Q3. Will ED contribute names to the list of TWG panelists?</p>
<p>Answer to Q3: The contractor is responsible for submission of the names of the technical working group members. The potential TWG members are subject to the review and approval of the COR. (See Task 2, p. 17 of the Performance Work Statement). ED expects the contractor to have enough substantive and technical expertise to be able to recommend the appropriate panel members.</p>
<p>4. Please clarify the role of TWG. Under subtask 3.1 the proposal states "the COR and the TWG shall review the draft data collection instruments within two weeks" (p. 10). Yet, under Task 6 the proposal states, "The revised feasibility report will provide the basis for discussion during the scheduled TWG meeting." Does the contractor meet with TWG at one time only? Or is the contractor expected to maintain communication with the group throughout the 21 months? If ongoing communication is expected, please explain the role of TWG during the Feasibility Phase.</p>
<p>Answer to Q4: The TWG will meet only once during the feasibility phase. However, the TWG members' consultant agreements with the prime contractor should state that they will be available for review and consultation on key evaluation products, such as data collection instruments, outside of the meetings.</p>
<p>5. Under subtask 3.1 the contractor is expected to pilot test the UB director interview protocol, and under subtask 3.2 it is noted that the contractor can not collect data without OMB approval. Please clarify the expectations of the contractor to pilot test instruments. Can a contractor pilot test any of the protocols or procedures on 9 or fewer programs or individuals before OMB approval? If so, which entity would make the selection of this pilot group of 9, the COR or the Contractor?</p>
<p>Answer to Q5: The pilot test should be conducted on fewer than 9 UB directors so that it is not subject to OMB approval. The contractor will provide a recommended list of UB directors and projects with whom to conduct the survey, and the list will be subject to COR approval.</p>
<p>6. Please explain more about the purpose of the contractor having its own IRB approval (subtask 3.2). While a contractor may not require IRB approval, many colleges and educational institutions do require IRB approval for any studies conducted with their students and/or staff. Would ED assist the Contractor in working with colleges and other educational institutions to acquire their IRB approval in a timely manner?</p>
<p>Answer to Q6: This procurement will include activities involving human subjects that are covered (i.e., not exempt) under the protection of human subjects regulations. Hence, the contractor will be required to provide documentation of review and certification of the project from the contractor's cognizant IRB. (For more information about ED and federal regulations regarding research involving human subjects, see: http://www2.ed.gov/policy/fund/reg/clibrary/humansub.html).</p>
<p>Contracts that are conducted for IES are not required to obtain individual institutions (e.g. school districts/grantees) IRB approval. However, Upward Bound host institutions (including colleges, universities and community organizations), state education agencies, and school districts involved in the full evaluation may require the contractor to submit documents for approval in their own IRBs or research committees. Where applicable, the contractor is responsible for obtaining approval from relevant IRBs or research committees of the sites that will participate in the study.</p>
<p>7. Will ED facilitate communication with critical stakeholders to obtain access to the extant data sources (Task 4), i.e., APR data from Upward Bound grantees, federal Financial Aid records, National Student Clearinghouse data, and Impact Evaluation of Upward Bound files?</p>
<p>Answer to Q7: The COR will provide the following data to the contractor: APR data from Upward Bound grantees and the Impact Evaluation of Upward Bound restricted use data file. The COR will help the contractor access the federal student financial aid records. The contractor will need to purchase data from the National Student Clearinghouse, which is a nonprofit organization. (See http://www.studentclearinghouse.org). Please note that the contractor will need to comply with ED's contractor security screening requirements before it can have access to ED data with personally identifiable information, including the Upward Bound Annual Performance Report data, the data from the Impact Evaluation of Upward Bound, and the federal student financial aid records.</p>
<p>Please note the technical proposal review criteria state that each proposal will be rated on the technical qualifications of the proposed staff, including documentation of experience and skill in the use of data from the National Student Clearinghouse Data and federal Student Financial Aid Records.</p>
<p>8. Will ED facilitate communication with states about their longitudinal student data records system?</p>
<p>Answer to Q8: In the design and feasibility phase, the contractor will be responsible for communication with states and relevant districts about their longitudinal student records systems. ED will provide a letter of support for the study that may be useful in gaining access to state education agencies.</p>
<p>In the optional evaluation phase, the contractor will be responsible for contacting states to recruit them to participate in the study and for obtaining access to state longitudinal data. ED will provide a letter of support for the study that may be useful in the contractor's recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>Please note the technical proposal review criteria state that each proposal will be rated on the technical qualifications of the proposed staff, including their documented experience and skill in gathering and analyzing state or school district longitudinal school records data and their documented experience and skill in gaining cooperation of grantees, states, and high schools for an evaluation effort.</p>
<p>9. Under Task 4, the contractor is expected to develop an analysis plan using "the restricted use files from ED's Impact Evaluation of Upward Bound" to answer several research questions. It is not clear whether the data to answer the questions are available in the Impact Evaluation of Upward Bound. Is ED looking for an analysis plan with the existing data set to answer the questions? If so, should we assume the Impact Evaluation of Upward Bound files contain the necessary data to answer the questions? Or, does ED want the contractor to identify additional data or data sets needed to answer the research questions?</p>
<p>Answer to Q9: The COR will provide the contractor individual student-level data from ED's Impact Evaluation of Upward Bound in the form of a restricted use file. Attachment B to the RFP, the 5th follow-up survey from the Impact Evaluation of Upward Bound, provides information on the types of variables included in the data files. The PWS states that during the design and feasibility phase of the study, the contractor shall design and conduct data analyses using the data from the Impact Evaluation of Upward Bound. Note that instructions to Offerors states "Offerors are encouraged to suggest improvements to the approaches in the PWS, along with a justification of the merits of these alternative approaches." Hence, if the offeror believes the analysis plan would be improved by the inclusion of additional data sets, the offeror may want to suggest and justify the improvements in its proposal.</p>
<p>10. One Task 4 deliverable is an "Analysis Plan for Restricted Use Data from Upward Bound Impact Evaluation." However, under Task 6, it is expected that the feasibility report will include a chapter that uses data from the Upward Bound Impact Evaluation to examine the research questions listed under Task 4. Is the contractor expected to develop a plan (Task 4) and carry out the analyses for the feasibility report?</p>
<p>Answer to Q10: In the design and feasibility phase of the contract, the contractor will develop an analysis plan for the restricted use of the Upward Bound Impact Study, and carry out the analyses. Task 6 of the PWS includes the following language on the feasibility and design report (p. 21): "The report will also include a chapter that uses data from the Impact Evaluation of Upward Bound to examine the extent to which Upward Bound participants and non-participants are served by SSS and McNair as college students and an analysis of the extent to which student outcome (e.g., postsecondary completion rates) varied by project characteristics such as type of host institution (two-year versus four-year college versus community organization) and the selectiveness of the host institution's undergraduate admissions process."</p>
<p>11. Under subtask 5.2, will ED work with the contractor to identify grantees for site visits? Will ED facilitate communication with grantees to help the contractor arrange the site visits?</p>
<p>Answer to Q11: Upon contract award, ED will provide the contractor an electronic list of Upward Bound grantees and the contact information of their project directors. The contractor is responsible for development of a list 20 recommended grantees for the site visits, which is subject to COR approval. Once COR approves the list, ED will send a letter of support for the study that will remind grantees that cooperation with the evaluation is required as a condition of the grant. The contractor will be responsible for contacting and developing cooperative relationships with each of the grantees in order to schedule and conduct the site visits.</p>
<p>Please note the technical proposal review criteria state that each proposal will be rated on the technical qualifications of the proposed staff, including the documented experience and skill in gaining cooperation of grantees, states, and high schools for an evaluation effort. <br />12. Task 17- Collection of Student Surveys and Parental Consent Forms (Cost Plus Award Fee Task), page 31: In fall 2012, prior to the administration of the student survey, the contractor shall obtain active parental consent for the collection of the survey. Is parental consent required for all students or only those under the age of 18?<br />Answer to Q12: Upon further reflection, ED has determined that under federal law, passive consent for the collection of the student survey (for students under the age of 18) will be sufficient. The contractor will only need to obtain active parental consent when it is a grantee or school district requirement. Parental consent is not required for students over the age of 18. <br />13. Our understanding is that the small business prime is required to do 51% of the work. If the small business contracts with an individual consultant for 5% of the work, does that 5% count towards the 51% of the work?<br />Answer to Q13: ED would prefer the prime to do 51% of the work, but it is permissible for the prime to subcontract with a consultant for 5% of the work.<br />14. It is possible to have co-PIs where one PI is from the small business and one PI is from a contracted research company?<br />Answer to Q14: Yes.</p>
<p>15. Are tables included in the 75 page maximum? Do tables need to be double spaced?</p>
<p>Answer to Q15: Yes, tables should be included in the 75-page maximum. Tables do not need to be double spaced.</p>
<p>16. Does IES want the technical and budget approach for the Phase 2?</p>
<p>Answer to Q16: Yes. While many aspects of the evaluation approach will not be determined until the feasibility phase is partially or fully completed, for the purposes of preparing a response to this Statement of Work, the instructions to offerors states that offerors should develop their business and technical proposals based on several assumptions about the features and timelines of the quasi-experimental evaluation of implementation strategies in Upward Bound. See p. 61 of the document labeled "ED-IES-10-0015" for further details.</p>
<p>17. What are the expectations for the length (i.e., number of days) of the 20 site visits to be conducted during Phase 1? Are there particular sites which would be targeted in the 20 visits beyond targeting a diverse set of sites?</p>
<p>Answer to Q17: Offerors should propose the sites to be targeted and the duration of site visits in a manner that they think would best fulfill the technical requirements of the RFP.</p>
<p>18. On page 66, there is a request for 4 recent contracts but on page 68 the request is for three. Should the application include three or four?</p>
<p>Answer to Q18: Please submit minimum of three past performance reports for grants/contracts that were awarded in last three years. In addition you may want to submit subcontractors past performance reports. However, subcontractors past performance reports are optional.</p>
<p>19. Must all tables and figures be paginated within the technical proposal page limitations?</p>
<p>Answer to Q19: Yes, all tables and figures may be paginated within the technical proposal page limitations.</p>
<p>20. May tables and figures use reduced font sizes?</p>
<p>Answer to Q20: Yes, Figures and tables may be excluded from the 12-point font requirement, but should use no smaller than an 8-point font.</p>
<p>21. In reading the RFP for the TRIO evaluation on page 61 there is a reference to sampling 2,750 secondary students. However, given that a major goal of Upward Bound is to increase the number of students completing secondary education, continuing to post-secondary education and completing a college education, it seems that it would be crucial to include Upward Bound alumni as well. Would it be acceptable to include alumni of Upward Bound for the past two to three years in addition to the secondary students? Perhaps this question is addressed elsewhere in the materials provided on the fbo.gov site, but I could not find any reference to sampling post-secondary students.</p>
<p>Answer to Q21: On p. 11, the RFP explicitly asks that the contractor's design and feasibility report address possible data collection strategies for "Upward Bound alumni", that is, earlier cohorts of participants. "Given that UB is intended to increase college enrollment and completion, the contractor shall explore evaluation designs in which students from earlier cohorts are linked to more recent data on college enrollment and completion. The challenge of using data from earlier cohorts of participants is that it would need to be linked to implementation data from prior years. OPE has performance report data on college enrollment of select cohorts of UB participants but has not collected information on implementation strategies needed to link the mix of services to outcomes. The contractor shall discuss data collection strategies for implementation data in a design that focused on earlier cohorts."</p>
<p><br />22. The instructions state that the estimated level of effort is approximately 3.5 person years for the base contract and 7 person years for the optional phase, assuming 1 person year = 2,080 hrs. Is this correct: 10.5 person years for the entire contract?</p>
<p>Answer to Q22: Yes.</p>
<p>23. On p. 1 of the Award Fee Evaluation Plan (AFEP), it states that the technical performance of the Contractor will be evaluated on four key deliverables and that the award fee will be capped at $80,000. In the "Award Fee Earnings by Key Deliverable" table on p.6 of the same document, only two deliverables are listed and the maximum fee available appears to be $75,000. Please clarify.</p>
<p>Answer to Q23: The AFEP has been changed to state that the award fee will be capped at $75,000.</p>
<p>24. On p. 3 of the Award Fee Evaluation Plan (AFEP), one of the key deliverables listed to evaluate the contractor's performance is "Small Business Participation - to be evaluated at the end of the fourth year of the contract." Since this procurement is a small business set aside, we are confused by what is meant by this deliverable. Please clarify.</p>
<p>Answer to Q24: The AFEP has been changed to eliminate the reference to small business participation.</p>
<p>25. On p. 3 of the Award Fee Evaluation Plan (AFEP), it states that the COR will use "participant evaluations provided by the contractor to evaluate the contractor's performance." Could you please provide further detail about these evaluations as we are unable to find any other reference to them in the PWS or AFEP.</p>
<p>Answer to Q25: The AFEP has been changed to eliminate the reference to participant evaluations.</p>
<p>26. On page 11, Section B.4, reference is made to the number of months for review for the award fee. The number of months in missing.</p>
<p>Answer to Q26: Award fee evaluation will be conducted at the end of the contract therefore the number of months was left blank.</p>
<p>27. Should past performance materials submitted per sections L and M be bound separately or included as part of the Technical Proposal. Page 66 indicates materials should be submitted "as a separately bound part of its proposal" while p. 68 indicates Past Performance shall be included in the Technical Proposal. If included in the Technical Proposal, does it count against the 75-page limit?</p>
<p>Answer to Q27: Each vendor is required to submit total of three volumes: (1) Volume I - Technical proposal, Volume II- Business proposal and Volume III- Past performance reports. Each volume should have one original and four copies. Please submit minimum of three past performance reports for grants/contracts that were awarded in last three years. The past performance materials will not count against the 75-page limit for the technical proposals. The past performance materials will not count against the 75-page limit for the technical proposals.</p>
<p>28. The cost proposal instructions (pages 64 and 65 of the RFP) indicate that offerors and their subcontractors should provide detailed information to support the cost proposal and should not use fully loaded labor rates for the purposes of costing. We are assuming, and want to confirm, that this requirement is applicable to the cost reimbursable tasks only, as such level of cost detail is inconsistent with FAR regulations in 15.403 regarding competitive fixed price elements of this proposed contract.</p>
<p>Answer to Q28: This requirement is applicable to the fixed price tasks and cost reimbursement tasks. The Department of Education requests to evaluate the build-up of costs for the fixed price tasks as well.</p>
<p>29. Page 65 also indicates that offerors "may propose 3% base fee and 3% Award fee for cost reimbursement tasks." We respectfully submit that the proposed 6% total fee (assuming 100% of the award fee is achieved) is below the level of typical CPAF contracts. In particular, it is lower than the total potential fee offered in IES research contracts over the past 8 years. May offerors propose different base and award fee percentages consistent with this practice, with the understanding that the Government will ultimately award to the offeror it considers as providing the best overall value to the Government?</p>
<p>Answer to Q29: The Department of Education intends to award a 3% base fee for the Cost Reimbursement tasks based on the competitive nature of the procurement. Offerors may propose above or below the base fee anticipated by the Department. Award fees will be fixed to the amounts in the Award Fee Plan (Total $75,000).</p>
<p>30. On page 65 the RFP appears to suggest that a fee of 3% should be applied to fixed price tasks. This is inconsistent with the FAR, which only speaks to profit limitations on cost type contracts. It is also inconsistent with well established industry practices regarding reasonable profit rates for fixed price contracts. Because all of the financial and performance risk is assumed by the contractor under a fixed price arrangement, profit rates are typically higher than for cost reimbursable contracts. Could the Department please clarify this statement?</p>
<p>Answer to Q30: The Department of Education wishes to clarify that only the Award fee amounts are fixed in the Award Fee Plan. All other fees shall be negotiated.</p>
<p>31. For consistency in budgeting the evaluation phase, how many Upward Bound target schools should be assumed to be in the sample (target and comparison) for each of the 45 grantees?</p>
<p>Answer to Q31: Please assume that 10 Upward Bound target schools will be in the sample for each of the 45 grantees.</p>

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government&rsquo;s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice CAUTION NOTICE In the past, most Best Value Clothing and Textile solicitations utilized Best Value Trade Off Procedures, however, This acquisition is utilizing the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Best Value Method. As such, no "trade off" applies and the Government intends to award to the low priced firm who is compliant with terms of the solicitation, and deemed "technically acceptable." There will be no re-submittals for PDM and only firms with satisfactory or better PDMs will be eligible for award. Technical Acceptability is being defined herein as satisfactory, very good or exceptional PDMs. All PDMs will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria outlined in the solicitation. From among technically acceptable firms, the Government will then select the lowest price offeror and determine if that firm is responsible, complies with terms and conditions of the solicitation and an award to them is in the best interest of the Government. If that firm fits these criteria, award will be made to them. If not, the Government will review each subsequent technically acceptable low priced offer until one is identified that does meet the criteria, in which case award will be made to that firm. The Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with a competitive range group of offerors from among technically acceptable firms, based on price. If negotiations are conducted, award will be made to low priced offer (based on final proposal revision closing, date/time) that is technically acceptable, responsible and compliant with solicitation terms and conditions.

<DESC>This project involves the following work.

1.)	The cutting to specifications of 87 acres of vegetation, including trees and shrubs, in preparation for treatment by Removal by Cable Yarding (Highlead or Skyline) or Hand Treatment Methods. From Units 150 and 246 (a total of 27 acres), the Forest Service has a need for its sole use, the cut trees and chipped materials. Logs, and cut firewood, removed from these Units will be transported to a Designated Process and Storage Area in Kyle Canyon. Chipped materials from Unit 150 will be stockpiled at the Process and Storage Area near Unit 150. All cut and chipped materials from Unit 246, not chipped on site will be transported to the Process and Storage Area in Kyle Canyon. Cut materials from other units may be used by the Forest Service for its sole use when left by the Contractor at Final Acceptance of the Project. In the remaining 60 acres, some units or portions of Units may be suitable for treatment with small Cable Yarding systems. If the Contractors proposal includes a yarding system to be used when treating these acres, including ground-based or cable yarding, these systems may be used, otherwise units will be treated solely by Hand Removal or chip-on-site Techniques.
2.)	Trees and cut material over 1-inch in diameter and 3 feet in length, will be treated by Chip-in-Place methods, or removed from the unit and be further treated by chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Materials removed from the units may also be cut to firewood lengths or logs to 25 feet in length or less, and transported to the Process and Storage Area, and neatly stockpiled. Materials stockpiled in the Process and Storage Areas are the property of the Contractor until the Project is Final Accepted, upon which time ownership transfers to the Forest Service, which may issue permits allowing the Public to remove the materials at a later date or use it for its sole needs. Except in Units 150 and 246, the contractor may allow the public to remove materials from the units or Process and Storage Areas prior to Final Acceptance if removal can be done safely. The Forest Service will write a Work Order stating the conditions of removal and the contractor can have the public attach the Work Order to the load prior to the materials leaving the Unit or the Process and Storage Areas.
3.)	The cutting, pruning, or limbing, of trees to specification and chipping into bins, transported to a Process and Storage Area, unless Chipped-in-Place. 
4.)	The cutting to specification of Shrubs and their treatment by chipping-in-Place or Chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area. Shrubs not listed in preferred species specifications will require cutting to specification also.
5.)	Specific Unit prescriptions follow in this project description.
6.)	In Units selected by the Contractor or designated by the Forest Service to be treated as Chip-in-Place, all cut materials and materials scheduled for treatment, will be chipped-in-place using a chipper deemed most appropriate by the contractor and described in the Request for Proposal (RFP). If contractor proposes to take the chipper into the unit or off an existing road or skidtrail, the machinery must be of the Low Ground or Low Tire Pressure type. The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage, Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
7.)	There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit Prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated. Hand treatment is hand cut, hand carry all cut materials outside the flagged polygon and treated as described in the Schedule of Items. Contractor will not pile any materials inside of these polygons, but chipped materials may be chipped into the polygons if agreed to by the Contracting Officer.
8.)	Polygons are shown on the unit maps provided in the contract or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions, but others may only be flagged on the ground. There is no separate pay item in the Schedule of Items for these areas.
9.)	Trees and Shrubs are defined in the Contract Specifications.
10.)	Except for Units 150 and 246, wood and chips which have been neatly stacked or piled in the Processing and Storage Areas, is the property of the Contractor until Final Acceptance of the Project by the Forest Service. After Final Acceptance any remaining wood and chips may be distributed by the Forest Service under the permitting process or may be utilized by the Forest Service on its Projects.
10.) Quaking Aspen may be found in any unit and when found will require cutting to specification, unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Units which require cutting to specification if Quaking Aspen is present are identified in the Specific Unit Prescriptions.
11.) Units may contain one or more dry washes or Designated Streams. In dry washes, avoid treating Riparian vegetation in and on the banks. No piling of cut vegetation is permitted in or on the banks of dry washes. The Contracting Officer will walk units with the contractor prior to work beginning in units containing dry washes or Designated Streams. Designated Streams are shown on project maps or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions.
12.) Riparian Vegetation does not include Conifer Species.
13.) Residential Housing or other structures are present in many of the units in this project and: H 4 -Table 1. Specified defensible zone space distances are applicable to these areas.
14.)  Access Roads to units and project areas may be primitive and in need of minor repairs. No road improvements will be permitted and access roads that have had work done on them to enable access will be returned to original condition. Any and all work on roads must be approved prior to work being done.
15)  Units in this project will not be released for removal activities all at one time, but instead will be released on a schedule that releases additional units as previously worked in units are completed. Contractor should indicate on the work schedule submitted with the RFP the sequence of units to be worked in and schedule of work and completion.
16.) Pay Item 110 - Tree Removal by Directional Falling Methods.  Trees scheduled for removal have been painted with a number such as (#3). During and after Unit Layout, some of these trees were felled by Home Owners in the area. Contractor will only be paid for actual trees fell and all Directionally Felled trees will be paid for at the bid price. Trees paid for under Pay Item 110, require that the contractor, fall, buck to lengths 20-25 feet, and transport to a Process and Storage Area designated by the Forest Service the cut trees. The designated Process and Storage Area is near the intersection of Highways 157 and 158 behind a locked gate. These trees are the property of the Forest Service. Trees fell under Pay Item 110, are the sole property of the Forest Service. At any time prior to the contractor cutting these trees under Pay Item 110, these trees may be felled by the contractor or others with no compensation to the Contractor. Units may contain Hazardous tress with no number (often painted “cut”) which will require falling for safety reasons. There is no separate Pay Item for these trees and they are the property of the Contractor until Final Acceptance of the Unit or Project.
17) All Units have a Limited Operating Period (LOP) and no work within the Units can occur prior to July 1. Contractor will submit a Work Schedule which demonstrates that all work in Units and on the Project will be completed prior to November 1, 2010.
18.) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer prior to award of this contract, contracts awarded on the Spring Mountain Natural Recreation Area will be considered concurrent with previously awarded contacts. Awarded contracts will not be worked on consecutively. The Notice to Proceed will be issued shortly after award of contract and completion date will not be extended
19) The Schedule of Items contains a pay item for Directional Fell Trees. These trees will be transported to the Process and Storage area provided in Kyle Canyon for use by the Forest Service. Additional trees on and off of the Project area may be designated by the Forest Service for Directional felling, bucking, and transportation to the Process and Storage Area in Kyle Canyon.
20.)  At the Prework meeting, the contractor will submit a work schedule indicating how they will complete the contract within the contract time. Each week the work schedule will be reviewed. If the work schedule does not indicate that the contract will be completed within the contract time, the contractor will adjust the workforce and methods of work, to complete the contracted work within the contract time.

<DESC>The Spring Mountains Recreation Area in Southern Nevada is soliciting companies to perform fuels treatment work as described.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be available on or around MARCH 9, 2010.  Persons interested should place themselves on the interested vendors list so they will receive updates from FBO.  The solicitation will contain all necessary information, and will be posted at this site for download by interested vendors.

a.	This project involves the following work.

1.)	The cutting to specifications of 108.2 acres of vegetation, including trees and shrubs, in preparation for treatment by Hand Treatment Methods. Some units or portions of Units may be suitable for treatment with small Cable Yarding systems. If Contractors proposal includes a yarding system, including ground-based or cable yarding, these systems may be used, otherwise units will be treated solely by Hand Removal Techniques.
2.)	Trees and cut material over 1-inch in diameter and 3 feet in length, will be treated by Chip-in-Place methods, or removed from the unit and be further treated by chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area provided by the Forest Service. Materials removed from the units may also be cut to firewood lengths or logs to 25 feet in length or less, and transported to the Process and Storage Area, and neatly stockpiled. Materials stockpiled in the Process and Storage Areas are the property of the Contractor until the Project is Final Accepted, upon which time ownership transfers to the Forest Service, which may issue permits allowing the Public to remove the materials at a later date, or may use the materials on Forest Service Projects. The contractor may allow the public to remove materials from the units prior to Final Acceptance if removal can be done safely. The Forest Service will write a Work Order stating the conditions of removal and the contractor can have the public attach the Work Order to the load prior to the materials leaving the Unit.
3.)	The cutting, pruning, or limbing, of trees to specification and chipping into bins, or transported to a Process and Storage Area, unless Chipped-in-Place. 
4.)	The cutting to specification of Shrubs and their treatment by chipping-in-Place or Chipping into bins and transported to a Process and Storage Area. Shrubs not listed in preferred species specifications will require cutting to specification also.
5.)	Specific Unit prescriptions follow in this project description.
6.)	In Units selected by the Contractor or designated by the Forest Service to be treated as Chip-in-Place, all cut materials and materials scheduled for treatment, will be chipped-in-place using a chipper deemed most appropriate by the contractor and described in the Request for Proposal (RFP). If contractor proposes to take the chipper into the unit or off an existing road or skidtrail, the machinery must be of the Low Ground or Low Tire Pressure type. The specifications of these machines should be submitted with the RFP. In all units and acreage, Skid Steers, Bobcats or similar equipment will be limited to ground slopes of 25% or less. This type of equipment may be used on steeper slopes if used for limited entry to transport chipping machinery. No Skid Steers or Bobcats may be used to transport material to the chipping unit if the grade is greater than 25% or if the Forest Service observes excessive ground disturbance. The Forest Service reserves the right to decide when excessive ground disturbance is occurring. 
7.)	There may be polygons flagged in some units which require special treatment. These polygons are flagged in red or other colors and will be designated on the ground and reviewed with the contractor by the Contracting Officer prior to work beginning in each unit. See Specific Unit prescriptions. Flagged polygons under 1/10 of an acre may be left untreated if flagged in red. Flagged Polygons larger than 1/10 acre or flagged in colors other than red are to be hand treated. Hand treatment is hand cut, hand carry all cut materials outside the flagged polygon and treated as described in the Schedule of Items. Contractor will not pile any materials inside of these polygons, but chipped materials may be chipped into the polygons if agreed to by the Contracting Officer.
8.)	Polygons are shown on the unit maps provided in the contract or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions, but others may only be flagged on the ground. There is no separate pay item in the Schedule of Items for these areas.
9.)	Trees and Shrubs are defined in the Contract Specifications.
11)Wood and Chips which have been neatly stacked or piled in the Processing and Storage Areas, is the property of the Contractor until Final Acceptance of the Project by the Forest Service. After Final Acceptance any remaining wood and chips may be distributed by the Forest Service under the permitting process, or may use the materials on Forest Service Projects
10.) Quaking Aspen may be found in any unit and when found will require cutting to specification, unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Units which require cutting to specification if Quaking Aspen is present are identified in the Specific Unit Prescriptions.
12.) Units may contain one or more dry washes or Designated Streams. In dry washes, avoid treating Riparian vegetation in and on the banks. No piling of cut vegetation is permitted in or on the banks of dry washes. The Contracting Officer will walk units with the contractor prior to work beginning in units containing dry washes or Designated Streams. Designated Streams are shown on project maps or described in the Specific Unit Prescriptions.
13.) Riparian Vegetation does not include Conifer Species.
14.) Residential Housing is present in many of the units in this project and:
H 4 -- Table 1. Specified defensible zone space distances is applicable to these areas.
15.)  Access Roads to units and project areas may be primitive and in need of minor repairs. No road improvements will be permitted and access roads that have had work done on them to enable access will be returned to original condition. Any and all work on roads must be approved prior to work being done.
16)  Units in this project will not be released for removal activities all at one time, but instead will be released on a schedule that releases units as previously worked in units are completed. Contractor should indicate on the work schedule submitted with the RFP the sequence of units to be worked in and schedule of work and completion.
17.)   Unless otherwise agreed to by the Contracting Officer prior to award of this contract, contracts awarded on the Spring Mountain Natural Recreation Area will be considered concurrent with previously awarded contacts. Awarded contracts will not be worked on consecutively. The Notice to Proceed will be issued shortly after award of contract and completion date will not be extended. 

ITEM 125

Acres in Units Treated by Cut and Pile Methods Only.
It is the intention of the Forest Service to chip-in-place, or remove to a Designated Storage Area any cut materials created by contractor operations. Units described in the Schedule of Items as: Acre Cut to Specification for Fuels Removal. Cut Materials Removed by Accepted Proposal Method. Cut Materials Processed by Chipping on Site or Removed, may contain acreage which cannot be treated successfully by the Contractors Proposed Method. The Forest Service recognizes that the Contractor may encounter acreage which can only be treated by the Cutting and Piling Treatment Method, in preparation for burning by the Forest 

Service at a later date. The Forest Service expects a minimum of 75% of the acreage in each unit, to be treated by the Proposed Method of the contractor. The contractor should therefore propose a price per acre to Cut and Pile the cut material and expect this bid price to be applied to any and all acreage that can only be Cut and Piled to specification. Contractor understands that the acreage that can be cut and piled cannot exceed 25% of the unit acreage.  
The intent of this contract is to provide for the complete removal of all Fire Fuels from the Units, and transported to designated Process and Storage areas. The intent of this contract is to prepare any remaining acres which have piles to be burned by Forest Service Fire Personnel the following Fall and Winter. Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, transportation, and supplies and perform all work required to complete the project in accordance with drawings, specifications, and provisions of the contract.

Payment for work will ONLY be made for and under those pay items included in the Schedule of Items. ALL other work and materials will be considered as incidental to and included in the payment for items shown.

 The material to be pruned, cut, piled, chipped-in-place, or removed from the unit and transported to a process and storage area are shrubs and small trees. Trees to be pruned are of all diameter classes. Only trees 14-inches or less at 4.5 feet above the ground (DBH) will be cut and are scheduled for removal. Hazard trees above 14-inches DBH will be removed also. The 120 day contract period will be contiguous, and will begin between April 15th (or when the snow has melted sufficiently to allow work) and May 1st.
 This pre-solicitation notice is for a unit-based performance service contract on approximately 69.9 acres, plus mobilization. In Units designated as: Acre Cut to Specification for Fuels Removal, Cut Materials Removed by Accepted Proposal Method, Cut Materials Processed by Chipping on Site or Removed, The Forest Service will accept and evaluate Proposed Methodology and award the contract to the successful bidder. Prior to submitting a response to the Request for Proposal, contractor will be required to do a Walk Through with the Contract Administrator. The Forest Service may require that a potential successful bidder meet with the Contracting Officer and discuss the contractor’s proposal. This will be a 120 day contract and no extensions will be granted. Contractor will be expected to begin contract compliance with a work crew sufficient to complete the project in the designated timeframe.
Contractor may allow the Public to remove handcut trees and chips or choose to remove handcut trees from Government lands. At final acceptance of unit or project all handcut material becomes the property of the Forest Service. The contract requires the Contractor to furnish all labor, equipment, transportation, supplies, supervision, and incidentals necessary to achieve the objectives.  All work shall be performed during daylight hours, and shall not exceed 10 hours in one day.  A Traffic Control Plan and a weekly updated work schedule will be required prior to beginning the project.

ITEM 120

  Acres in Units Treated by Cut and Pile Methods Only.

It is the intention of the Forest Service to chip-in-place, or remove to a Designated Storage Area any cut materials created by contractor operations. Units described in the Schedule of Items as: Acre Cut to Specification for Fuels Removal. Cut Materials Removed by Accepted Proposal Method. Cut Materials Processed by Chipping on Site or Removed, may contain acreage which cannot be treated successfully by the Contractors Proposed Method. The Forest Service recognizes that the Contractor may encounter acreage which can only be treated by the Cutting and Piling Treatment Method, in preparation for burning by the Forest 

Service at a later date. The Forest Service expects a minimum of 75% of the acreage in each unit, to be treated by the Proposed Method of the contractor. The contractor should therefore propose a price per acre to Cut and Pile the cut material and expect this bid price to be applied to any and all acreage that can only be Cut and Piled to specification. Contractor understands that the acreage that can be cut and piled cannot exceed 25% of the unit acreage.  
The intent of this contract is to provide for the complete preparation of the area by removing from the Units all cut materials unless materials must be prepared prior to the piles being burned by Forest Service Fire Personnel. Unless otherwise provided, the Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment, tools, transportation, and supplies and perform all work required to complete the project in accordance with drawings, specifications, and provisions of the contract.

Payment for work will ONLY be made for and under those pay items included in the Schedule of Items. ALL other work and materials will be considered as incidental to and included in the payment for items shown.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Email questions in writing to <a href="mailto:konevas@mai.nih.gov">konevas@mai.nih.gov</a> by 2:00 (EDT) June 8, 2010.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of standardized, high-quality biospecimens is widely recognized as a significant roadblock to cancer research. The National Cancer Institute (NCI), through its Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research (OBBR), is leading a national initiative to systematically address and resolve one of the most difficult problems that will drive 21st century cancer research: the limited availability of carefully collected and controlled, high-quality human biospecimens annotated with essential clinical data and properly consented for broad investigational use. This issue has been repeatedly identified by the scientific community as a leading obstacle to progress in post-genomics cancer research, and the NCI is committed to resolving this complex problem through a multifaceted approach that addresses those factors under our control and provides insights that will inform broader policy making in this area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The NCI through its Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (NCI CBIIT) has sponsored the development of the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid&reg; (caBIG&reg;) initiative, a common informatics infrastructure that incorporates and encourages the use of common data standards. caBIG&reg; is an open source, open access information network connecting the cancer research community and enabling the sharing of data and tools. Using the caBIG&reg; infrastructure, researchers and clinicians can accelerate their ability to share, integrate and analyze data. By providing a comprehensive collection of interoperable software tools, data standards, and computing infrastructure, the caBIG&reg; initiative promotes data and knowledge exchange, simplifies collaboration, and ultimately helps realize the potential of molecular medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing NCI Specimen Resource Locator (SRL) is the product from the NCI Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) to create a cancer-focused locator service. Despite a low level of maintenance the use and wide sources of inquiries for this application has remained relatively consistent over time signifying an unfulfilled need for the locating specimens effectively. While the present SRL makes no use of caBIG&reg; technology the next phase will employ several including but not limited to: caGrid, Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository (caDSR), Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS), and the caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK). This will enable the creation and sharing of Common Biorepository Model (CBM) grid nodes at biorepositories in a revised SRL and allow for the sharing of de-identified summary-level specimen collection information. In addition, this will also enable the use of other caBIG&reg; compatible systems (such as caTissue Suite and caHUB Portal) and non-caBIG&reg; applications to use CBM as a service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of this RFP is the ongoing development of SRL. The initial focus of the contract will be on the Common Biorepository Model followed by the SRL web application with any needed architecture or updates to support the proposed SRL components. CBIIT has adopted a modified Unified Process Framework (UPF) methodology for software development. Each release cycle of the product can be divided in four phases - inception, elaboration, construction and transition. While individual teams may propose to employ various versions of UPF (e.g., Agile, Extreme or a more traditional RUP style development cycle), the goal is to build and deliver software iteratively with transparent methodologies and clear milestones to avoid a "waterfall" like development cycle. It is expected that there will approximately two release cycles per contract year over the total Period of Performance.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 2

CLARIFICATION: 
If a vendor seeks to be considered for more than one geographic area, do not submit multiple SF 330’s.  Rather, submit only one but be sure to adequately address any evaluation factors that are affected by geography/locality (i.e.  evaluation factors 2, 3 and 5).  For example, if an offeror seeks to be considered for Area 1 and 2, each evaluation factor (i.e. capacity to accomplish the work in the required performance time) should separately address each Area 1, then 2, so that it is clearly understood how the offeror is qualified and plans to address resource issues for each area.

Also, since offerors may submit for consideration for multiple areas and potentially rank highest in more than one area, offerors should provide an order of preference for the areas so they will be contacted regarding the area they are most interested in first, since an offeror can only be awarded one contract as a result of this notice.




AMENDMENT 1
Administrative update to notice to add the state of Minnesota to the location section so that the notice is searchable by state.

CONTRACT INFORMATION: 
The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in Minnesota requires the services of licensed land surveyors for the performance of legal boundary surveys for Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) and other conservation program easements.  This acquisition process is being conducted in accordance with the Brooks Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6 (Architect-Engineering Services). This procurement is solicited under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.10, exceeds the emerging small business threshold for architectural and engineering services, and is not set aside for small businesses.  The designated industry group for this acquisition is NAICS code 541370 [Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services], which has a size standard of $4.5 million.  This office intends to award eight (8) contracts as a result of this notice, one with a different vendor for each of the following geographic areas.  No vendor will be awarded more than one area, but vendors must specify the area number(s) for which they want to be considered.  For example, a vendor may submit for consideration for all areas 1 through 8, but only one contract for one area could be awarded to that contractor.  The type of contract to be awarded will be a requirements type task order contract as specified in FAR Part 16 and work will be ordered through the issuance of individual task orders on an as-needed basis (for surveys in the respective geographic areas) and in accordance with the resultant solicitation and contract (i.e. requirements, ordering limitations clauses, etc.) beginning approximately July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, for the base year, with the option on the part of the Government to renew for two (2) separate option periods of one year each. This announcement constitutes the only notice.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK: 
A list of surveys to be completed under this action is located in the attached statement of work.  The surveyor must be a licensed land surveyor in the State of Minnesota. The Surveyor will provide a boundary survey of the easement area which meets the requirements of the attached statement of work.  All projects shall be completed within 45 calendar days after issuance of a task order (to include the required pre-survey meeting through the post-survey meeting and submission of final survey deliverables to the NRCS office) unless the order states otherwise.  


SELECTION CRITERIA: 
Firms which meet the requirements described are invited to submit one original and three (3) copies of the attached Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications (completing both Part I and II).  Firms who have recently completed a SF 330, and have confirmed with the NRCS office that it is still on file, need not resubmit an SF 330.  However, should an offeror want to update the form a new one can be submitted and it will replace the one on file.

All firms responding to this announcement will be evaluated on the following factors which are shown in no order of importance and all are equally important. 

1. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services. 
The Surveyor must be a licensed registered land surveyor in the State of Minnesota. Evaluation will include the level of formal education, the number of years licensed, and involvement in professional activities/organizations.

2. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required
Evaluation will be based on knowledge of local survey practices, records research, experience in conducting rural or conservation easement boundary surveys, and the approach used on previous surveys to solve problems resulting from conflicting title or physical evidence.

3. Capacity to accomplish the work in the required performance time.
Evaluation will be based on ability to accomplish multiple work orders to completion within performance time stipulated in the statement of work and the ability to add personnel and/or consultants to complete work on time.  Due to the nature of the easement programs surveying work tends to be seasonal and multiple delivery orders can be issued in a short period of time.  The resultant solicitation and contract will stipulate limitations for the vendors’ obligation to perform and the governments’ obligation (maximum quantity) to order requirements for a given area.  Vendors should especially focus on articulating how requirements up to the limit will be fulfilled in the required time, as well as plans for addressing quantities of surveys over the maximum limit.  Evidence must be convincing and well articulated. 

4. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry.
Evaluation will be based on the firm’s past experience with other government agencies and the private section in performing the requirements described; cost control, quality, and timeliness of performance under previous contracts. References with name and telephone numbers must be provided.

5. Location in the general geographic area and knowledge of the locality of the project area
Evaluation will be based upon the firm’s location to the geographic area for each of the award areas for which they wish to be considered and knowledge of the locality of the project.  For firms outside the general project area(s), provide a plan to provide service in a cost effective manner. Firms must clearly indicate the office location where the work will be performed for each area..

6.  Demonstrated experience with similar types of projects in the State of Minnesota within the last five (5) years.  
Evaluation will be based on the firm’s experience in having conducted similar legal boundary surveys in the State of Minnesota within the last five (5) years. 

Use Section H of Part I of the SF 330 to provide relevant information regarding the above six (6) factors, if not adequately addressed in another section of the SF 330.

For each of the eight (8) planned awards, firms will be ranked from most to least qualified.  A request for proposal will be requested from the most qualified firm for each planned award and negotiations will be conducted to arrive at a fair and reasonable fee rate schedule that will be used to price individual task orders.  If a mutually acceptable price cannot be negotiated, negotiations will be terminated and the process will be repeated with the next highest ranked firm, and so on, and so forth, with the next if acceptable pricing cannot be negotiated. 

In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract. For information regarding registration contact the CCR Web Site at www.ccr.gov. It is also required that all contractors be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) to be considered for an award of a Federal Contract. For information regarding registration in ORCA, contact the ORCA web site at https://orca.bpn.gov. This is NOT a Request for Proposals but a Request for Qualifications. 


SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: 
All responsible firms that meet the requirements described herein, and wish to be considered, must submit an original and three copies of the complete package.  OFFEROR’S MUST INDICATE THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA(S) THEY WISH TO BE CONSIDERED.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible small business firms capable of performing Design-Bid-Build to construct a Consolidated Information Technology/Telecommunications Complex, location is Camp Lejeune (MCB), North Carolina. The purpose of this project is to construct a Consolidated Information Technology/Telecommunications Complex to include renovations and addition to existing 15,704 SF (bldg 24); construction of a 26,119 SF Communications Administrative Facility; a 18,691 SF Communication Services Facility; a 35,770 SF Base Telephone Facility; and a 13,595 Telephone Exchange Building. Renovation/addition work will require maintaining continuous (24 hr/day 7 day/week) operational capability of existing facilities. Operational capabilities include maintaining power and communications and personnel access and security. The construction is in an area highly congested with existing utilities and will require close supervision to avoid conflicts with existing utilities. Other work includes demolition of building 1104, 1105 and 1114 as pare part of this contract. These buildings are located in another area of the Base. This work will be phased to allow the personnel who are currently occupying the buildings to move into the new facilities. Extensive site work will be performed to accommodate the four facilities and the addition of a radio tower under a future project. All buildings, roads and parking will be designed to meet AT/FP and LEED requirements as described in this section. The project must be phased to allow staged construction of the buildings and parking to facilitate contractor lay down and Government personnel access to the site and existing facilities. The magnitude of construction range is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. 
All service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, certified HUBZone, small businesses, and certified 8(a) small businesses are encouraged to respond. Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Synopsis, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition in lieu of full and open competition is in the Government's best interest. This office anticipates award of a contract for this project no later than September 2010. The appropriate NAICS Code is 236220. 
THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential small business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of an award.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA: F34608-02-H-5003-0043. <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded a Cost Reimbursement Task Order to Humanitas, Inc., under the IDIQ Contract No. HHSH250200976001I, in the amount of $10,738.33. The period of performance is for three (3) months from the effective date of award.
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain services to plan, direct and execute a Field Objective Review entitled "(BHPr) Equipment to Enhance Training for Health Professionals (EETHP) - Centers of Excellence Program." These services include pre-review, review, and post review functions as well as close-out activities.</p>
<p>The Original IDIQ contract was competitively solicited as a 100% small business set-aside under FBO and was competitively awarded.</p>
<p>This procurement was awarded as a Cost Plus Award Fee type of Contract because the program office could not be sure of the actual number of grant applications that it would receive by the grant opportunity due date. Therefore, a firm commitment could not be made. It would not be possible to accurately estimate these costs with a reasonable degree of confidence given this unknown factor (actual number of grant applications), which also affects the number of panels that will be required to review the grants applications.</p>
<p>A Cost Plus Award Fee type of contract is appropriate for the required services and allows the Government to only pay for the review of the actual number of grant applications received and at the same time, provide the flexibility to have the appropriate number of panels.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) OF 2009.</p>

RECOVERY - The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded Task Order No. AG-7482-D-10-0014 to HDR, Inc. under Contract No. AG-3A75-C-09-0019.

The Contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described herein:

I. Purpose

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDA—Natural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard  The Contractor’s capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to verify that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall verify that the design:  

•	Addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies
•	Safely and effectively meets the stated objectives  
•	Addresses unique site conditions 
•	Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures
•	Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR UNDER CONTRACT NO. AG-3A75-C-09-0019.

RECOVERY - The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded Task Order No. AG-7482-D-10-0008.

The Contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described herein:

I. Purpose

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDA—Natural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard  The Contractor’s capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to verify that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall verify that the design:  

•	Addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies
•	Safely and effectively meets the stated objectives  
•	Addresses unique site conditions 
•	Is consistent with industry practice for similar structures
•	Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.

<DESC>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition <br />Under 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1)<br />Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements
<p>Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3, and in accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Agency and Contracting Activity.<br />Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard, Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Weeksville Rd., Elizabeth City, NC proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition.<br /><br />(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. <br />The US Coast Guard has a requirement on a sole source basis to acquire multi-function Electronic Flight Display Systems for use on US Coast Guard HC130-H aircraft including non-recurring engineering services for integration design, pre-production hardware, engineering support services and production hardware The proposed contractor is Innovative Solutions &amp; Support (IS&amp;S), 720 Pennsylvania Drive, Exton, PA 19341-1129, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The estimated Contract Value is $12,339,072.00<br /><br />(3) Description of Supplies/Services.<br />The US Coast Guard HC-130H aircraft supports a broad spectrum of US Coast Guard missions. Since the US Coast Guard has transferred to the Department of Homeland Security, US Coast Guard aircraft equipment requirements have increased to meet mission requirements associated with Homeland Security. These requirements call for the installation of common, interoperable and sustainable systems to the maximum extent possible.<br />To meet the Homeland Security strategic vision, the Coast Guard has developed the HC-130H Phase 1 Avionics Upgrade Operational Requirements Document (ORD), which calls for a multi-function Electronic Flight Display System (EFDS). That system must be fully compatible and inter-operable with the IS&amp;S Engine Instrument Display System (EIDS) that is currently on the aircraft. This EFDS is required to replace the out of production legacy flight instruments on the HC-130H that are no longer sustainable. IS&amp;S is the only manufacturer that can provide EFDS's that are fully compatible and inter-operable with their EIDS and provide non-recurring engineering services for system integration design necessary for system installation on the aircraft. <br />The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price Requirements type contract consisting of a Two (2) -year Base Period for purchase of Non-Recurring Engineering Services (NRE) for integration design development, purchase of pre-production activities hardware including hardware necessary for qualification testing and purchase of EFDS for one (1) Prototype aircraft installation and one (1) Validation aircraft installation; and three (3) One (1) -year Option Periods for purchase of Production EFDS units and Engineering Support Services.<br /><br />Period Term Value<br />Base Period 2-Yr $5,024,854.00<br />Option Period 1 1-Yr $2,576,224.00<br />Option Period 2 1-Yr $2,576,224.00<br />Option Period 3 1-Yr $2,161,770.00<br /><br />Total Contract Value $12,339,072.00<br /><br />An Electronic Flight Display System consists of the following components:<br />REDACTED<br />Description Qty Unit Total<br />10" Flat Panel Display,Data Concentrator Unit,&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic Chart/Map Server Unit, EGPWS,Display Control Panels (DCP),Supplementary DCP, Hand Controller Subsystem, Air Data Module (ADM),Installation Configuration Module ,Caution Warning Advisory Panel ,&nbsp;Engineering Test Kits ,Pre-production kits,Non-Recurring Engineering Hours,Spare EFDS Kits,&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineering Support Services Hours.</p>
<p>(4) Identification of the Justification and the Rationale.<br />The statutory authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />(5) Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority. <br />The HC-130H aircraft cockpit is currently undergoing an Engine Instrument Display upgrade where the current analog Engine Instrument display panels are being replaced with an IS&amp;S digital Engine Instrument Display System (EIDS) through a separate Coast Guard HC-130 avionics upgrade contract. The same Display Panels and associated hardware used in the EIDS can be used for the complete cockpit upgrade providing for commonality in the cockpit avionics architecture, maintenance flexibility and operational flexibility. Additionally, the aircraft cockpit instrument display panels are flight critical components. New displays, associated hardware and software must be fully compatible with the existing flight critical EIDS equipment and software. If the Coast Guard incorporated an Electronic Flight Display System that was not fully compatible with the IS&amp;S EIDS it would result in reduced flight safety, reduced operational availability, and reduced deployment capabilities.<br />The EIDS display units and associated hardware used in the EIDS are only manufactured by IS&amp;S. Based on market research no other manufacturer could be identified who produces hardware and software compatible with the existing EIDS equipment. Additionally, components that comprise the EIDS and EFDS are commercially available off- the-shelf items requiring minor modifications to software and materials necessary for installation on the aircraft. These modifications will not alter essential physical characteristics of the System, the System's components nor will it change the purpose of the integration process. Incorporation of common equipment from one (1) manufacturer allows critical maintenance and operational flexibility that would not be available if an EFDS from a different manufacturer were incorporated into the cockpit. Therefore IS&amp;S has unique qualifications that no other company has that will satisfy the U.S Coast Guard's EFDS requirement because:<br />(a) Commonality: Implementing a proven cockpit avionics architecture available for all C-130 aircraft variants, the CG has already installed two of the IS&amp;S displays and supporting architecture through a separate HC-130H upgrade contract. The subsystems and connections that support the two existing IS&amp;S displays employ a common architecture that enable growth to a total of six (6) displays while mitigating program costs associated with redundant weight, power demand, non-recurring engineering, program delays and integrated logistics support. <br />(b) Maintenance Flexibility: Common instrument display systems offer deployed maintenance personnel field options to perform troubleshooting or more importantly, to swap failed flight-critical instrument display panels with non-flight critical panels.<br />(c) Operational Flexibility: When encountering an in-flight failure of any one of the six (6) displays, aircrews are able to transfer vital flight or mission data to any other operating display or external display. All of the common displays can revert to a reversionary mode to provide an alternate display of desired data. <br />Additionally, IS&amp;S provides the engineering services critical for installation of the equipment on the aircraft. The non-recurring engineering effort includes engineering labor for the integration design, identification and execution of software and component modifications and various equipment qualification tests. Market research did not result in identification of another source who could perform these pre-production services for the IS&amp;S products.<br /><br />(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard issued Pre-solicitation Notice HSCG38-08-R-H00010 on March 18, 2008 on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site. No responses were received to the Notice. The formal solicitation document, Request for Proposal HSCG38-10-R-H00001 will also be advertised and posted to the FBO website and in accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii) all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency. A copy of the Pre-solicitation Notice issued under HSCG38-08-R-H00010 is included with this J&amp;A.<br /><br />(7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.<br />It is anticipated the cost to the Government for supplies and services will be determined fair and reasonable based on prices established in the Hanscom Air Force Base GATM Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract FA8730-06-D-0008 for same/similar services and similar hardware, software and components. Additionally, the contractor's proposal will be evaluated by an evaluation board comprised of USCG procurement and engineering personnel, USCG Program Office personnel and NAVAIR PMA 209 personnel using known historical data from similar programs where prices have been determined fair and reasonable. For award purposes the Government will evaluate the contractor's price proposal by adding the total price for all contract periods. <br /><br />(8) A description of the market research.<br />The US Coast Guard, Office of Aviation Acquisition (CG-931), Washington DC conducted market research to identify any other potential sources of Electronic Flight Display Systems (EFDS). The market research consisted of face to face meetings with all of the major manufacturers of EFDS. Due to software and hardware constraints, each manufacturer had proprietary Systems that were not fully compatible and inter-operable with the existing IS&amp;S EIDS on the HC-130H. As a result the market research did not find any companies, other than IS&amp;S, that could provide the Coast Guard with an EFDS that is fully compatible and inter-operable with the existing IS&amp;S EIDS. In this case fully compatible means you can remove any EFDS in the cockpit and place it into any other EFDS space, and still have full functionality. This is critical for operational and maintenance flexibility as described in paragraph 5.<br /><br />(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.<br />To further support the use of other than full and open competition, the US Coast Guard has identified additional reasons why IS&amp;S is the only responsible source and no other supply or services will satisfy the US Coast Guard's requirements.<br />&bull; Schedule Impact: If another vendor's EFDS were incorporated into the cockpit it would require an additional nine to twelve months of non-recurring engineering (NRE) to make the EFDS system function with the existing IS&amp;S EIDS. <br />&bull; Cost Impact: This effort would cost approximately $9.6M, which is based on a parametric cost estimate for the adaption/modification of 56,000 source lines of code (SLOC). <br />&bull; Performance Impact: By introducing a second vendor's EFDS's into the cockpit the maintenance crew of a deployed aircraft would lose the ability to replace a failed Display or Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) component with a Display or LRU component from the EIDS. This will result in the aircraft being unavailable for missions until a replacement EFDS Display unit or component could be acquired. In the case of aircraft that are deployed to remote locations shipping the part would take 2 to 3 days. <br />&bull; Performance Impact: There is a significant increase to flight safety by having a digital cockpit consisting on 6 displays (4 EFD's and 2 EIDS) that are all fully inter-operable. In the event of multiple display failures (due to lighting strikes, fire, other emergencies, etc) the most critical flight data can be moved to any of the remaining functional displays. If any vendor other than IS&amp;S provides the EFDs, we will lose a significant portion of that system redundancy because data could not be transferred between the EFD and the EIDS.<br /><br />(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.<br />The U S Coast Guard issued a Sources Sought Notice to seek potential sources that could satisfy the requirements of the HC-130H ORD. The following sources responded to the U.S. Coast Guard sources sought synopsis. <br />Lockheed Martin<br />L3, SPAR Aerospace Div (Canada)<br />ARINC Engineering Services<br />Boeing<br />M7 Aerospace<br />MTC Technologies<br />Rockwell Collins<br />NCG Navigation Systems Div<br />TKC Aero<br />NCG California Microwave Systems<br />Volaire<br />Raytheon Tech Services Co.<br />ILSC<br />Spirit Avionics<br />EPS<br />Astronautics<br />Westwind Technologies<br />Scientific Research<br />The US Coast Guard, Office of Aviation Acquisition (CG-931), Washington DC analyzed the individual system architectures of each interested source. As a result of this analysis, CG-931 determined that none of the sources met the requirement for an MFD system that is fully compatible and inter-operable with the IS&amp;S EIDS that currently exists in the HC-130H aircraft.<br /><br />(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for required supplies or services.<br />For reasons set forth in paragraph 5, the U.S. Coast Guard has no plan to compete future contracts for the supplies and service covered by this J&amp;A. Instead, the Coast Guard is recapitalizing the HC-130H avionics system and is following the configuration available to other DoD entities. As such, the Coast Guard plans to partner with DoD for future avionics system upgrades that will adhere to increasing commonality requirements. It is expected that future USCG/DoD joint fleet requirements will be evaluated for competitive procurements.</p>
