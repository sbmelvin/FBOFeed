<DESC><p>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the project "Coalition Shared Data (CSD) Services - Enduring Solution". The project will provide a NATO-owned capability utilizing Multi-Sensor Aerospace-Ground Joint Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Interoperability Coalition (MAJIIC) 4.4 / Baseline B.1 standards that will be interoperable with other NATO repositories as well as National CSD capabilities. This capability will replace the short-term bridging solution that is currently in place to support SHAPE, NATO Joint Force Commands, and required NATO Response Force Commands.</p>
<p>The CSD Services Enduring Solution project will be delivered to NATO locations (at a minimum: Mons, Belgium; Lago Patria, Italy; Sigonella, Italy) in support of NATO Command structure exercises and operations. The capability will acquire three software components, where each will provide a specific service as described in the Summary of Requirements, some of which may be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or modified COTS components.</p>
<p>The NCI Agency has compiled an Initial List of Bidders, which includes a number of U.S. companies. To access the list, download the Notification of Intent for this project from the following webpage: <a href="https://www.ncia.nato.int/Industry/Pages/Home.aspx">https://www.ncia.nato.int/Industry/Pages/Home.aspx</a>&nbsp;<br />All other potential U.S. prime contractors must be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government. Please see the section below entitled "Becoming Eligible to Bid" for more information.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) within the United States and 2) hold an active SECRET level facility security clearance. As execution of the proposed contract may require unescorted access and work of contractor personnel at NATO Class II security areas, contractor personnel will be required to hold personnel security clearances at the level of SECRET or higher. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Security Service issues the required NATO Security Clearance Certificates.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-14682-CSD, and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see the Notification of Intent for this project, which can be downloaded from the following webpage: <a href="https://www.ncia.nato.int/Industry/Pages/Home.aspx">https://www.ncia.nato.int/Industry/Pages/Home.aspx</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for U.S. NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 10 April 2018</p>
<p>- NCIA issues IFB (target): Q2 2018</p>
<p>- Bid Closing: Q2 2018</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): Q4 2018</p>

<ARCHDATE>04232018
<CONTACT>Cheryl Vendemia, Phone 3016196004, Email cheryl.r.vendemia.civ@mail.mil - Thomas L. Hood, Contracting Officer, Phone 3016199236, Email thomas.l.hood26.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Notice of Intent
<p>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source award (via modification) for continued research and development efforts for Naval Health Research Center's (NHRC's) NOR-211 clinical trial, in support of NHRC, 140 Sylvester Road, San Diego, CA 92152.</p>
<p>These services are currently being provided under a non-severable contract/task order W911QY-11-D-0053/0015, awarded to the Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine (HJF). Due to unforeseen delays in the project, primarily due to delays in the Government IRB approvals and the recent absence of Norovirus outbreaks in the Great Lakes area, in order to complete the clinical trial and for the Government to obtain a benefit from the services provided, additional time and effort is required to complete the project. It is estimated that an additional six-months of services provided by HJF will result in completion of the clinical trial.</p>
<p>The IRB-reviewed and approved clinical vaccine trail protocol designated NOR-211 is a Phase IIb, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Double-blind, Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Intramuscular Norovirus GI.1/GII.4 Bivalent Virus-Like Particle Vaccine in Healthy Adults. The modification to the existing non-severable services contract/task order will extend the period of performance by six months, from 30 April 2018 to 30 October 2018, with an estimated increase of $1.3M, in order to gain and compile research data to successfully complete the clinical trial.</p>
<p>The purpose of the NOR-211 study is to demonstrate the efficacy and expand data on the safety and immunogenicity profile of this new, investigational Norovirus (NoV) vaccine, evaluate the immune response to the NoV vaccine when given with other vaccines, as well as the potential effects the NoV vaccine has on the immune response to the other vaccines received at the same time and vice/versa. The NOR-211 study will help prepare for a future Phase III study where the vaccine will be used to assess whether it can prevent NoV illness in U.S. Navy Recruit Training settings. Study subjects include consenting voluntary Navy recruits entering basic training at Naval Station Great Lakes, IL.</p>
<p>Based on the progression of the research thus far, the proposed modification to increase performance for six months will allow for research efforts to include additional study participants in order to carry out the study protocols to successfully evaluate the immune response to the NoV vaccine when given with other vaccines, the potential effects the NoV vaccine on the immune response, and to the other vaccines received at the same time. Without the additional work and extended period of performance, an adequate study sample cannot be achieved. In addition, as a result of the lack of norovirus cases, an increased number of research subjects were enrolled in the study later than anticipated, requiring additional time to complete patient safety follow-ups, in compliance with FDA study regulations. Without the additional time and effort, patient safety follow-ups would not be completed. In addition, without the additional time and effort, it would not be possible to provide patient safety follow-ups for the most recent/to be enrolled subjects, gather the data, and prepare it for evaluation.</p>
<p>The contractor will continue to provide research support for the NOR-211 clinical trial. In coordination with the NHRC Principal Investigator, the contractor will continue to carry out the NOR-211 clinical study in accordance with the IRB-approved protocol. The contractor will provide personnel with the research expertise and familiarity with this ongoing clinical trial. The personnel will provide the overall day-to-day management and conduct of the NOR-211 protocol elements to ensure successful completion of the objectives and outcomes set forth in the protocol, ensuring adherence to quality standards and good clinical practices. Aspects of service consist of, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>&bull; assist with coordinating assigned research studies in accordance with approved protocol and applicable local and state and federal regulations while promoting the safety and confidentiality of research subjects and their data at all times,<br />&bull; meet with potential research subjects; explain the research project in detail and determine if subject meets study eligibility based on the protocol's delineated inclusion and exclusion criteria,<br />&bull; enroll eligible subjects into the study by obtaining a fully completed signed/written informed consent document,<br />&bull; perform blood draw processing and blood and serum processing according to federal and state regulations,<br />&bull; administer all study-related vaccinations using good clinical practices,<br />&bull; complete all appropriate study-related document(s) to ensure correct vaccines (investigational vaccine or placebo) were administered to each study subject,<br />&bull; conduct and document investigational vaccine and placebo inventories, <br />&bull; ensure study materials and equipment are available to perform daily study functions,<br />&bull; maintain complete and accurate drug and equipment accountability,<br />&bull; ensure analysis and recorded test data reports form a consistent narrative, <br />&bull; provide administrative support for the management of generated research data as necessary,<br />&bull; ensure proper closure of each research subject,<br />&bull; coordinate shipping of specimens from study sites, and<br />&bull; ensure all regulatory and protocol requirements are met, including patient-safety follow-ups.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the entire task order, inclusive of performance during this six month extension, is expected to be 2 Dec 2015 to 30 October 2018.</p>
<p>If capable sources are not identified through this notice, NMLC intends to award a sole source modification under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine (HJF), 6720-A Rockledge Drive, Suite 100, Bethesda, MD 20817.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 1 (8.5 x 11 inch) page using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 9:00AM Local Time, 9 April 2018. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: cheryl.r.vendemia.civ@mail.mil AND thomas.l.hood26.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: Subatmospheric Gas Delivery Source (SAGS) Diborane Cylinder
<SOLNBR>SB1341-18-RQ-0298
<RESPDATE>040618
<CONTACT>Tracy M Bisson, Phone 3019758448, Email tracy.bisson@nist.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Entegris, Inc.; 117 Jonathan Blvd, Chaska, MN 55318 for the purchase of a Subatmospheric Gas Delivery Source (SAGS) Diborane Cylinder for NIST's Engineering Physics Division (EPD).The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>The NIST EMD provides leadership in conducting research in the areas of dimensional, nanometer-scale, surface, and acoustic pressure metrology; accelerometry; silicon Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology; Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS); power electronics; nano electronics; and flexible/printed electronics. In support of this mission, the Atom-Based Metrology in Surface &amp; Nanostructure Metrology Group of implementing the capability for boron doping of Si (100) surfaces with atomic scale control using a new low temperature (LT) UHV STM.  For this purpose, an ultra-high purity diborane (B2H6) gas delivery system with AES safety cabinet and a fully automated purge panel is going to be installed.  While the safety cabinet is designed for a specific cylinder configuration, SAGS B2H6, the cylinder that contains the gas to be dosed is not included with the cabinet.</p>
<p>Entegris, Inc is the sole source Contractor for this product.  The reason is the dangerous nature of the gases used by the system (toxicity and flammability), extreme care has been taken to design the gas cabinet and delivery system to work with specialized cylinders that will supply the gases (phosphine, and diborane) in the safest manner possible.  In particular, NIST's owned UHV STM system is designed to work only with a VAC cylinder of diborane - this is a gas cylinder that is able to supply gas at sub-atmospheric pressure.  This is achieved by the use of a highly reliable two-stage sub-atmospheric regulator that is internal to the cylinder.  Diborane cylinders of this kind that meet all of our requirements are unique to Entegris. In addition, the tool needs to be compatible with existing atom based device and experimental setups are already by NIST that were previously purchased from Scienta Omicron. If the tool is not compatible with this existing equipment it would require the purchase of a new system and thus result in a duplication of Government costs. Compatibility is also needed to allow for exchangeability with NIST's collaborators to allow for continuity of research. Entegris is the only manufacturer and distributor of the required SAGS Diborane Cylinder in the world.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 326199 and the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. Eastern on April 6, 2018.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to tracy.bisson@nist.gov .  No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>General Information<br />Short Title: Procurement of the Formulatrix MANTIS Liquid handling device <br />Document Type: Presolicitation Notice<br />Solicitation Number: N02CO82544 - 36 <br />Posted Date: 3/23/2018<br />Response Date: 4/2/2018<br />Classification Code: 66 - Instruments and laboratory equipment<br />NAICS Code: 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing
<p>Contracting Office Address</p>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E122 Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The MANTIS is an easy to program, low volume, low dead-volume, non-contact reagent dispenser. The Mantis can be configured with up to 24 different reagents, has a dispense range of 100 nl - 2 ml, can dispense any volume into any well, and is compatible with any plate density up to 1536. To minimize dead volume, reagents can plug directly into microfluidic chips. Dead volumes can be further reduced to 6 &mu;l by using pipette tips as reagent reservoirs. This feature is ideal for dispensing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) sample prep reagents.</p>
<p>NCI's goal is to pair this dispensing device with its government-owned Agilent Bravo liquid handler system in their workflow for NGS library preparations, specifically using Agilent SureSelect Strand Specific RNA library kits. With the high cost of sequencing reagents and the call for reproducible data in translation genomics research, the Mantis, microfluidic handler, will provide a solution for automation of sequencing experiments with a balance between value and cost. In addition to the NGS application, Mantis can be used for cell-dispensing in cell-based assays, automation and miniaturization of immunoassays, as well as PCR/qPCR assays. This dispenser has a small footprint and will be accommodated within core space.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial items. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract with the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (MOD), Whitehall, London,&nbsp;United Kingdom&nbsp;for the procurement of one (1) C-130J under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Government requires a suitable replacement aircraft, which must be delivered in an expeditious manner, to avoid a gap in logistical support of the Blue Angels flight demonstration squadron. The aircraft being procured from the UK MOD has the requisite amount of life and technical capability to support the Blue Angels mission. Procurement of a comparable replacement C-130J from any source other than the UK MOD would create an unacceptable increase in program cost and delay in fielding this critical capability. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement. The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No phone inquiries will be entertained. Reponses shall be made in writing by email or U.S. mail to the attention of Ms. Lisa Ambrose using the contact information provided in this synopsis.
<p>Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available. Request for the same will be disregarded.</p>

<DESC>PHEROMONE CONCENTRATION IN RIVER WATER
The U.S. Geological Survey, the Hammond Bay Biological Station has a requirement for 7, 12, 24-trihydroxy-3-one-5-cholan-24-sulfate (3kPZS) and 5-dueterated 3kPZS (5d3kPZS) be determined from 550 extracted river water samples. The U.S. Geological Survey intends to make a non-competitive purchase order to Michigan State University, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Dr. Weiming Li Lab to quantify sea lamprey pheromones from stream water.

There are no option periods.
The proposed contractor developed the method to measure sea lamprey pheromone in stream waters and published the method that should be used (see below).  The sea lamprey pheromone is only useful for controlling sea lamprey in the Great Lakes and therefore no other lab has the very expensive machinery required and has developed approaches to measure sea lamprey pheromones in stream water. 
In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency, however, THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).

Email responses to hnair@usgs.gov.  Emailed responses are preferred.

The NAICS code is 541380.  The size standard is $15.00 million.

The anticipated award date of the contract is 01/25/2013.  The anticipated contract will be firm fixed-price.  A vendor must be registered at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ to be awarded the contract.

The information collected will be used for market research to define the government's requirements and create the appropriate acquisition strategy. Responding to this notice does not automatically include the responder on any bidders list, if such a list is developed. Depending on the quantity and quality of the responses received, the criteria may serve to generate the initial pool of potential contractors to be invited to respond to a resulting solicitation.
<p>NAL requires electronic access via the Internet to selected Springer electronic journals, backfiles, ebooks and other publications for use by all USDA employees, contractors, authorized public on-site users, cooperators and volunteers working on behalf of USDA and acting within the scope of their relationship with USDA.</p>
<p>All USDA locations worldwide are to be considered authorized premises. USDA employees and contractors, cooperators and volunteers working on behalf of USDA and acting within the scope of their relationship with USDA, as well as employees, contractors, cooperators and volunteers working on behalf of other federal agencies that are authorized by the publisher to use NAL's DigiTop service, are considered authorized users of the journals.

<p>The contractor shall make the Springer Nature publications accessible 24 hours per day. Authorized users shall be granted access to the Springer nature journals through the IP authentication without any impediments.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide access to the Springer Nature publications in accordance with the following terms and conditions:</p>

<p>b. The contractor shall grant post-cancellation access and perpetual data rights to the subscribed-to content upon subscription to the full volume year for each title. When the July 1 renewal is processed, perpetual access rights will convey for all titles for which access was previously purchased.</p>
<p>i. If the full volume year of any given title is not purchased by USDA, that title will have no perpetual access rights.</p>
<p>ii. For any title not selected for renewal, USDA retains the option to purchase the remainder of the volume year by paying the remaining balance due for the normal 12-month subscription. Perpetual access rights will be conveyed for these titles.</p>
<p>iii. If a title is no longer available from Springer Nature for the next full year, USDA will have the option to purchase the remainder of that title's volume year, so that perpetual access is acquired.</p>
<p>c. Upon request by NAL the contractor shall provide the subscribed-to or <br />purchased content in the mutually agreed-upon electronic medium and format.</p>
<p>d. The right to perpetual use of the subscribed-to journal content will survive <br />the termination of the contract for any reason.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide access to the subscribed content and the administrative interface without imposing on the subscriber's users any additional terms and conditions or similar restrictions that are not part of the contract. If the contractor's system's technical functionality prevents suppression of such terms and conditions or similar restrictions, the contractor agrees that any language, however construed and presented, is null and void and not binding on the subscriber's users.</p>
<p>All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database as required by FAR 4.1102 to be considered for any awards. See FAR 52.204-7 for registration instructions. It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor FBO for any amendments.</p>
