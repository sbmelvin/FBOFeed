HU25 FULL FACE QUICK DONNING OXYGEN MASK PART NUMBER (P/N) MF10-03-02 REPAIR/OVERHAUL
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
22 JUNE 05

1.	BACKGROUND
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  EROS Full Face Quick Donning Oxygen Masks, P/N MF10-03-02, manufactured by GIE-EROS, Plaisir, France, were installed in these aircraft in 1991 and are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking also provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, and item location.  

2.	OBJECTIVE
2.1	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or an FAA authorized repair center to effectively repair and overhaul (as defined in paragraph 2) and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 oxygen masks.  Repaired/overhauled oxygen masks must meet the OEM’s specifications In Accordance With (IAW) Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) 35-13-61, REV 2, dated 01/31/2003 and Coast Guard Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) HU-25 935030.0 dated 08/01/1992.  The Coast Guard has placed all oxygen mask parts, with the exception of Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC 1007-4, on condition and will be replaced as necessary.  The Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC 1007-4, requires overhaul every six (6) years. 

The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair.  First, a “return to service” is considered as test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement (i.e., Harness Assy., Microphone Assy., Hose Supply Assy., and Mask Assy.) if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements (component time continues). Secondly, an overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes overhaul of the regulator assembly and the replacement of additional parts as necessary. An overhaul zeroes the Time Since Overhaul (TSO). 

The Contractor shall install Dust Cover P/N 59447-00 to Hose Assembly P/N DTS series for both repair and overhaul.  

The Contractor shall provide a cost breakdown for parts and labor. At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the offeror’s technical and cost proposal.  Offerors may propose additional levels of service.

The Contractor is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul oxygen masks.
The Contractor responsibilities to the Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins and Coast Guard TCTOs remain incorporated upon completion of work. 

3.	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ARE APPLICABLE:

3.1	OEM Component Maintenance manual: 
CMM 35-13-61, REV 2, dated 01/31/2003

3.2	CG Technical Orders:
3.2.1	CG TCTO HU-25 935030.0 dated 08/01/1992
3.3	Data Availability:
3.3.1	OEM manuals, Service Bulletins and specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by the Coast Guard.
3.3.2	Coast Guard specific CGTOs, can be acquired through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Submit a written request to:

Commanding Officer
Attn:  ARSC FOIA Officer
United States Coast Guard
Aircraft Repair & Supply Center
Elizabeth City, NC 27909

4.	SERVICE BULLETINS
All OEM SBs previously incorporated shall remain incorporated. SBs which upgrade the component or improve reliability shall be incorporated upon approval of CG’s Contracting Officer.

This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immediatel y to support Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs. Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative sources. Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in questi on, we might be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, reconditioned items or in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by suppliers as surplus equipment. Depending upon respondents capabilities and t he current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment / repair/overhaul. Alternatively, we might want to buy the unserviceable assets and induct these into ongoing organic repair program s that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field.  Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY significant quantity of Army avionics is encouraged to respond with infor mation regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request. Companies capable of performing this effort may respond by writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N- AN (MICHAEL E. HARRIS), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil. This synopsis is for informational purposes only and not an offer for proposal.

<DESC>This synopsis was previously posted with the incorrect RFQ number (N00033-05-Q-9018).  This posting corrects the RFQ number (N00033-06-Q-9018).  

The T-AO 187 Class Fleet Oilers, Henry J. Kaiser Class were built in three (3) flights, with the first vessel delivered in the December 1985 and the last of this class in the November 1995.  The final 3 vessels were delivered with double hull construction.  These vessels were built to ABS Rules and are compliant with commercial Rules and Regulations.  The T-AO vessels are referred to as a Fleet Oilers, but their mission is to support vessels at sea with fuel, food and other staples.  These are transferred while each vessel is underway by a number of means.  The transfers are done between the Fleet Oilers and up to two vessels side-by-side while underway.  The Fleet Oilers provide a unique mission support to the Navies of the world.

MSC has upgraded the bridge and navigation systems with new systems and components throughout the years to maintain our compliance with the Rules and Regulations and take advantage of technology to help our mariners.  These upgrades were done through MSC’s alteration process as single system installations and were therefore not integrated with existing systems or capable of utilizing their design capabilities.  Furthermore, the installations were not uniform among the vessels or area commands.  In many cases the systems are not from the same makers.  
MSC intends to upgrade the entire bridge, which will require the removal of some systems, relocation of others, and installation of new or up to date systems.  It is intended to have a contractor develop pre-solicitation information on a number of T-AO 187 Class vessels to facilitate a comprehensive design to achieve an approved ergonomic bridge design.  Prior to the commencement of the design effort, MSC desires to capture what is presently on the T-AO 187 Class Vessels and an overview of how the new system shall be integrated.

<DESC>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) has a continuing requirement for a Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU).  Beginning in September 1999, the NCI created via contract the CTSU; the intent was to facilitate access by investigators to a broader menu of clinical trials led by Cooperative Groups or other investigators and to centralize and make more efficient a number of administrative tasks common to all the Cooperative Group Operations and Statistical/Data Management Centers.  The CTSU has, in fact, facilitated the conduct of trials by allowing a participating physician to perform registration and data management of patients on the trials of all Groups irrespective of the Group in which he/she is a member.  To further facilitate these cross-Group enrollments, the CTSU developed auditing, financial payment, and education/training systems that complement and interdigitate with the existing Cooperative Group systems.  In addition to Group members, the CTSU has also provided a mechanism for unaffiliated sites to participate in trials on the CTSU menu.

The CTSU systems are primarily web-based (www.ctsu.org) and there is a public and private website.  Only registered investigators have access to the private site where they can access materials and tools for enrolling patients on clinical trials. Presently the CTSU menu of over 60 trials consists primarily of phase 3 treatment trials in breast, lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, head and neck, hematologic and other less common tumors.  In addition, a more limited menu of phase 2 multi-center treatment trials is also available.  Investigators who are members of a Cooperative Group automatically have access to all CTSU trials, and some sites unaffiliated with Groups, have also been granted access, after undergoing a credentialing and review process conducted by the CTSU.

The purpose of this acquisition is to build upon the progress made over the last 6 years and expand the CTSU’s primary tasks, which include:  1) Operation of the CTSU comprehensive system for clinical trials management with state-of-the-art, web-based, registration, randomization and data collection/query systems; 2) Operation of the CTSU Regulatory Support System (RSS) to consolidate IRB approvals along with site and investigator credentialing for all Adult Group trials, phases 1-3; 3) Operation of the CTSU web site for accessing protocols, forms, and education/training materials; 4) Conduct education and training (generic and study-specific) for the CTSU systems and its menu of protocols; 5) Operation of the CTSU quality assurance system, including on-site auditing and real-time monitoring of data collection delinquencies and errors; 6) Operation of the CTSU financial management system for distribution of per case payments, leadership funds, investigator travel and technical expertise reimbursements; and 7) Operation of the CICRS (Clinical Independent Cancer Research Sites) program to permit unaffiliated sites to join the CTSU.

This is a recompetition of a previous requirement and the Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a base period of three years with the opportunity for the contractor to earn up to four additional contract years (Award Terms).  RFP No. N02-CM-67001-48 will be issued on or about January 9, 2006.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Office of Acquisitions (OA), NCI, at the following url:  http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/ .  The NAICS Code is 541690.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  No Collect Calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This project involves operation and maintenance of rock-block monitoring equipment installed on the Mount Rushmore sculpture.  The intention in advertisement is to award a base-year contract with the option to renew the period of service for four additional years.  A total of five years. This work includes the review and interpretation of electronically produced and collected data to determine if: 1) all components are operating properly, and 2) interpreting block movement.  This data is collected from 36 transducers and documented in report form semi-annually and made available to the National Park Service (NPS).  The analysis of the data will be provided to the designated Contracting Officers Representative (COR) for this project.  Sampling will be performed often enough to determine if the readings change significantly, as specified in the contract. The Contractor will perform the repair and maintenance of the data collection system in its entirety.  It is expected that some of the required maintenance functions will include gauge retrieval from the Sculpture, gauge calibration and reinstallation, instrument inspection and equipment replacement.  At a minimum, 25% of the transducers will be recalibrated annually.  Each instrument will be checked annually for alignment and tightness of fasteners.  Cables, connections, and protective enclosures will also be inspected annually and repaired/replaced as required.  This is a firm, fixed-price contract for a period of one year, with four, one year renewable options. Contract renewal options will depend on successful performance and availability of funding. This contract will be an Evaluated Procurement.  Proposals will be evaluated based on best value to the government.   Evaluation factors are past performance, technical expertise, key personnel and cost.  All evaluation factors other than price or cost, when combined, are significantly more important than price or cost.  Past performance factors will be evaluated on the proposed project team's recent experience in performing similar type work, references from the past five years will be required.  Technical expertise factors will be evaluated on the proposed project team's knowledge and experience in rock block monitoring systems similar to the one installed at Mount Rushmore NM, including monitoring and maintaining installed equipment; gathering and interpreting data; understaning of computer hardware and software in procesing the data.  Other technical factors are the team's certifcation in industrial rope access/rappelling and ability to work independently without supervison by NPS staff.  Key personnel factors will be evaluated on the proposed project team's education and qualifications related to geotechnical and rock mechanics as they apply to granite formations, as well as the aforementioned rock climbing abilities.  (40% past performance/30% technical expertise/20% key personnel/10% price or cost/100 points possible).  Proposals must be submitted on government provided forms only.  This project is subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965.  The magnitude of this project over five years is between $250,000 and $500,000.  NAICS: 541690, P&S: B519.  This solicitation will be available ONLY on the Department of Interior (DOI) website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  Bid package will be available O/A 12/29/2005 and will close 01/27/2006 at 02:00 pm MST., unless extensions are issues in an amendment.  NO PAPER COPIES WILL BE MAILED.

<DESC>STORM DAMAGE TIMBER/WOOD CHIPPING SALVAGE SALE at the Naval Support Activity Crane, Indiana will be sold to the highest bidder.    This sale includes cutting and harvesting all usable trees within a designated area as specified in the solicitation documents. In the interest of post harvest cleanup safety a method of on-site whole-tree-chipping will be employed, with the extraction of saw logs being the only exception.  This sale consists of a minimum of 17.9 acres of damaged forestland indicated by marked boundary. An estimate of 5,948 board feet per acre is present (Hobson, 1999), thus yielding 106,469.2 total board feet (Doyle Scale) present.  A 15% reduction in volume will be assessed due to damage, thus resulting in an estimated volume of 90,498.82 board feet to be removed.  An estimate of 60% of the volume is in the form of pulpwood to be chipped and the remaining is designated as saw log volume.  An estimate of 8 tons per 1000 board feet, or 125 board feet per ton, will be used to assess the price per ton.  Each load of material, both SAWLOGS and CHIPS will be weighed at scales located on center and recorded to assess payment owed.  Upon mutual agreement between contractor and contracting officer, additional volumes of saw logs and/or chips outside of the original 17.9 acres can be added.  The Government may designate these additional volumes by marked boundary or by using paint to mark additional saw logs.  Additional volume will be bought at the original corresponding contract price.  Release date is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, December 14, 2005 with a bid opening tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, January 4, 2006. THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE RELEASED VIA THE INTERNET.

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION: Contract Services for aircraft to aerially apply seed to approximately 37,160 acres of post-burn acreage in Lincoln County, Nevada on the Southern Nevada Fire Complex and transport of approximately 260,000 pounds of seed from the BLM warehouse in Las Vegas, Nevada to treatment/treatment staging area(s).  Contractors may bid on one or all line items.  All or part of the Contract may be awarded. The rough locations of the treatment areas are shown on the attached maps.  Specifically, the treatments will be concentrated within the perimeters of the Delamar, Meadow Valley, Duzak, Halfway and East Mormon Fires.  Please note that the polygons/treatment areas identified on the maps represent an area greater than the total 37,160 acres to be seeded.  Exact seeding polygons and treatment area acreages will be provided at the pre-work conference.  Final polygons will also include approximately 25 to 30 ten-acre exclusion zones within the areas to be seeded.  These will serve as control plots for monitoring treatment effectiveness. Road access to the project areas is extremely limited.  Sites may lack suitable landing strips/areas and poor road conditions should be anticipated.  Additionally, limitations on access posed by critical and non-critical desert tortoise habitat and the Meadow Valley Wash Stabilization and Restoration Project may present challenges to the completion of the work required by the solicitation.  The seeding must be completed within the desert tortoise inactive period which occurs between November 1 and February 28/29.  The anticipated start date for this project is between January 3rd and January 10th, 2006, and work must be completed by February 28, 2006. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Aerial Seeding: Contractor shall provide materials (excepting seed which will be provided by the BLM), supplies, labor/personnel and equipment to aerially seed five burned areas totaling approximately 37,160 acres.  The burned areas to be seeded are in Lincoln County, Nevada.  The terrain is variable with limited vehicle access.  Approximately 260,000 pounds of seed are to be aerially applied to the five different treatment areas.  Three different seeding mixes will be used, and application rates for the different mixes range from 6.3 to 13.3 pounds per acre.    The five treatment areas are located within approximately a 22 mile radius of each other.   Each treatment area contains multiple seeding polygons varying in size from approximately 40 acres to approximately 5,500 acres.   Additionally, within the seeding polygons there will be 25 to 30 ten-acre control plots which will not be seeded. Site locations are shown on Individual Treatment Area Project Maps and the General Work Location Map.  Detailed maps and digital files in ARC/INFO GIS format shape files will be provided at the pre-work conference.  The aerial seeding project shall be completed within 30-45 days, depending on aircraft used and weather permitting.  Work must be completed no later than Feb. 28, 2006, due to desert tortoise conservation requirements.   Work on these projects shall comply with all Federal, State and local regulations. Seed Transportation: Contractor shall provide materials, supplies, labor/personnel, and equipment to transport 260,000 lbs of seed from the BLM warehouse in Las Vegas, NV to treatment/treatment staging areas.  Seed is in 50 lb bags.  Recommendations for possible staging areas have been made on Project Maps.  Actual determinations of suitable staging/landing areas are the responsibility of the Contractor.  Sites must be submitted to the Government at the pre-work conference for clearance/approval.   The Contractor will be responsible for providing all equipment, materials (except seed), supplies, labor, loading, transportation and logistic planning to complete the project as described.  Coordination with local governments, airports and city/county personnel, if required, will be the responsibility of the Contractor and should be included in the bid price. The nearest towns to the project area with motels are Alamo, Caliente, Glendale and Mesquite.  Services for aircraft are limited, and the Contractor will need to locate the nearest fuel sources.  Possible locations for AVGAS are Mesquite and Cedar City.

This announcement constitutes the only RFQ; quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  This procurement is made on the basis of full and open competition.  The identifying number is RFQ- OH-06-00042.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-06.  The NAICS code is 541620 and the size  standard is $6 million.  A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  Therefore, offerors are requested to submit a firm fixed price quote for each phase of the statement of work below.  This procurement is for the project, "Development of an Ohio MARKAL  Database" required by the Office of Research and Development located in Research Triangle Park, NC in accordance with the statement of work. Statement of Work I.  Title Development of an Ohio MARKAL database II. Background The U.S. EPA is interested in the development of regional energy models to  support state air quality managers in analyzing technological options for improving air quality. Over the  past several years EPA's Office or Research and Development has successfully supported the development of New England MARKAL (NE-MARKAL), a state-specific database for use in the MARKAL  (MARket ALlocation) model.  The database provides technology and demand data for the energy systems of each state from 1999 to 2029 in three year increments. ORD is now interested in expanding state-specific coverage to the Midwest.  As a first step in garnering interest for development of an  MW-MARKAL, ORD is seeking to develop an Ohio energy system database for use in MARKAL, and through its development and use to begin the process of engaging other Midwest regional stakeholders towards the potential of a full MW-MARKAL compatible with NE-MARKAL.  If the development and testing of the  Ohio database is successful (including compatibility with NE-MARKAL) as additional EPA funding permits, additional Midwest states may be added through a similar procedure as below. III. Scope of work Phase I: The following tasks shall be performed. Task 1.  Establishment of Small Steering Group The  Contractor shall establish a small steering group of stakeholders representing Ohio energy and environmental players including, as appropriate, governmental agencies to provide guidance for data sources for Ohio-specific information and review of Ohio-MARKAL model assumptions. Task 1 shall be  implemented within 1 month after award. Task 2.  Preparation and Submittal of QAPP The contractor shall prepare and submit a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  The project will not proceed without an EPA approved QAPP.  The contractor shall prepare and adhere to the QAPP as it applies to the  analysis of secondary data as defined in Attachment 1 to the statement of work.  Task 2 shall be completed within 2 months of award.   Task 3.  Assemble Data Using sources identified in Task 1 as well as regional and state data from the Energy Information Administration, the Department of  Transportation, EPA's national MARKAL database, and other publicly available sources, the Contractor shall assemble appropriate data to represent Ohio for the following energy sectors: electricity generation; agriculture; commercial; industrial; residential; and transportation sectors.  Task 3  shall be completed within 10 months after award.   Task 4.  Develop Templates The Contractor shall develop templates containing the demand, technology, and air emission data needed for the sectors defined in Task 3.  The template shall be an Excel workbook of data including raw data, source of  data, data transformation processes, and final MARKAL ready data for upload through the ANSWER interface.  Each sector is to be a separate workbook. Task 4 shall be completed within 10 months after award.   Task 5.  Develop Reference Energy System (RES) Representation The Contractor shall develop  in MARKAL the appropriate reference energy system (RES) representation to support the Ohio-specific data contained in the templates of Task 4. Task 5 shall be completed within 10 months after the award.   Task 6.  Calibrate Ohio Database in MARKAL The Contractor shall calibrate the Ohio database by  testing in MARKAL and comparing the results to match the Ohio energy balance for 1999 and the 1999 emission profile for the state.  These preliminary results shall be reviewed by the Steering group assembled in Task 1 and refinements recommended by the group to improve calibration shall be  implemented. Task 6 shall be completed within 11.5 months after the award.   Task 7.  Delivery of Templates The Contractor shall deliver the final templates, the sector data, and the Ohio RES structure twelve months after initiation of the contract.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) concerning potential weapons capabilities for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to perform studies and analyses on existing and future weapons capable of being deployed from current and future UAS platforms to perform required missions.   THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.     

The Air Force is working to develop a weapons portfolio capable of being deployed by various classes of UAS’s.  UAS’s types can range from small UAS’s to major UAS’s in accordance with the 2005 OSD UAS Roadmap. UAS’s tactical roles and missions on the battlefield are increasing. The ability to engage and prosecute various tactical targets on the battlefield by UAS’s is expanding.  The Air Armament Center, Capabilities Integration Directorate, Technology Transition and Concept Development Division, is seeking information to investigate current and future weapon capability applicable to UAS’s.  
The information submitted should include these general characteristics of a UAS capable weapon:
-- The weapon should be of an air to ground configuration. The weapon should be capable of being deployed at 30,000 MSL or below with a weapons release velocity of less than or equal to 200 knots. 
--The total weight of the weapon should be less than 100 pounds.  
--The weapon should be precision guided capable of supporting complex terrain/
urban CAS, SEAD, Interdiction, and CSAR mission roles, having anti-personnel, anti-vehicle, area attack, anti-littoral warhead capabilities.  

--A common weapon to aircraft interface (1760 mil stnd ) capability is required 
where applicable.

--A Bomb Rack and/or Launch Rail capability for integrating a 
weapon onto existing and future UAS’s.

Some additional weapon considerations should be given to the option for
Cooperative Control of Engagement via integration into the Global Information
Grid (GIG).

Particular attention needs to be devoted to the integration of the weapon system
into existing UAS platforms (current and future development aircraft).

In addition to information requested above, please provide information on small
UAS’s with miniature weapons capable of low yield explosive, low weight, and
the appropriate weapon to aircraft interfaces.

Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to provide relevant examples of ongoing and previous contractual efforts with the Government that support the desired capabilities described. Respondents may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. Respondents are encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately.     AAC/XR uses service contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements to include review of these capabilities submittals.  Service contracts contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires the service contractors to protect the data and prohibits the service contractors from using the data for any purpose other than that for which the data was presented.     This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, as well as subject to modification, and is in no way binding on the Government. Please use subject heading: Weapons for Unmanned Aircraft System’s Applications in electronic responses.     Responses must be received no later than 3 PM CDT on 20 January 2006. For technical questions, please contact Mr. Ron Johnson at 850-883-3229 or by email at ron.johnson@eglin.af.mil.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research,  Development, and Engineering Center (TACOM-Picatinny) Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  has a requirement for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) of the Spider Network  Command Munition system to include fabrication, test and delivery of a  quantity of 9-14 each  XM-7 Spider systems over a  thirty (30) month period of  time. The XM-7 Spider system will meet the President's Anti -Personnel Landmine (APL)  policy and schedule with regards to Non-Self-Destruct/Self -Destruct APL. The U.S. Army intends to satisfy this requirement for the above systems through  a sole source contract with the non-entity joint venture team of Textron  Systems, Wilmington, MA and Alliant Techsystems, Plymouth, MN, who is the  current contractor of the XM-7 Spider system.  They have the necessary  equipment and skills to produce these systems to meet the delivery schedule  requirements. The XM-7 Spider system is built to a performance specification,  the Government does not have a mature Technical Data Package, and some of the  electronics in the munition payload are proprietary to the joint venture  companies. This action is based on other than full and open competition procedures  utilizing the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302- 1(a)(2)(ii).

<DESC>The Program Manager for Heavy Tactical Vehicles proposes to negotiate a new firm, fixed price contract with Oshkosh Truck Corporation to engineer, integrate and install armor kits for test as part of the PEO CS&CSS Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS).  T his requirement supports needed improvements to the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) to install an integrated flexible armor solution in new production vehicles.  The LTAS armor is considered a component of the next configuration HEMTT. A need exists for long range improvements in the design of armor protection of tactical wheeled vehicles used to supply and support advancing troops serving in the role of occupying forces during wartime and in civil disaster environments. This effort will result in completion of production designs that will allow for application of armor protection to vehicles on the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) production lines and to the Army's vehicle RECAP plans.  Sets of applique kits for fiel d expedient responses to changing operational conditions will also be developed. This is a sole source effort to Oshkosh Truck Corporation.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Program Manager for Light Tactical Vehicles proposes to negotiate a new firm, fixed price contract with AM General Corporation to engineer, integrate and install armor kits for test as part of the PEO CS&CSS Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS).  This  requirement supports needed improvements to the M1151 and M1152 Enhanced Capacity vehicle (ECV) HMMWV to install an integrated flexible armor solution in new production vehicles.  The M1151 is the replacement vehicle for the M1025A2 Armament Carrier HMMWV  while the M1152 is the new utility HMMWV, replacing the M1097A2 for the Army. A need exists for long range improvements in the design of armor protection of tactical wheeled vehicles used to supply and support advancing troops serving in the role of occupying forces during wartime and in civil disaster environments. This effort will result in completion of production designs and a Level III Technical Data Package (TDP) that will allow for integration and procurement of armor protection as kits to vehicles on the original equipment manufacturers' (OEM) production lines  and to the Army's vehicle RECAP plans.  Sets of applique kits for field expedient responses to changing operational conditions will also be developed. This is a sole source effort to AM General Corporation.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>***This modification to the synopsis below is to incorporate the construction range for this project.  The constructions range is between $250,000 and $500,000.

Provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary to replace the two existing air handling units with associated piping, valves, ductwork, and controls, remove hazardous material as indicated, provide electrical work associated with the air handling units replacement, and replace two trip units with current solid equipment in the existing GE switchgear at the Parkersburg Federal Office Building in Parkersburg, WV.

Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.   Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, management and key personnel qualifications, technical and organizational approach, and on their price proposals.

The acquisition shall consist of four phases:  Phase 1 – Receipt and evaluation of technical offers and of initial price proposals.  Phase 2 – Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors and the basis of GSA's opinion.  GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  Phase 3 – A determination of the competitive range shall be developed by the Contracting Officer.  Phase 4 – Completion of negotiations, if necessary.  Receipt and evaluation of final proposal revisions.  

Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 3, without negotiations.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance:  1. Past Performance, 2. Management and Key Personnel Qualifications, and 3. Technical and Organizational Approach.  The NAICS code applicable to this project is 238220 with a small business size standard of $12 million.  This procurement is being conducted as a Total Small Business Set-Aside in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement and there are no Request For Proposal (RFP) documents to download.  This is a Sources Sought Synopsis only.  This synopsis is a market research tool being utilized to determine the availability of qualified Small Business sources prior to issuing RFP.  The Government is seeking qualified 8(a), HUBZONE, or Small Business sources that are certified by the Small Business Administration relative to NAICS Classification 541330, Environmental Engineering Services.  The applicable size standard is $4.0M average annual gross receipts for proceeding three fiscal years.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, and if the Government plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities.  

The general scope of this requirement covers architectural and engineering services to provide multi-media environmental compliance engineering support at various Naval and Marine Corps Installations primarily in California, and to a lesser extent in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and other DOD installations nationwide.  Firms shall provide a full range of environmental management services necessary for the implementation of pollution prevention, compliance, and conservation environmental projects.  These efforts include:  Field investigations and preparing studies/analysis/workplans for environmental projects and other technical support services relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations for air media, water media, hazardous materials, hazardous waste, solid waste, petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL), munitions and explosives of concern (MEC), pollution prevention (P2), GIS mapping, obtaining environmental permits, performing environmental compliance activities, and interfacing with regulatory agencies (Federal/ State/ Local).

The anticipated contract will be a Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract, with a capacity ceiling of $40,000,000.  For evaluation purposes, an even distribution of $8,000,000 per year is assumed.  Individual task orders on the average would range from $500,000 to $2,500,000, and may not exceed $3,000,000 without the agreement of the contractor.  Awardees will be required to comply with FAR 52.219-14 that requires at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance by the prime contractor.  The anticipated contract term will be a base period of one year and four one-year option periods.  Contract completion will occur when the ceiling is reached or at the end of the last option period which ever occurs first.

The Government is looking for the following information from qualified 8(a), HUBZONE, Small Business firms:

(1) Specialized experience of the firm and/or proposed consultants, that was substantially completed in the period between December 2000 to December 2005, in performing multiple, simultaneous projects involving field investigations and preparing studies/analysis/workplans for environmental projects and other support services relating to environmental restoration and with laws and regulations for air media, water media, hazardous materials, hazardous waste, solid waste, petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL), munitions and explosives of concern (MEC), pollution prevention (P2), GIS mapping, obtaining environmental permits, performing environmental compliance activities, and interfacing with regulatory agencies (Federal/ State/ Local) primarily in California, and to a lesser extent in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and other DOD installations nationwide.  Experience in California may be weighted more heavily than experience in other states based on the complexity of the projects.  No more than 10 projects in total will be evaluated. 

(2) Professional qualifications and capabilities of the staff to be assigned to this contract.  Include experience from December 2000 to December 2005 in performing field investigations and preparing studies/analysis/plans relating to environmental studies and other technical support services relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations for air media, water media, hazardous materials, hazardous waste, solid waste, petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL), munitions and explosives of concern (MEC), pollution prevention (P2), GIS mapping, obtaining environmental permits, performing environmental compliance activities, and interfacing with regulatory agencies (Federal/ State/ Local) primarily in California, and to a lesser extend in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and other DOD installations nationwide.  Experience in California may be weighted more heavily than experience in other states based on the complexity of the projects.  Resumes for key personnel are limited to one page each and should cite project specific experience. 

(3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules, and reliability of the firm's quality assurance and quality control program.  Document recent awards and commendations (do not submit copies). 

(4) Location in the general geographic area of Navy and Marine Corps installations primarily in California, and to a lesser extend Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and other DOD installations nationwide and knowledge of the locality in relation to Navy and Marine Corps installations primarily in California, and to a lesser extent in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and other DOD installations nationwide.  Greater weight may be given to location in proximity to Navy and Marine Corps installations in California than in other states, but if proximity to installations in California were comparable with that of other firms, closer proximity to installations in Arizona would be an advantage. 

(5) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Indicate the firm's present workload and the availability of the project team (including consultants) for the specified contract performance period; and indicate specialized equipment, particularly related to state of the art technology.  Include firm’s ability to obtain security clearance(s) for its key personnel.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   Amendment #4 Technical Questions Question #1:  There is no listing anywhere about requirements on size of samples to be measured or footprint size of scan range? Answer: The EPA did not specify, but the EPA estimates 150 to 200 mm in diameter sample size to be  acceptable as a max. Question #2:  There are no definitions about resolution of imaging required or noise levels of the system.  Answer: Section 2.0 subtask #6 did not specify the definitions about resolution of imaging required , but the EPA requires a resolution of 1-2 um, with minimal noise  levels.  The EPA identified  the need to have a vibration table to reduce noise associated with room vibrations, in the specs.  (See 2.0 subtask 6 is revised as follows: Capable of providing a vibration control table, with a resolution of 1-2um, with minimal noise levels.  (This is a necessary  feature for this purchase order, as the EPA facility is known to have vibration issues)    Question #3:  It looks like the bid can be submitted by fax.  Is this correct?     Answer:  Yes, it states in the RFQ fax submissions are acceptable. (email is the preferred method) Question #4:   What is  your definition of stick-slip imaging?  Answer:  The EPA requires a tapping mode feature and wants to avoid stick-slip imaging.  The EPA want to operate in a mode that minimizes stick-slip motion. The due date of quotes reamains unchanged, quotes due November 07, 2005, 3:00PM (EST) Amendment  #3 Technical Questions Question #1:   The "shear force, stick-slip motion" is one type of measurement, while "tapping mode" and "sample compression" are another type.  Are both types required or only one or the other? Answer:  The option to perform both types is requested as stated in the specs,  "Capable of providing shear force, sample compression, and stick-slip motion for high resolution, true surface measurements (e.g. tapping mode AFM operation or operation mode with like capabilities). As a reminder the last day for technical questions is Wednesday, November 02, 2005  Amendment  #2 Technical Questions Question #1:  What are the specifications concerning the surface potential measurement requirement? Answer:  The EPA's  interests lie in the need to determine the surface charge of surfaces and see how the charge varies across a surface.  The surface charge of a corroding  metal, for example, is controlled by surface functional groups on the corrosion deposits that form and understanding how the charge changes across a surface might indicate differences in chemical composition.  The surface charge also plays an important role in controlling the tendency of the  surface to adsorb ions, and the attraction of colloids and attachment of bacteria to the surface.  Experiments designed to see how water chemistry changes the surface charge of metal surfaces, for example and other materials are planned.   Amendment #1 Technical Questions Could the EPA clarify  this portion of the Specifications:  "Capable of meeting the following specifications: electric field microscopy, life-mode capabilities (i.e. magnetic interactions versus topography). Capable of providing preferred simultaneous display of topography image and cantilever oscillation." Question #1:   Does the use of an inexpensive oscilloscope meet the requirements of "display", as compared to an alterative of generating stored data, an acquisition of an image or map? Answer:  It might be best to use an example of an application:  The EPA looks at metal corrosion products frequently and is  interested to know whether certain areas of the corrosion deposits are magnetic and/or electrically conductive, as well as possessing  the need to obtain topography information.   For this requirement the EPA may also be interested to know whether the materials are reactive with certain other  materials or chemical functional groups.  Question #2:  Oscillating cantilever may destroy a tip. Is the requirement to have an oscillating cantilever? Answer: Th all parts, labor, and materials. A one year service agreement must be included in the warranty with the  ability to extend maintenance services (i.e. service agreement) in the future.  4.0  	Delivery Date The completed system shall be delivered no later than 90 days after receipt of award to: 26 W.

Question #2:  Oscillating cantilever may destroy a tip. Is the requirement to have an oscillating cantilever? Answer: The EPA would like to possess the ability to use appropriate modified tips to answer the  questions of reactivity.   It is the EPA's understanding that the simultaneous display of topographic and cantilever oscillation images will permit a qualitative comparison to be made between the material properties of samples.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   Amendment #1 Technical Questions Could the EPA clarify this portion of the Specifications:  "Capable of meeting the following specifications: electric field microscopy, life-mode capabilities (i.e. magnetic interactions versus topography). Capable of providing preferred  simultaneous display of topography image and cantilever oscillation." Question #1:  Does the use of an inexpensive oscilloscope meet the requirements of "display", as compared to an alterative of generating stored data, an acquisition of an image or map? Answer:  It might be best to use an  example of an application:  The EPA looks at metal corrosion products frequently and is interested to know whether certain areas of the corrosion deposits are magnetic and/or electrically conductive, as well as possessing  the need to obtain topography information.   For this requirement the EPA  may also be interested to know whether the materials are reactive with certain other materials or chemical functional groups.  Question #2:  Oscillating cantilever may destroy a tip. Is the requirement to have an oscillating cantilever? Answer: The EPA would like to possess the ability to use  appropriate modified tips to answer the questions of reactivity.   It is the EPA's understanding that the simultaneous display of topographic and cantilever oscillation images will permit a qualitative comparison to be made between the material properties of samples.  Basically, the EPA is looking  for the capability of measuring both height and amplitude for a comparison of the area between the two images.   The Last day for Technical Questions is Thursday November 02, 2005.   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR  Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334513   Amendment #2 Technical Questions Question #1:  What are the specifications concerning the surface potential measurement requirement? Answer:  The EPA's  interests lie in the need to determine the surface charge of surfaces and see how the charge varies across a  surface.  The surface charge of a corroding metal, for example, is controlled by surface functional groups on the corrosion deposits that form and understanding how the charge changes across a surface might indicate differences in chemical composition.  The surface charge also plays an important  role in controlling the tendency of the surface to adsorb ions, and the attraction of colloids and attachment of bacteria to the surface.  Experiments designed to see how water chemistry changes the surface charge of metal surfaces, for example and other materials are planned.   Amendment  #1 Technical Questions Could the EPA clarify this portion of the Specifications:  "Capable of meeting the following specifications: electric field microscopy, life-mode capabilities (i.e. magnetic interactions versus topography).

This effort is anticipated to be awarded under multiple contract types such as Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Firm Fixed Price for a period not to exceed 8 years.  This contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The Boeing Company is the current JDAM prime contractor, and has sole responsibility for design and warranty of the JDAM weapon system.  Boeing is not required to furnish a technical data package to the Systems Program Office, and therefore a data package is not available to interested sources to aid in accomplishment of the JDAM integration on the above-designated platforms.  The scope of this effort shall include procurement of the test and integration hardware/software such as: separation, guided and instrumented guided test vehicles, tail kits, and laboratory weapon simulators, together with technical support for the actual planning, conduct, analysis and documentation of test and resolution of integration issues.  Direct all questions and routine communication concerning this acquisition to Ms. Stacey Darhower, (850) 882- 3525 ext 3059.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns relating to this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager previously identified.  For any other concerns, interested parties may call the Air Armament Center Ombudsman,  Mr. Dennis Love at (850) 882-0312, AAC/XP, 101 West D Avenue, Suite 131, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495.

<DESC>The Air Force Air Mobility Battlelab is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies to enable tanker aircraft to electronically record the tail number and unit information of a receiver aircraft from a passive device, while maintaining low probability of detection and low probability of interception.

AMC loses millions of dollars each year due to non-reimbursement for fuel off-loaded by KC-135s and KC-10s.  With the increasing fuel costs, AMC can no longer continue this trend.  Tanker crews currently collect receiver information thru radio contact, visual identification of the tail number, or both.  The receiver home unit is billed for the amount of fuel.  In communication-out situations or lights-out conditions, the tanker is prevented from making voice/visual contact with the receiver.    

Solutions must work with boom as well as drogue systems and on the KC-135 and KC-10.  Through this RFI, the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies which meet the requirements previously stated.  

This Request For Information (RFI) may be followed by a request for proposal to conduct a Battlelab Concept Demonstration.  All responsible offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.   SUBMISSIONS: Product information may be submitted until 31 Jan 06.  White papers should not exceed five pages and should include cost estimates.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to the Air Mobility Ware Center Battlelab at battlelab@mcguire.af.mil.  THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT CONCERNING THIS RFI IS CAPT JESSICA WILLIAMS.  You may contact Capt Williams with any questions you may have at (609) 754-7938.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL AMB INFORMATION: The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  The AMB strongly encourages partnering with companies to complete demonstrations through cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs), cooperative agreements, or bailment agreements, but does have a small budget to purchase COTS/GOTS-derived hardware.

GENERAL RFI INFORMATION:     The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a requirement for janitorial services for the Child Care Center located at the Department of Commerce, 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado.  The proposed contract is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561720 and the small business size standard is $14.0.  The Request for Quotes (RFQ) number is NAAJ6400600001MAS.  It is the Government’s intent to award this contract for a partial base year with two option years to follow.  This is a Best Value Procurement.  Contractor shall provide all labor, tools, supplies, cleaning materials, equipment and supervision to perform the work specified in the Statement of Work, except for the Government Furnished Equipment.  The janitorial services shall be completed between 6:30 P.M. and 6:30 A.M., Monday through Friday, except for Federal holidays.  The Commerce Children’s Center, a.k.a.

Periodic inspections will be done at the discretion of the Contracting Officer’s Point of Contact (P/OC) to assure compliance with cleaning, health, and safety standards.  It is vital in the performance of this contract that cleaning be of a high quality for the health and safety of the children and adults housed in the Commerce Children’s Center.  The acceptable level of cleaning is almost that of a hospital environment.  This is not an office building, thus, the cleaning is specialized and exacting. The children are aged from infant to preschool and may be crawling on the floor, putting hands and found items in their mouths, etc.  NOAA cannot emphasize enough the criticality of thorough, daily cleaning of the CCC.  The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that their employees comply with current and normal security measures at the facility and the site.  Upon award of contract - the Contractor shall inventory all Government furnished equipment to verify that all equipment as specified does exist at the facility.

Personnel security investigations are required for all contractors entering the site.  Upon “Notice of Contract Award”, all contractors, sub-contractors, their supervisors in charge and all working personnel requiring access to the site shall be required to submit to a background security investigation in accordance with the Department of Commerce Security Regulations. All personnel requiring access to the site must pass the background security investigation, before they will be allowed access to the site or be issued a Photo ID.  The charge for the Security Background Check is $88.00 per each background security investigation performed. The Government will pay for all Security Background Checks performed by DOC Security on the Contractor employees, however, the above statement is limited to only those employees that pass the security background checks.  All background check fees associated with employees that fail the background check will be at the Contractor’s expense and will be back-charged/deducted from the Contractor’s Contract Award Amount. Please contact the Contracting Officer for a site inspection and visit, which will be coordinated with the P/OC.  Evaluation criteria will be included in the formal package. Service Contract Act Wage Rates shall apply. Vendors must also be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  Please contact the Contracting Officer by email at michelle.sandoval@noaa.gov to request a copy of the package.  Technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by fax or by email.  You may submit your quote by email, fax, or by mail.

<DESC>The Tongass National Forest is intending to implement a study of ecologic response to thinning of young growth stands for commercial sized material. The treatment area will encompass  between 188 and 278 acres and include harvest and removal of between 2.7 and 4.4 million board feet of timber among 5 units. The study, on the Thorne Bay Ranger District, Heceta Island, requires that full implementation of treatments be accomplish in a maximum 48 month period but it will be preferred to be completed in a 24 month window.  Treatment implementation methods are fixed according to study specifications, however we maintain a great deal of flexibility in how materials generated from the treatment are cut to length and transported from the study site. 

We are soliciting input from interested vendors on how they might prefer the treatment implementation be packaged.  We expect that the material generated from the study will become the property of the selected contractor and the value of the wood should allow the contractor to reduce the cost to the government for implementation of the study treatment.

Study treatment includes a mixture of strip thinning and individual tree selection and  requires road reconstruction and construction under this proposal.  An option being considered is to complete the road building under a separate contract in 2006.  We request that interested vendors provide us with options and recommendations regarding but not limited to on-site log lengths, log bucking standards, whole tree skidding and associated slash disposal, decking scenarios, log transportation issues including marine access facilities and barging and log rafting.  

We will favor scenarios that include some level of value-added manufacture in Southeast Alaska but solicit input as to desires for export of raw materials.

This is not a request for specific bids or costs at this time and is not a formal pre-solicitation.  This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation or any submission to the sources sought request.  After we receive feedback we will begin preparation of an RFP, which will be available sometime in February.

Additional pertinent documents are available for perusal via the Internet at ftp://ftp2.fs.fed.us/incoming/chugtong_r10/Heceta/.

Please provide any comments by January 17, 2006.  For additional information contact Rick Hauver at the Tongass National Forest, Ketchikan Office @ 907-228-6315 (work phone number).  Written comments can be sent by FAX @ 907-228-6215 or mailing address below.

<DESC>Purpose:  The United States Navy seeks to identify potential sources to perform as the single Product Support Integrator (PSI) for sustaining the Navy/Marine Corp and US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) V-22 aircraft variants.  

Program Description:  The MV-22 aircraft will replace the existing Marine Corps CH-46 and CH-53D helicopters.  The CV 22 aircraft will provide the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) a tilt-rotor aircraft capable of performing  long-range Special Operations Forces (SOF) missions.  The CV-22 retains 88 percent airframe, 100 percent propulsion, and 23 percent avionics commonality with the MV-22.  The program of record includes 360 MV-22 and 50 CV-22 aircraft and an additional 48 HV-22 Fleet Logistics Support, Aerial Refueling and Special Warfare variants. 

Government’s Intent:  The V-22 Program Office (PMA –275) is pursuing a systems-level performance based logistics (PBL) strategy to meet sustainment requirements for MV-22 and CV-22 users.  The intent is to create a sustainment support structure that is comprehensive, responsive to Warfighter requirements and affordable. The Navy’s intent is that the first long-term sustainment PBL contract will be awarded no later than June 2008. The planned length of the initial PBL contract is five years.   

Scope:  Under this PBL, the PSI will share authority, responsibility and risk with the Government for sustainment efficiency and effectiveness. The PSI must establish a formal network that supports long-term relationships and agreements with activities that supply or manage many elements of the V-22 system. This includes: NAVAIR Logistics and Engineering elements and Fleet Support Team, the V-22 original equipment manufacturer (OEM), OEM suppliers and vendors, the Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP), and other government inventory control activities including the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The V-22 is a ‘core’ weapon system under Title 10 USC 2469 provisions. Public-private partnering is a critical part of the V-22 PBL strategy.  The PSI will team, as appropriate, with Naval Aviation Depots, NAVAIR and AFSOC engineering and logistics support facilities, and other activities, which manage components of the MV-22 and CV-22. The contract will incentivize the pursuit of long-term V-22 fleet Operations and Support (O&S) cost reduction initiatives. A key requirement for the PSI will be the ability to work with PMA-275 and supporting Government activities to provide continuous logistics support within the framework of an active modification program, with the systems engineering and configuration management capability that this entails. The Government has procured technical data for this weapon system, to include technical drawings for V-22-peculiar components. This PBL effort includes: aircraft-common supply support for flight simulators and maintenance training devices, upgrade capability for maintenance trainers, technical data packages (MIL-T-3100) and data base access for training system updates, courseware and curriculum changes.  This PBL effort excludes: engines, common support equipment that will be managed and supported separately and components supported by existing PBLs, where inclusion in this contract is not supported by a business case analysis. The PSI will be required to provide software support capabiltities, although the Government will retain overall software support management authority.

Roles and Responsibilities: PMA-275 is the weapon system manager for the operational life of the V-22 fleet and will retain overall authority and accountability for sustainment including operational safety, suitability and effectiveness, configuration control and affordability.  NAVICP will be an integral part of this approach to PBL, and will play critical roles in contract development and execution of supply chain requirements. NAVAIR, NAVICP and the PSI will operate within a long-term, performance-based contract structure using performance metrics and strong incentives aligned to meet Warfighter needs. Performance-based agreements (PBAs) between PMA-275 and both Warfighters documenting user support needs and Fleet performance metrics are provided as Attachments A and B.  Detailed PSI responsibilities are contained in Attachment C.  Respondents are expected to describe capabilities and demonstrated experience, which would support successful execution of these responsibilities.

Integrated Data Systems:  Implementation of this PBL concept will require near-real-time technical, logistics and programmatic data management capability using an integrated information technology network.  The PSI must have the capability to interface with both Navy and Air Force logistics information systems and databases. Also, the PSI’s financial systems must be capable of managing cost performance matrices involving multiple appropriations and Service-unique requirements. Additionally, these systems must be able to link and report expenditures to various funding sources. 


Aircraft Basing Concept:  Basing assignment of  the 50 CV-22 and 360 MV-22 aircraft is planned as follows:  CV-22 aircraft are currently projected for four bases - two CONUS, Kirtland AFB and Hurlburt Field, and two OCONUS bases in EUCOM and PACOM. MV-22 aircraft will be based at three CONUS bases - MCAS New River, MCAS Miramar and MCAS Pendleton, two OCONUS bases and sea bases as required. Basing assignment is subject to change. Both Services will require the PSI to be capable of providing worldwide support to CONUS and OCONUS fixed-base and deployed locations including supporting shipboard operations.

Foreign Military Sales:  The PBL contract will be constructed to facilitate the future incorporation of Foreign Military Sales customer support requirements, to include supply chain management, technical data and sustaining engineering. The PSI must be capable of supporting FMS, as well as domestic, customer requirements 

AIRSpeed :  The PSI should be capable of participating as a partner with NAVAIR and naval aviation maintenance activities in productivity improvement initiatives exemplified by the AIRSpeed program.  

Contract Type:  An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity task order type contract is anticipated for both the initial and follow-on contracts.  It is anticipated that, throughout the term of the initial PBL contract, various CLINs within the contract will carry differing contract types suited to the scope, predictability, variability, and risk associated with the work to be performed under that CLIN.  Contract incentives will be targeted to motivate specific contractor performance, which supports short- and long-term Warfighter objectives described in the PBAs. Industry is reminded that the Navy discourages exclusive teaming arrangements that inhibit competition (NAVAIR 5252.215-9505). Additionally, the PBL contract will require and incentivize the PSI to actively look for opportunities to engage small, small disadvantaged, women owned, veteran owned, and HUB zoned businesses, along with Historically Black Colleges and Universities in performing work under the PBL contract.  


Responses:  NAVAIR requests that companies respond by submitting a plan for a PBL approach for the program in whole and/or in individual areas of interest, to include examples of previous logistic support efforts, along with any other related information. Submissions are limited to 50 double-spaced printed pages including attachments and one printed and one electronic copy must be submitted to NAVAIR.  Emailed submissions will not be accepted by NAVAIR.  Copies of the PBAs and Product Support Integrator Responsibilities will be posted to the NAVAIR web site http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.  The Government will not reimburse any preparation costs. Submissions will not be returned.  Interested parties responding in writing may be given an opportunity, after review of their written response, to provide a presentation on their PBL plan.  The presentation will be limited to an hour and half, 45 minutes for presentation and 30 minutes for questions.  Presentations will be schedule after submission review.

Written and/or electronic media responses to this announcement must be received no later than 26 January 2006 and can be submitted to:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations document (FAR) subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This announcement is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) in accordance with the following Statement of Objectives: Electronic Records Pilot Contract Support  Minerals Revenue Management (MRM) Records Management Improvement Project - Phase II  Overall Objective: The objective of the Records Management Improvement Project (RMIP) is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of MRM operations.  This objective will be attained by updating the disposition and retention schedules in the MMS Records Management handbook, implementing recordkeeping practices throughout MRM that comply with MMS, DOI, and NARA regulations, and optimizing the use of technological and contractual resources to support the MRM records program.   Background Information: RMIP - Phase I focused on paper records and was successfully completed in April 2005.  RMIP - Phase II, focusing on electronic records, is a multi-year effort requiring extensive coordination with other MMS and DOI organizations.  The FY06 Phase II activities include performing an inventory of all MRM electronic records, developing and maintaining a vital records program, and designing, implementing and evaluating an electronic records pilot.   Per agreement with the DOI CIO office, MRM is coordinating its Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) and Electronic Records Management System (ERMS) activities with the MMS Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) program area.  Since OMM had selected EMC Documentum repository architecture as the software vendor for its EDMS and ERMS activities, MRM will also use EMC Documentum.   Formal pilot requirements are established in 36 CFR 1234 and DOD Standard 5015.2. One additional pilot objective is to meet the functional requirements of the service components described for a service oriented architecture in the Records Management Service Components Requirements Development Project Final Report (http://www.archives.gov/era/pdf/rmsc0305.pdf). Program Objectives: 1) To implement the EMC Documentum EDMS and ERMS software as part of a pilot program for a selected group of     approximately 30 to 40 MRM employees all located in Lakewood, Colorado.   2)  To evaluate the pilot implementation of the software against the program requirements, develop strategies to      ensure employee acceptance and use of the procedures and the software, and develop lessons learned and      best practices for possible full implementation MRM-wide.    Contract Objectives: The contract objective is to obtain a contractor that will: 1)	Review pilot plans, policies and guidelines;  2)	Implement guidance regarding configuration and parameters;  3)	Provide Documentum lessons learned and best practices; 4)	Assist with change management issues related to this recordkeeping initiative; 5)	Provide a management briefing that critically and objectively evaluates the pilot program.  Management Objectives: The management objectives are to minimize the risk of a failed pilot through the application of Documentum expertise, best practices and lessons learned - with regard to policy and procedure, implementation configuration and parameters, and knowledge transfer. Schedule: Performance of the contract is scheduled to start in January 2006, and scheduled to end September 30, 2006.  If the MMS management decides to pursue an MRM-wide implementation of Documentum, an option to extend will be offered on an annual basis for one to three years. If MMS management determines the pilot is successful and pursues a phased MRM-wide implementation of Documentum and integration with the OMM EDMS/ERMS initiative, the contractor shall be engaged to review implementation plans, provide implementation guidance regarding configuration and parameters, provide analysis regarding centralization versus decentralization, and ensure consideration of best practices and lessons learned.  Evaluation Criteria: 1. Technical Capability - Proposal demonstrates a complete understanding of the requirement described in the Statement of Objectives. 2. Price 3. Past Performance - Proposal demonstrates the relevancy and success in past performance efforts of similar scope, size, and complexity in accordance with the RFP. BEST VALUE FOR AWARD A contract will be awarded to the responsible offeror whose quote is the most advantageous to the Government in terms of technical capability, price, and past performance.  In terms of importance, price and past performance, when combined, are equal to technical capability.  Although technical factors are considered paramount to price, the closer the technical scores, the more important price becomes.  Accordingly, the Government may issue a contract to other than the lowest priced offer.  The Government reserves the right to make the best value award. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-05.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Integrated Genomics, Inc. for bioinformatics processing of 13(thirteen) genomes, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML #6004. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-06 dated 10/31/05. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories(RML), has been charged with performing basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of a custom microarray chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing the open reading frames of 13(thirteen) bacterial pathogen genomes, condensed into composite, and or single genomes will contribute towards achieving those goals. The contractor shall provide to RML services to construct and provide sequence and annotation files for bacterial genomes that shall conform to specifications defined by Affymetrix in the GeneChip® CustomExpress™ Array Design Guide and approved in advance by the Affymetrix Chip Design Team. Labor categories may be suggested by the vendor and approved in advance by the Project Officer.  This is a 10(ten) week, one time work effort, where the final product shall be the production of flat files, 2(two) per composite or single genome.  RML has a need for the contractor to use URLs and RML data, some of which is incorporated into the RML ERGO server to construct final files for each of the genomes discussed below.  These final files will be Fasta files of ORFs and annotation files for those ORFs in tab-delimited format with column headers.  2(two) files total, per composite, or single genome effort shall be constructed, one in fasta format and the other in annotation format.  Unique identifiers specific to ERGO annotations for all orfs present in the RML ERGO server shall be incorporated into the annotation files. The final Fasta and annotation files shall match the format Affymetrix requests. The final Fasta and annotation files shall meet Project Officer specifications. During the production of the files the contractor shall communicate with Affymetrix and the Project Officer in order to make sure that compliance with Affymetrix design requirements in the form of these files is occurring.  A final Conference call will occur with the RML Project Officer and Affymetrix and the contractor to make sure that all of Affymetrix file requirements have been met at the end of the contract.  The following genomes, shall be included in this effort: A. Burkholderia sp. genomes: 1. Burkholderia cenocepacia J231.  2. Burkholderia mallei. 3. Burkholderia strain 383. 4. Burkholderia vietnamensis strain G4. 5. Burkholderia pseudomallei 1026b. 6. Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243.  B. Mycobacterium sp. genomes: 1. Mycobacterium leprae.  2. Mycobacterium marinum M. 3. Mycobacterium smegmati.  4. Mycobacterium avium strain avium. 5. Mycobacterium avium strain pseudotuberculosis.  6. Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain CDC155.  7. Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv. The contractor shall keep all RML-derived data secure and will not release or maintain any of the data beyond this contract effort. If Internet connectivity is needed in order to perform the work, or transfer deliverables, contractor computers will be secure and in compliance with RML IT security procedures and policies.  The RML will provide genomic data in the form of flat files and up-to-date
assembly files in ace format with all supporting chromatogram files if needed.  All genomes shall undergo intra- and inter-comparative analysis in order to identify regions of duplication and uniqueness.  For composite genome construction, one genome shall be designated as the backbone genome and shall be represented in the orf and annotation flat files in its near entirety (absent homologous repetitive sequences at a 97% DNA identity or higher).  Subsequent genomes that are within the same genus, but that will make up the composite aspects of the genome will only be represented at the level of unique sequences not present in the backbone genome (at 96% DNA identity or less).  Annotation must reflect this origin of sequence and the connection to the backbone genome. Decisions regarding whether to perform composite construction versus individual genome representation shall be based upon the contractor running test analyses, which may or may not involve BLAST searches/comparisons at different levels of DNA identity or similarity stringencies.  If genomes are syntenous, composite construction can work, if they are nonsyntenous, demonstrating many genomic changes and differences, then independent representation might be the best option. Final decisions on composite versus single or independent representation shall be made following discussion and approval with the Project Officer.  Final annotation and flat files shall have unique orf identifiers connected to the ERGO server and compatible with the ERGO server.  The Contractor must have access, experience and proprietary rights for interacting with the ERGO server such that interactions will not void or cancel existing service and support contracts for the ERGO SERVER. Affymetrix shall be the sole source for probe pair design, synthesis and manufacturing of the chip.  Sequence and annotation files shall be submitted to Affymetrix by the contractor following review and approval by the RML project Officer.  Step 1:  Receipt of all genomic materials  Duration: From date of receipt of materials,  Total 10(ten) days.  Deliverables: The contractor shall provide to RML confirmation that for each genome category effort, the contractor has all of the necessary materials to proceed effectively.  A brief report shall also be provided outlining any areas of potential difficulty.  The contractor may begin work on flat file construction when all of the genomic data for that effort has been received or has been made available.  Step 2: Sequence scanning and analysis of all genomes.  Duration: 1-2 months total from end of receipt of materials (Step 1) for all composite, and single genomes to delivery of flat files to Affymetrix.   Deliverables: Two flat files for each composite and single genome effort, consisting of a sequence flat file and an annotation file shall be delivered by email, ftp or on CD to the project officer for review and forwarded onto Affymetrix.  Flat files delivered to Affymetrix for each genome effort shall be 100% compatible with Affymetrix design criteria as defined by Affymetrix. Composite and single genome flat file sets, including, but not limited to fasta orf files and annotation files may be delivered individually per group and invoiced as such, following acceptable review by the project officer.  Inspection Criteria: All work for all composite genomes will be inspected and approved by the project officer or his designee via the reports and flat files submitted.  Acceptance Criteria: will be based upon decisions made by RML and the Project Officer.  FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT. Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

A camera with a noise equivalent temperature difference better than .05 degrees is preferred.  Also preferred is a camera operator with extensive experience at surveying wildlife.
