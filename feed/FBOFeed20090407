<DESC>DESCRIPTION: TITLE: F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Modernization Program   This Notice of Contractual Action is a  Pre-Solicitation Notice in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) 5.201 and 5.203(a).  The 912th AESG - F-15 Systems Group,  Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio plans to issue Request for Proposal (RFP)  FA8634-08-R-2650 for the Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Obsolescence  Program.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The anticipated RFP  release date is March 14, 2008.  The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an  Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) program. The F-15 ESTS is an  Intermediate ? level support equipment system providing maintenance &  repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU). The system  consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary equipment,  and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations and the  depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill. The  station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to maintain  and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY09 unless known obsolescence  for a variety of component parts is not addressed.  The overarching  program objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission Capable (NMC).  The program will accomplish this by replacing instruments contained within  the station that are projected to be obsolete over the next several years.  The Air Force does not have program authority to replace or redesign the  ESTS station.  The planned funding profile is as follows: FY09 - $13.11M,  FY10 - $10.88M, FY11 - $15.86M.  Interested parties may view and/or  download the full RFP by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities  (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  The ESTS Bidders  Library has been posted to the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS)  Website @https://www.fedteds.gov/ which provides a direct link to the RFP  in FedBizOpps.  All responsible small business sources may submit a  proposal which shall be considered.  Foreign participation is not  permitted at the prime contractor level.  Address issues, concerns, and  questions regarding this acquisition to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Barry  Foster; E-Mail barry.foster@wpafb.af.mil.  An Ombudsman has been appointed  to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal  development phase of this acquisition.  You may refer them to the  Ombudsman if, after discussing them with the Contracting Officer, you feel  that you are not effectively communicating with the government. The  Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or  Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues,  disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government  personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict  confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not  participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection  process. The ASC Ombudsman is Karen Emery, ASC/CS, 1865 4th Street, Bldg  14, Room 203, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 (Phone: 937-255-6356; E- Mail  karen.emery@wpafb.af.mil). Information contained in this synopsis is for  information and planning purposes only.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI),Genetic Epidemiology Branch, plans to procure on a sole source basis with deCODE Genetics, 1000 Winter St. Suite 3100, Waltham, MA 02451.  The contractor will perform genotyping with microsatellite markers on genomic DNA samples extracted from blood collected from 1,500 participants in nasopharyngeal carcinoma families.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541711 and the business size standard in 500 employees.  This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to conduct fine-mapping by genotyping additional microsatellite markers in the regions showing suggestive linkage signals in the genome-wide scan.  Specifically, genomic DNA from 1500 individuals in about 200 Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) multiplex families will be genotyped for deCODE fine mapping markers at 2 cM interval.</p>
<p>The results are required in order to confirm or exclude linkage regions that showed linkage signals in the initial genome-wide scan. These data will be critical in narrowing the regions for candidate gene sequencing.</p>
<p><br />The vendor shall provide:</p>
<p>1.	Genotyping data <br />2.	Map locations for markers genotyped <br />3.	Marker allele frequencies <br />4.         Mendelian inconsistency check</p>
<p><br />Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>1.	Design and validate microsatellite markers in the regions that NCI provides;<br />2.	Provide 2-ml screw-cap tubes for the DNA, boxes labeled with order ID, and barcode labels for tubes.<br />3.	Check whether the DNA is enough for 40 STR fine mapping and at the required concentration;<br />4.	Conduct extensive QC before, during, and after genotyping according to deCODE procedure.  QC before genotyping includes OD measurements, normalization and a panel of 50 STR on all samples to see that they all perform;<br />5.	Conduct genotyping and include appropriate CEPH individuals as quality controls;<br />6.	Deliver genotyping results and map files;<br />7.	Provide technical guidance and trouble shooting to the NCI Project Officer on the work performed under this procurement.</p>
<p>deCODE Genetic's genotyping service delivers rapid-turnaround, high-quality data for linkage analyses.  The company operates the largest and most advanced high-throughput microsatellite and SNP array genotyping facility in the world. Backed by years of experience, deCODE has created the most complete genetic map of the human genome and an unrivalled track record in mapping and validating disease genes for common diseases. deCODE has successfully genotyped 360 individuals for ~1000 microsatellite markers in the genome-wide scan for melanoma family study in DCEG. Their service was fast and had great quality, with high allele call rate and extremely low Mendelian inconsistencies. For fine mapping, deCODE has over 15,000 validated markers that successfully have been used for genotyping. The well validated marker set required to follow-up on the two regions of interest to our study are uniquely available through deCODE, therefore justifying the need to this procurement.</p>
<p><br />This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) seeks to procure on a sole source basis with Dr. Deborah Ann Colosi, Bethesda, MD 20816. The contractor will provide recommendations and guidance to the NIMH in developing a background report on the current use of combination therapy for treating the neurological complications of HIV/AIDS.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard in $7.0M. This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will allow NIMH to carry out the activities of managing the HIV/AIDS program in preventing or treating the neurological complications which frequently accompany HIV disease. Therapeutic approaches have realized much success in managing HIV/AIDS; however strategies to prevent or treat the neurological complications that frequently accompany HIV disease have been less successful. This is due to limited availability of drugs across the blood brain barrier, the high degree of toxicity that accompanies long term use of current antiretroviral drugs, and the co-morbid mental health conditions that frequently accompany HIV/CNS disease, such as depression, anxieties, mood disorders, as well as others. While the extreme manifestations of AIDS dementia complex have decreased in frequency, less severe but nevertheless debilitating neurological complications persist. This is particularly important as individuals with HIV are living longer with compromised ability to function, also exacerbated by the normal aging processes in an increasing proportion of this population. The NIMH proposes to develop a background report on the current use of combination therapy for treating the neurological complications of HIV/AIDS. In addition to this report, NIMH proposes to develop a workshop with key therapeutic researchers in the field to review neuropathogenesis research. This will help to identify research priorities and inform the development of a set of strategic goals to meet the needs of this important scientific component of the broad management of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct a literature review and prepare a report on the current availability and use of therapeutics to treat/manage HIV/CNS. This report shall include a review of the current antiretroviral drugs in use as well as classes of neurotropic/ neuroactive drugs that have been identified that may synergize with antiretrovirals and enhance their potential for success. Potential tissue toxicities or toxic drug interactions must be included. Level of clinical testing that has been conducted on each drug will also be included. The contractor shall also conduct a workshop of key researchers in the field to discuss current therapeutics and therapeutic strategies and to develop a state of the science report built on the literature review and the discussions at the workshop. The report will include a model for a pipeline that can facilitate the development and clinical testing of the new and current drugs, and to develop a set of goals to address this critical need.</p>
<p>The contractor must have the following background in order to be qualified to successfully carry out the requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Experience in the area of industrial translational research.</p>
<p>&bull; Extensive experience in collaborating across disciplines with industry and academia to move HIV related projects through preclinical evaluation and into the clinic.</p>
<p>&bull; Extensive experience in planning and implementing workshops.</p>
<p>&bull; Leadership experience in the conduct of developing therapeutics across disciplines and experience in HIV-related preclinical translational research.</p>
<p>&bull; Extensive experiences must include academic credentials and demonstrated publications of HIV related translational research in an industrial setting.</p>
<p>&bull; Extensive research experience as evidenced by at least 15 years in translational research projects.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the NIMH Center for Mental Health Research on AIDS requires strong background in basic and neuroscience as well as expertise in the literature review and developing report on current therapeutics and therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>Dr. Deborah Ann Colosi has both the unique background and expertise to contribute to the novel therapeutics. Her research has focused on developing therapeutics across disciplines and in HIV-related preclinical translational research.</p>
<p>Dr. Colosi has the perspective of having worked as a Senior Research Scientist at Bayer HealthCare pharmaceuticals and lectured at California State University, Hayward. Dr. Colosi's expertise with research developing therapeutics across disciplines and her expertise in HIV-related preclinical translational research make her uniquely qualified to lead the NIMH's effort in supporting new treatment concepts in NeuroAIDS which can be integrated into clinical practice and open new research directions. Dr. Colosi is the only known source with the appropriate expertise and knowledge who can fulfill the NIMH's requirements.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-480-1358 or sent via email to ln18x@nih.gov. It is the vendor's responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in and have valid certifications in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) www.orca.bpn.gov.

<SUBJECT>G:Box Chemi HR16 Gel Documentation System
<SOLNBR>NOI1011422
<RESPDATE>041709
<CONTACT>Liem T Nguyen, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014358780, Email ln18x@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) on behalf of National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to procure on a sole source basis a gel documentation and analysis system from SYNGENE, 5108 Pegasus Court, Frederick, MD 21704.
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Itenms and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.5 to use Simplified Acquisition Procedure for commercial items.</p>
<p>The G-Box Chemi HR16, manufactured by Syngene, is a gel documentation and analysis system. Using its UV transilluminator, researchers can capture and analyze images of DNA gels stained with ethidium bromide or SYBR Green. Visible light applications include viewing and analyzing gels stained with silver stain or coomassie blue (protein gels), tissues, slides and films. The GBox is also capable of detecting and analyzing chemiluminescent samples, for example, western blots. Additional applications include capture and analysis of spot blots and an ability to image a wide range of fluorescent samples. The software provided for analysis of samples is excellent and user friendly. This instrument is manufactured locally and has a 3 year warranty.</p>
<p>The principal goal of the NINDS Synaptic Function Unit (SFU) is to study the molecular mechanisms underlying neurotransmitter release and its modulation. SFU scientists rely on a combination of techniques and equipment to conduct research. Purchasing this system will permit NINDS/SFU scientists to analyze DNA and protein studies, both of which are an integral part of all of the projects in SFU lab. The simple design of the G-Box gives NINDS-SFU the flexibility to configure the machine for NINDS' requirement. The camera and lens include PC keyboard control of settings including aperture, zoom and focus, and these settings can be saved and recalled for future captures. It is found that the GeneSnap image capture software very easy to navigate. In particular, the fully automatic package that controls the camera integration, exposure, lens and capture options, with auto focus configurations and focus indicator is a big advantage of this machine. Considering the number of users in NINDS-SFU lab and the NINDA-SFU flexibility to allow individuals from other labs to use NINDS-SFU system, a more automated lens (aperture, focus, zoom) and exposure (auto exposure or series capture, for example) will best fit NINDS-SFU's needs maintenance-wise. The zoom lens allows NINDS-SFU staff to maximize use of available camera pixels independent of sample size. The camera includes 8 separate aperture settings, which will maximize the image intensity control for optimal image capture. The darkroom has an automatic door lock for measurements over 30 seconds, thus preventing the accidental opening of the darkroom during critical long exposures. During data capture, NINDS-SFU can receive up to 5 megapixel image output allowing multi-level zooming of the image with no pixilation of the data. NINDS-SFU staff also have the flexibility to control image sensitivity by the binning mode selected. The GeneSnap software utilizes auto lane finding, auto band finding and baseline correction mode, which minimizes user bias when analyzing data and ensures repeatability. The software also includes the rolling disk baseline correction algorithm, which is an advanced algorithm that permits accurate separation of data from noise independent of width of bands, and a data smoothing algorithm to eliminate false positives related to background noise.</p>
<p>Finallly, as the ever expanding list of fluorescent labels available requires an array of EPI and transillumination light sources, NINDS-SFU can incorporate more advanced lighting for these applications with a simple upgrade which will allow the use of these technologies in the future without having to replace the gel documentation system.</p>
<p>The G:Box Chemi HR16 Gel Documentation System and the accompany software are designed and manufactured by SYNGENE. SYNGENE is the only known source to NINDS-SFU who can provide this system.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed the vendor may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NINDS to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the Office of Acquisitions, NIDA, on or before 2:00 PM ET April 17, 2009. All questions must be in writing and can be emailed to Liem T Nguyen at ln18x@nih.gov or faxed to 301-480-1358 no later than 2:00 PM ET April 15, 2009. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determinng whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award from the NIDA vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Elaine Scarnici, 508-233-4585

<a href="mailto:elaine.m.scarnici@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Natick</a>
<DESC>The Product Manager  Force Sustainment Systems, US Army Soldier Systems Center, Natick, MA, has a requirement for an Advanced Cargo Parachute Release System (ACPRS) to be used with the upcoming Advanced Low Velocity Airdrop System (ALVADS), meant to conduct airdrop operations at 500-ft above ground level (AGL).  The new ACPRS will also eventually replace the current M-1 and M-2 parachute releases used in standard Low Velocity Air Drop (LVAD) so as to provide a more reliable release device which  operates equally well under all weather conditions (e.g., wind directions) on the drop zone. The new ACPRS, used with either a single or clustered parachute configuration, shall have the following performance characteristics. 1) Capable of delivering combat loads having suspended weights between 200 pounds through 42,000 pounds. 2) Capable of withstanding the forces typically associated with LVAD operations from military cargo aircraft traveling between 130-150 knots indicated air speed (KIAS).  3) The release shall hold from 1 to 8 cargo parachutes.  4) The release shall be easy and quick for an Army rigger to attach to each of the four (4) payload suspension slings and to each of the parachute risers and shall be equal to or less than the rigging time to attach the M-1 & M-2 releases.  5) The ACPRS shall be designed to allow each parachute to be released separately from the other parachutes and the load.  6) The release shall be capable of releasing the parachute(s) when the platform impacts the ground and release equally, in any direction, in ground wind speeds of 17 knots (threshold) (21 knots (objective)).   Please note that, for LVAD operations, the maximum rate of descent at ground impact will not exceed 28.5 ft/sec.  7) The component reliability of the ACPRS shall be at least 0.98 and shall not cause the overall operational reliability of LVAD system to be less than 0.92.  8) The ACPRS shall be capable of operation and storage in climatic categories (hot, basic, cold, and severe cold) as defined in Army Regulation (AR) 70-38.  9) Any proposed pyrotechnic device shall already be certified by the Army for military use in the intended application.  10) Any electrically operated device shall use commercial-off-the-shelf batteries and have a built in test circuit to show that the battery is operable and the electrical circuit is ready to fire. 11) Emphasis on durable lightweight materials and low/simplified maintenance is highly desired. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued and offerors proposals will be evaluated to determine the items ability to meet the above requirements. An IDIQ contract is planned for this requirement.  This effort will consist of a base period for at least two (2) vendors which shall include a Design Validation (DV) phase with options for Developmental (DT), Operational Testing (OT) and a Production Delivery Order.  Proposals will undergo an initial evaluation to determine the ability of the offerors proposed system to meet the ACPRS requirements.  At the conclusion of the initial evaluation, a competitive range will be established and offerors of proposals which fall within the competitive range will be invited to participate in oral presentation and display hardware of their proposed system.  A down select to at least two (2) offerors will be conducted based on results from the offerors initial proposal evaluation, oral presentation and display, and the offerors Final Proposal Revision (FPR) for a competitive DV phase.  One vendor will be chosen at conclusion of the competitive DV phase to continue on to DT, OT and possible Production phase based on how well the proposed system meets program requirements and availability of funding. The Base Efforts DV option will include CLINs for ACPRS hardware, engineering, rigging, and technical support for each respective test effort.  The Base Effort will require at least eight (8) ACPRSs systems.  Test items will undergo evaluation for fit, form and function, and will also be subjected to airdrop testing.   The Government may exercise Option 1 upon successful completion of the Base Effort.  Option 1 will require the delivery of at least twelve (12) ACPRSs as well as documentation and technical publications.  These systems will be subjected to DT to determine if they satisfy all the performance requirements identified in the CPD.  Option 2 is to deliver at least twelve (12) production representative ACPRSs.  These items will be subjected to OT to determine if they satisfy all the ACPRS operational effectiveness and suitability requirements.  Option 2 will also include the requirement for the delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) (to include complete drawings, lists, and detailed specifications).  Upon completion of OT, an Initial Production Option 3 may be issued to meet the fielding requirements of the ACPRSs with the exact quantity dependent on availability of funding. This acquisition will be set aside for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code is 8711 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.  The RFP will be posted to the Natick Contracting Divisions web site located at https://www3.natick.army.mil/, under Business Opportunities on/about May 2009. NO hardcopies will be mailed. Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Roberta.f.Boswell, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at Roberta.F.Boswell@us.army.mil.  Firms will not be reimbursed for any cost associated with proposal preparation.<BR><BR>

<a href="mailto:jason.moy1@us.army.mil">US Army C-E LCMC Acquisition Center - DAAB07</a>
<DESC>SYNOPSIS:<BR><BR>The United States Army CECOM Contracting Center intends to solicit on a full and open, best value source selection, Counter Remote Control Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) upgrade to the AN/VLQ-12(V)2 Countermeasures Set (also known as the Duke V2 system).  The Army anticipates a competitive 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Firm Fixed Price production contract for the Duke V2 Upgrade, along with a time and Materials line items for Interim Contractor Logistics Support (ICLS), Engineering Services, Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) and Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I).  <BR><BR>The Governments intent is to upgrade, not replace the Duke V2 system.  This upgrade will permit the Duke V2 to maintain relevancy in an adaptive radio controlled improvised explosive device (RCIED) threat environment.  The Duke V2 Upgrade will be an immediate acquisition with focus on frequency coverage, range, interoperability with other CREW systems; compatibility with Army Blue Force communications and meeting the size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements.  This program is in response to an urgent requirement.  This is not a development program, production deliveries of this critical capability must begin within six (6) months of contract award, and support high volume production deliveries beginning 2Q FY-10 (i.e. 1000 units/month). No technical data package exists for the system; however a Duke V2 Upgrade Performance Specification and a Duke V2 Interface Control Document (ICD) are available. As part of the source selection process, production representative systems will be evaluated in Laboratory and Field environments to assess performance and risk.  All offerors must have a SECRET clearance. No classified data or information shall be posted on the IBOP.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army CECOM Contracting Center has established the IBOP website as part of the Armys Single Face to Industry, to allow electronic posting of Solicitations for Request for Proposals (RFPs) from CECOM Contracting Center to Industry. All parties who are interested in doing business with CECOM Contracting Center are invited to access, operate, send and receive information from the IBOP at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.

<a href="mailto:raushanah.m.muhammad@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is soliciting prospective contractors for the restoration of Nashawannuck Pond. Nashawannuck Pond is a man-made impoundment located in the City of Easthampton within the Connecticut River Basin, formed at the confluence of Broad and White Brooks. The pond has an area of 31 acres.  The projects purpose is to restore the degraded aquatic habitat which has resulted from sedimentation.  The project would remove approximately 55,000 cubic yards (CY) of fine-grained sediment from Nashawannuck Pond while the pond is fully drained.   The limits of the excavation would be to a depth of 12 feet focusing primarily upon the White Brook and Broad Brook cove areas, extending northward.  The recommended method for sediment removal at Nashawannuck Pond is complete drainage of the pond by lowering the existing bascule gate at the spillway, and then completely drained by opening one or more of the sluice gates at the side of the dam.  After the pond is dewatered, mechanical excavation (using land based excavation equipment) of the exposed sediments will be undertaken.  The sediments will be loaded onto trucks and hauled to a city owned upland (non-wetland) disposal area located approximately 1-1/8 miles (mi) to the southwest.   Existing flows from both Broad and White Brooks will be diverted away from the sediments to be excavated by excavating a central channel through the pond prior to complete drawdown and using silt fencing to control turbidity.  In addition, a temporary weir will be installed at the upstream side of the culvert connecting Nashawannuck Pond to Rubber Thread Pond under Williston Avenue.  The temporary weir will maintain the surface elevation of Rubber Thread Pond during the excavation activities.   During construction the sluice gates will be adjusted to continually discharge a minimum outflow equal to the inflow of the three tributaries.  At the completion of the excavation, the sluice gates will be partially closed in order to maintain a downstream flow, and allow the pond to refill.  It is anticipated that the refilling of the pond will take approximately three months. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990 with a size standard of $33.5 million. This solicitation will be issued as an 8(a) competitive set-aside. The estimated issue date for the solicitation is on or about 27 April 2009. Interested bidders can download the solicitation via the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). The due date for the bid will be stated in the solicitation. Requests for solicitation documents by telephone, fax, or email will not be honored. Instructions for bid submissions will be provided in the solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a bid for consideration by the New England District.

<DESC><p>The United States Air force is seeking information from interested parties on a space environment sensing capability that will address sensors and systems to collect space environmental parameters.&nbsp; Acquisition of the capability start in Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 2010 with an initial capability in GFY2015.&nbsp; The capability is required through GFY 2020.&nbsp; The Air Force has a requirement to continue to provide space environmental data in the most cost effective way possible when the DMSP mission ends.&nbsp; The requirement basis for this effort is the Natioanl Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellite System NPOESS IORD-II, Joint Requirement Operations Council approved, Oct 2001.&nbsp; Furthermore this effort will be filling a void that will allow continuity of space environmental measurements and preservation of national capabilities required today and in the future as the United State formulates plans for&nbsp;National Space Situational Awareness architecture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Air Force is interested in addressing the gap resulting from the de-manifestation of the space environmental sensing capabilities from the National Polar-Orbiting environmental Satellite System (NPOESS).&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important is the rapid collection, ingestion, processing, analysis, exploitation, and dissemination in a manner suitable to user needs.&nbsp; Therefore, the Air Force is interested in companies who understand both the operational systems in place to provide space environmental products and how to improve the sensor-toshooter chain of events to improce space environment situation awareness and application for strategic and tactical operations.&nbsp; The Air Force is evaluating all possible solutions sets, including the employment of commercial systems as a data provider with sensors already on-orbit or hosting sensors on future platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective is to define an acquisition program that uses low-risk technologies (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 or greater) previously integrated on a bus and launch vehicles (if necessary) provided by contractors with a documented proven track record of mission success. We encourage collaboration among industry partners to identify innovative approaches for exploiting already available data to provide parameters we are seeking. For planning purposes, we would anticipate an incremental delivery strategy to rapidly fill the data collection gap, while concurrently investing in space weather modeling and system effects Science and Technology essential to translate measurements into actionable space weather products. This is in line with the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for Space's letter dated 14 March 2007, titled "'Back to Basics' and Implementing a Block Approach for Space Acquisition". !! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;16b. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to seek information on current, existing technologies (or with possible minor modifications) that can be used to meet the sensing capabilities described in this paragraph and paragraph 16d. Cost is a major consideration; therefore, the government is interested in cost information for individual requirements defined in paragraph 16d. The DMSG program office is interested in information from Industry as well as Government Labs.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the Government is working with the nation's national laboratories to leverage their wealth of knowledge in space environment. The complement of government resources and industry experts would provide an overall space environment sensing and exploitation program that optimizes the investment. We are not seeking competition between government labs and industry. The government team will conduct a thorough analysis of present and future space environment models, applications, system effects algorithms, and decision aids and generate roadmaps and product threads for delivering improved space environment situation awareness user products using Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) data.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Air Force will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued. !!</p>
<p>16c. DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>AFWA - Air Force Weather Agency <br />C3 - Command, Control and Communications <br />DMSP - Defense Meteorological Satellite Program<br />DoD - Department of Defense <br />EDR - Environmental Data Record <br />GFY - Government Fiscal Year <br />ICD - Interface Control Document <br />IOC - Initial Operational Capability<br />IORD - Integrated Operational Requirements Document <br />KPP - Key Performance Parameters<br />KSA - Key Support Areas<br />NPOESS - National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System <br />POC - Point of Contact<br />RFI - Request for Information <br />SDR - Sensor Data Record<br />SSAEM - Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring<br />TRL -Technology Readiness Level</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16d. SENSING CAPABILITY INFORMATION SOUGHT</p>
<p>For this effort, the IORD-II ionospheric electron density profile characteristics and scintillation measurements are considered Key Performance Parameters (KPP) and must be satisfied. We are searching for possible solutions to satisfy the remaining Environmental Data Records (EDRs), considered as Key Support Areas (KSA) and are seeking possible innovative approaches to solve multiple requirements. The following list is the environmental data records as approved by the Senior User Advisory Group in priority order and are based on recommendations from the NPOESS Joint Agency Requirements Group:</p>
<p>1. Electron Density Profile<br />2. Ionospheric Scintillation<br />3. Neutral Density Profile<br />4. Auroral Imagery<br />5. Auroral Energy Deposition<br />6. Auroral Particles<br />7. Energetic Ions<br />8. Electric Field<br />9. Medium Energy Particles<br />10. Geomagnetic Field<br />11. In-Situ Plasma Temperatures<br />12. In-Situ Plasma Fluctuations<br />13. Auroral Boundary</p>
<p>AFSPC top model/system effects product groupings are list below:</p>
<p>1. Ionospheric Parameters to Feed Physics-Based Ionospheric Models<br />2. Scintillation <br />3. Radar <br />4. Satellite</p>
<p>The Air Force is considering alternatives for acquiring space environmental data in support of the KPPs and KSAs. The system may include an orbital hardware follow-on concept, leveraging of planned programmed assets (both ground and space-based), and/or shared/purchased data and must address the operational data processing to ready the Sensor Data Records (SDR) and EDRs for deposition in an environmental database. Any system technology with a DoD TRL less than 7 (each component must have been demonstrated successfully on-orbit) shall not be included unless the company can show a path to flight worthiness via a Space Test Program launch or other means. We expect the most economic path to success for sensor measurements is available through hosting sensors on rides of opportunity.</p>
<p>The ground component must include any required software required to calculate appropriate engineering parameters for insertion into the Air Force Weather Agency's (AFWA) operational database. Any manipulation of the data beyond calculating SDRs and EDRs is not part of this effort; however, the contractors must understand the current and planned data processing algorithms beyond EDRs, global modeling, and system effects products.</p>
<p>We expect respondents to be challenged by selecting sensors and sensor suites to satisfy the KPPs while looking for avenues to satisfy KSAs and having the right data to drive models resulting in high quality system effects products. We expect a variety of options with pros, cons, risks, and discussion of trade space for the government to consider. Government investment of sensors on-orbit or planned that can fulfill requirements via alternative data processing is highly encouraged.</p>
<p>Command, control, and communications (C3) ground system trades may include maintaining/upgrading Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) or other legacy systems or commercial options. For planning purposes, anticipate a first launch availability of 1st quarter GFY 2015. Baseline spacecraft life should be 5 years with a probability of success greater than or equal to 70%. Other architectures are encouraged as long as they are cost effective and do not require increased system development. Though the baseline concept is outlined above for reference, respondents with a proven track record are encouraged to submit innovative alternatives that represent low risk and provide incremental improvements.</p>
<p>Responses should address the technologies available to deliver environmental data as described with supporting structures such as launch, spacecraft requirements and C3. The respondent should provide cost and schedule assumptions associated with each technology addressed. The Air Force is interested in separate cost and schedule estimates for each area. The cost estimate should also include software to process the satellite data stream into SDRs and EDRs at AFWA and ready them for deposition into an operational database.</p>
<p>The following assumptions should be used for cost and schedule estimation: <br />1. Cost/schedule estimate will be at 80% confidence level and responders may also include figures from various confidence levels if desired<br />2. Spacecraft/payload life should be 5 years with a probability of success greater than or equal to 70%<br />3. Solutions will be low risk by using TRL 7 or greater<br />4. IOC is 3rd quarter GFY 2015 with capability required through GFY 2020<br />5. 3rd quarter GFY 2010 contract award<br />6. Costs should be broken out to the lowest level possible - costs should be identified by individual EDRs and sensor<br />7. Include program level costs - Systems Engineering, Program Management, Integration, Assembly and Test Full-Time Equivalent support, etc<br />8. EDRs #1 and #2 must be satisfied, all other EDRs are optional, but highly desirable<br />9. Include software costs to process/prepare the satellite data stream for insertion into AFWA's operational database. Once AWFA has the data, no further effort is required.<br />10. Costs should be separated between development and production costs<br />11. Provide time-phased costs and detailed information on inflation rates used<br />12. Do not include award fee in cost estimate<br />13. Include discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations<br />14. Each solution's detailed cost estimate should be accompanied by a matrix-style summary spreadsheet showing how each option satisfies the EDRs and their respective costs - i.e. Option 1 has 2 sensors; sensor 1 satisfies EDRs 1 and 3 and costs $XX, sensor 2 satisfies EDR 2 and costs $XY, etc</p>
<p>Again, these assumptions are given for cost estimation and planning purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. !!</p>
<p>16e. SENSING CAPABILITY DESIRED TECHNICAL GOALS</p>
<p>The baseline requirement set is the current NPOESS IORD-II (available on request). This includes spacecraft collection and processing and transmission to proposed ground sites as well as Objective and Threshold performance requirements. !!</p>
<p>16f. SENSING CAPABILITY SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE</p>
<p>Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI. This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government. Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit.</p>
<p>Section 1 - Technological Alternatives</p>
<p>Briefly describe one or more technological alternatives, including the reliability, flight heritage and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives. (3-5 pages per alternative)</p>
<p>Section 2 - Feasibility Assessment</p>
<p>Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks. (1 page per alternative)</p>
<p>Section 3 - Cost and Schedule Estimates</p>
<p>Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is an 80% confidence estimate of cost and schedule risk to produce a cost effective system. These assumptions are given for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. (2-3 pages)</p>
<p>The assumptions in paragraph 16d may be used for cost and schedule estimation.</p>
<p>Section 4 - Corporate Expertise</p>

I. STATEMENT OF DUTIES

1.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

The Justice Advisor will work with the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan and the INL Bureau to create and implement U.S. foreign policy directives regarding the rebuilding of the justice sector in Afghanistan, focusing specifically on criminal justice and corrections.  

Background
INL manages justice programs in Afghanistan exceeding $100 million annually.  The management of a complex program of that size and importance to U.S. foreign policy goals requires someone with significant management and legal expertise to develop, monitor and troubleshoot all aspects of the program.

General Program Description
The INL Afghanistan Justice Advisor will provide advice and assistance to ensure the successful implementation of U.S. foreign assistance programs in Afghanistan. The justice advisor will be a member of the Embassy Special Committee on Rule of Law and will represent INLs justice programs to senior U.S., international and Afghan officials.  

INL is responsible for implementing U.S. foreign assistance programs designed to complement Afghan and international efforts to reestablish Afghanistans justice sector.  Program activities include institutional capacity building; professionalizing justice sector personnel through legal education and training initiatives; fostering coordination within the criminal justice system especially between police, prosecutors, courts and prisons; creating conditions in which Afghan Constitutional and international human rights guarantees can be upheld; and extending the formal justice system throughout the country while working with the traditional systems to increase public awareness and access to justice. 

To achieve these goals, the Justice Advisor must be able to effectively oversee three major contracted programs and possibly more in the future including (1) the Justice Sector Support Program (JSSP) with about 30 U.S. advisors, (2) the Corrections System Support Program (CSSP) with about 33 U.S. advisors, (3) the LL.M. program, a grant with the University of Washington School of Law to train about 20 Afghan law professors, and (4) the interagency agreement with the United States Institute of Peace to develop linkages between the formal and informal justice sectors.

The Justice Advisor will also be responsible for assisting and overseeing smaller grant programs and developing new initiatives in coordination with the Embassy and INL Washington.  The Justice Advisor will ensure that these programs are being effectively implemented, meet the needs and goals of the Afghan Government, are coordinated with the international community and NATO forces, and are briefed to senior U.S. Embassy and visiting officials.

The Justice Advisor will also ensure that INL Washington receives timely information and reporting to ensure that senior Department, Interagency and Budget briefings are fully informed of developments on the ground.  The Justice Advisor will work with in-country and Washington-based contract officer-designates in addition to working with the program office in Washington, DC.  However, the Justice Advisors direct chain of command is through the U.S. Embassy Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS).

	The position is full-time, with a minimum of 40 hours per week.

Travel
	Frequent travel is required to the areas within Afghanistan to coordinate and assist with the successful implementation of the programs cited above.

Entry level salary will normally be at the first step of the grade range for the position.

<DESC><p>The National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.5, with Coherent, Inc., for the purchase of two (2) VERDI V10 Water Riser Chiller: RoHS Compliant Lasers.
<p>Sole Source determination is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) requirements which can only be met by Coherent, Inc.'s lasers for the following specific power, low noise, and stability requirements: A) Power: &gt; 10W, B) Wavelength: 532nm, C) Noise: &lt;0.03% rms from 10Hz to 1GHz. This low-noise performance is required for us to pursue our research goals, D) Linewidth: &lt;5MHz, single longitudinal mode. The laser must deliver non-mode-hop, single-longitudinal-mode output; ie, linewidth must be under 5MHz. Note: systems based on a multi-axial design (MAD or QMAD) are not acceptable because of the mode-beating noise inherent in this design, E) Power Stability: +1% over 2 hours after a 15 minute warmup, F) Beam Pointing Stability: &lt; 5 &micro;rad/&deg;C, G) Single Frequency. Delivery 45 days after receipt of order.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a Purchase Order to Applera, LLC ( Formerly Known as Applied Biosystems, LLC) 850 Lincoln Center Drive, Foster City, California USA 94404-1128. A CDC Purchase Order will be issued to acquire reagents and other supplies to ensure the proper functioning of U.S. Government owned equipment. The U.S. Government owned equipment is further defined as the Applied Biosystems (ABI) 3130x1 genetic sequencers currently operated by the CDC, NCZVED Division of Vector-Borne Infections located in Fort Collins, Colorado. For a complete line item listing of supplies that will be procured from Applera LLC see the attached schedule. These commercial products are being procured using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13, to exclude FAR Subpart 13.5. The authority for this sole-source acquisition is FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b). Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the continued need to utilize the manufacturer's recommended expendable supplies to ensure the proper calibration and functioning of the referenced U.S. Government owned equipment. It is believed that a failure to utilize the manufacturer's recommended buffers, capillary arrays and various other expendable supplies will result in altered results generated by the genetic sequencers, which will ultimately hinder or halt the progress of on-going research / studies currently being conducted by the CDC. It is further believed that Applera (ABI) will not honor existing and current warranties for repair and replacement of damaged components if the recommended supplies, reagents and sequence buffers are not utilized to maintain the genetic sequencers during routine operations. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the Applera supplies, as listed in the attached schedule, are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer on or before 3:00PM / 1500 (Eastern Standard Time), April 16, 2009. Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses. Inquires may be sent to Russell T. Oxford by e-mail at roxford@CDC.gov or by fax to 770-488-2044.&nbsp;</p>

<SUBJECT>Proposed addition of Recycled Binders to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<SOLNBR>CP-09-04-07-01
<RESPDATE>042109
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Recycled Binders by the Federal Government. The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0877, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 1 inch Black</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0878, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 1.5 inch Black</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0879, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 2 inch Black</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0880, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 3 inch</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0881, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 1 inch Blue</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0882, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 1.5 inch Blue</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0883, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 2 inch Blue</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0884, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 3 inch Blue</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0885, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 1 inch Dark Green</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0886, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 1.5 inch Dark Green</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0887, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 2 inch Dark Green</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0888, Binder, 3 D-Ring, 100% recycled &amp; Recyclable, 3 inch Dark Green</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA/FSS OFC SUP CTR - PAPER PRODUCTS, New York NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Recycled Binders to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0877 - AVE-50000, STW 86011</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0878 - AVE-50004, STW 86021</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0879 - AVE-50008, STW 86031</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0880 - AVE-50012, STW 86051</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0881 - AVE-50001, STW 86012</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0882 - AVE-50005, STW 86022</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0883 - AVE-50009, STW 86032</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0884 - AVE-50013, STW 86052</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0885 - AVE-50002, STW 86014</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0886 - AVE-50006, STW 86024</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0887 - AVE-50010, STW 86034</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0888 - AVE-50014, STW 86054</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Recycled Binders to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 21, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">Pacific Star Communications. Inc. is located in the United States and can manufacture and support the PacStar 4100 to meet the requirement. It is in the best interest of the Government to purchase from this company since they manufacture a reliable SATCOM system.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">Another type of communication system available in the open market and GSA: </span>INMARSAT (INternational MARitime SATellite)<span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif';"> </span>works very well in flat, clear, and unobstructed terrain, not in mountainous/obstructed terrain with extreme weather in which we conduct our CST training.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>INMARSAT provides telephony and data services to users worldwide, via special terminals which communicate to ground stations through twelve <a title="Geosynchronous" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">geosynchronous</span></a> <a title="Telecommunications satellite" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_satellite"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">telecommunications satellites</span></a>. Inmarsat's network provides reliable communications services to a range of governments, aid agencies, media outlets and businesses with a need to communicate in remote regions or where there is no reliable <a title="Terrestrial" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">terrestrial</span></a> network.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If there are obstructions (to include sun travel see next paragraph) with the ground stations and satellites, communication can/will be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">INMARSAT SUN</span><em>-</em><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">CYCLE</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are short, predictable periods when earth-based INMARSAT receiving antennas will be required to look directly at the sun as it moves across the sky. During these periods the background noise increase dramatically, and all communication with the satellite is blocked. These solar cycles typically last for approximately 10 minutes and will occur for 3-4 days in a row. This phenomenon is due to the slow wobble or precession of the earth's rotation axis. This is the same wobble which accounts for the summer<em>/</em>winter seasonal changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>X.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Interested Sources</span></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></em>There were four sources who expressed interest in this acquisition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">We received a response from 308 Systems, Telecomm1stop LLC, Pacific Star Communications Inc., and CVG, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>308 Systems and CVG, Inc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>308 Systems: Provides the TRA-KIT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This system will not meet the government needs since the company is providing a computer, not the system.&nbsp; The system (as an upgrade) is using INMARSAT to achieve connectivity.&nbsp; Again, INMARSAT does not work well in mountainous regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Telecomm1stop: Was initially interested and then withdrew their interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Pacific Star Communications Inc.: manufactures the PacStar 4100.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CVG, Inc.: Offers the INMARSAT system and crypto option (extra option included that is very expensive and not required).</p>
<p><strong>XI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Steps to Foster Competition</span></strong></p>
<p>Contracting will continue to work with the customer to coordinate a competitive acquisition on all future requirements for these items. The circumstance is considered to be non-recurring.</p>

The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this procurement is 332994.  The primary point of contact for this notice is Bernice Barnes, 703-875-6098.

NOTE:  JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION   (1).  It is recommended that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of 81 COLT M4A1 rifles. (2).Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  It is required that the COLT M4A1 rifles be purchased to support the Agents assigned to critical missions.  This will enable DEAV to furnish Agents with the weapons they need to provide continued protection for personnel overseas.  Additionally, continued safe travel and protected movement is required for high level U.S. Embassy and Consulate officials while travelling overseas, and for Ambassador level officials serving in international organizations working to restore and maintain economic and social stability.  (3).	A description of the supplies or services required meeting the agencys needs.  The COLT  M4A1 rifles with detachable handles is the weapon that all agents are issued once they go through BSAC.  The M4A1 Carbine has been approved by the FPRB for issuance to all State Department personnel and contractors.  The Colt M4 is utilized all over the world as Diplomatic Security missions dictate, an unreliable, after-market magazine of dubious quality and functionality cannot be used.  (4).	An identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2).  The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-2, Sole Source Justification. (5) Demonstration that the proposed contractors unique Qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of  the authority cited.  Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has a broad range of responsibilities that include protection of personnel and facilities, both domestic and abroad.  Without the magazines and weapons requested, The Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide special agents the support that is required for continued and uninterrupted protection.  The COLT M4A1 rifles with detachable handles and magazines described in paragraph 3 are currently being utilized for the Karzai Protective Operation.
(6) Description of efforts made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as practical The magazine and weapon that has been requested are the same magazines and weapons that are issued to all of the existing agents currently in the field.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons and magazines to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.  (7).	Determination of the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  The M4 Carbine and magazine described above are to be utilized by Special Agents assigned to missions and posts overseas.  It is imperative that the agents receive the same equipment on this assignment that they are trained on, so when faced with an unsettled condition they are able to provide the protective services required.  The vendor states that this item has a lead-time of 90 days, but it is crucial that this be treated as Sole Source since the vendor supplies genuine Colt items.  DS has verified that the request as described represents the governments minimum requirements.
(8) A description of the market research conducted and the results or statement of the reason a market was not conducted.  (9) Any other facts supporting the use of Other than Full and Open Competition. Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has a broad range of responsibilities that include protection of personnel and facilities, both domestic and abroad.  Without the COLT weapon repair parts and tools requested, the Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide special agents the equipment they are trained on which is required for continued and uninterrupted protection.  The weapon repair parts and tools described in paragraph 3 are currently being utilized for the Karzai Protective Operation.
The weapons have been requested for the agents who were trained on the use of the M4 and the M203, and are given to all of the existing agents currently in the field.  The weapons and magazines requested are needed to equip the agents on what they will be expected to use once they arrive in Baghdad, Iraq.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents and DEAV armorers in the field including purchasing all new weapons to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.  The Bureau of Diplomatic Security has verified that the requirement as described meets the minimum requirements of the government.
(10) A listing of sources, if any, that expressed in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition of the supplies or services required.

DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: Work includes the provision of a refurbished NEC Electra Elite (KSU) Telephone System including all associated components.  Maintenance and Repair services to include: replacement of damage and/or defective parts and components, trouble shooting, reprogramming and replacement of nonfunctioning/defective equipment. 4.  AUTHORITY CITED: FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.	5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED: The Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits proposals. The NEC Electra Elite telephone system is the system used to provide  voice telephone service to all administrative staff located at the remote Tres Rios Office.  The system is already installed and operational. Due to system capability/compatibility to Interface with the VA Medical Center Telephone System (NEAX 2400); direct connection from Tres Rios extensions to VA extensions and vice versa is possible. This is one of the most important features of the system. It also allows Tres Rios staff to access long distance calls (FTS) through the VA Medical Center System avoiding high costs on commercial telephone lines. Failure to continue with the current telephone system company, will required construction services; due to the lack of space, the Government will have to remove the existing system, accommodate the new system and perform the required civil and electrical work. In addition, installation of a new system will take approximately three to four weeks. Consequently, a shut down of the entire telephone system at the 6th floor has to be performed. If the Government intends to continue operational with the existing system and install a new system the VA will have to do additional construction within the communication closet to accommodate the new telephone system so that the old one might  continue operational, this will not be cost effective to the station.  In addition, the VAMC IRM Service is in the process of change the analog telephone system to IP telephone system in all VA remote sites. Therefore, lease or purchase a new telephone system, at this time; will not be cost effective neither. NECOMM S&S Inc. is the contractor presently performing the telephone system lease, which includes the necessary maintenance and repair services to the system. Is the only responsible source with the expertise and available resources to perform this task during the required time frame. This action is the only cost effective way to continue with these critical services without interruption and without jeopardizing services provided to employees and patients until a new contract is awarded. Contractor is a Small Business.6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: This is a one time action. A new acquisition is planned for 3rd quarter FY 09. Service is developing new scope of work to conduct market survey and all other requirements to submit procurement package to the Procurement Business Division based on findings.7.  FAIR AND REASONABLE PRICE DETERMINATION: Estimated cost is $4,114.98.     Estimated cost is based on historical data and current costs.  A request for Proposal will be issued to the Contractor.  Contractors proposal will be evaluated against the estimated cost.  Negotiations will be held, if required, in order to reach a fair and reasonable price for both parties. 8.  MARKET RESERCH: A market survey was not conducted for this action since  Necomm    S & S,  Inc. is the only firm that can meet Government requirements within the time frame required as indicated in paragraph 5 above. 9.  OTHER FACTORS: None10.  INTERESTED SOURCES: No other sources can provide the services in accordance with the Government needs in the required time frame. Refer to paragraph 8.11.  ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION: Market driven. Refer to paragraph 6. 12. TECHNICAL CERTIFICATION: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.NAME:  Rafael Cosme                                        DATE: March 16, 2009TITLE:  IRM Telecommunications Manager       SIGNATURE: /S/13.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<DESC>The Library of Congress/FEDLINK requires accounting services to pay invoices for federal libraries who borrow from libraries that charge for lending materials.  Federal libraries that use this Interlibrary Loan (ILL) Payment Service will be participating in the Federal Library and Information Center Committee (FLICC) FEDLINK cooperative program and will establish accounts with LC/FEDLINK to pay for the charges they incur.  The ILL Payment Service vendor will pay the lending libraries certified invoices and will then bill the borrowing librarys LC/FEDLINK account for reimbursement for the amount paid to the lender and for a service fee.  The vendor will provide the borrowing library with detailed reports and summaries of lender invoices paid.  This service is designed for payments, not collections.  That is, the vendor is to pay institutions that photocopy, supply electronic documents, or lend materials from their collection to federal libraries; the vendor is not to collect from borrowers (individuals or institutions) fees that federal libraries themselves may charge when they photocopy, supply electronic documents or lend materials.  The FEDLINK ILL fee payment service provides an efficient method for federal libraries to pay ILL fees that may be charged by lending institutions to cover the cost of photocopying or other interlibrary loan processing costs. All proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the instruction provided in Section L of RFP LC10R7200.Vendors are responsible for ensuring that all amendments to the solicitation are received and addressed prior to proposal submission.  Please check this site periodically for amendments or clarifications to the RFP. All questions shall be submitted in writing and addressed to the Contract Specialist via email as specified.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  For information about the Library of Congress FEDLINK Program, please visit our website at: www.loc.gov/flicc. For additional information about other FEDLINK services, please contact Jim Oliver, FEDLINK Vendor Services Coordinator, via email at: joli@loc.gov.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format under Simplified Acquisition Procedures at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items; and FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NLM-09-081-SV. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect in the April 2009 Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis. This acquisition IS a 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519120, Libraries and Archives Services.</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine annually acquires over 2700 monographs in the foreign languages earmarked for this project, and it has an arrearage of over 1200 titles in these languages which the Cataloging Section is mandated to eliminate during the next fiscal year. NLM requires assistance in cataloging these monographs since it does not have the necessary resources or the language expertise to catalog them. <br /><br />Contracted cataloging assistance has been an essential activity for the last several years during which the Cataloging Section contracted for the cataloging of foreign language materials in order to meet its mandate of providing bibliographic control and for announcing the Library's acquisitions to the biomedical library community.</p>
<p>The vendor shall perform the following activities:</p>
<p>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine to negotiate with a library services vendor to provide professional services for cataloging 600-1200 Germanic and Romance Language materials. These materials will be a mix of French, German, Italian, and Dutch titles and require both copy and original cataloging. It is expected that approximately 20% of the titles will have copy and 80% will require original cataloging. It is also expected that between 1 and 10 items will be returned un-cataloged.</p>
<p>The services will include: 1) applying the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd Edition, 2002 revision (AACR2) and the Library of Congress Rule Interpretations (LCRIs) for descriptive cataloging and verification and creation of name/series access points in the NLM online authority file; 2) assigning NLM Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors; and 3) assigning class numbers to each monograph using the NLM Classification or the Library of Congress classification schemes. The task also entails completing the cataloging using NLM's integrated library system, Voyager, including adding and/or editing all NLM local fields following NLM procedures.</p>
<p><br />The purchase order period of performance will be for a 12-month Base Period of approximately June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010, with two successive 12-month Option Periods, on a Time-and-Materials basis [FAR 16.601]; at a not to exceed level of 1,920 labor hours per 12-month period.</p>

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government in technical factors, and price considered.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors are listed in order of importance.  When combined, non-price factors are more important than price. 

1)	Technical Conformance to Specifications
2)	Past Performance
3)	Price

Technical Conformance 

The technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the drawings. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating obtaining any information not identified in the offer. An offer that does not provide sufficient information which describes their capacity to meet the RFQs technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. 

Price

Proposals should identify any price reductions offered, or quantity discounts. All responsible sources may submit offers for quantities listed or quantity price breaks which shall be considered by the agency.

Past Performance

Offers shall provide at least two (2) references for recent and relevant contracts for the manufacturing of safety belts.  Reference information muust include contract numbers, points of contract names with telephone numbers and other relevant information.  For this factor the Government will evaluate information obtained from past performance information that the Government obtains about the offeror from these contacts or other sources.

(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

<DESC><p>2nd Set Vendor Questions - Dog Training Village<br /><br />1. On the exterior doors on the C shaped units, can they go on the inside of the C, centered on the 40 foot long units?
<p>Answer: We desire to have the doors on the 20 ft units in the center of the C.</p>
<p>2. Are the interior doors designed to egress from the 40 foot to the 10 foot to the 20 foot units? This way you can enter all the units through a door way.</p>
<p>Answer: Yes</p>
<p>3. Can the top hides have a door that drops down? This way it can be just like the floor hides with a pull up trap door. Are the dimensions for the hides a firm dimension?</p>
<p>Answer: These hide boxes are designed for explosive simulators. Therefore, we do not want a drop down for safety purposes.</p>
<p>4. Can the additional vents be located one in each corner of each corner?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>5. Can the vent be an 8" X 12" minimum?</p>
<p>Answer: Please make a proposal--we didn't specify size.</p>
<p>6. Regarding the landing at the top of the ladders; are you asking for railing around the second level to prevent a falling hazard?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, a railing is required.</p>
<p>7. What are the minimum roof and floor load capacity requirements?</p>
<p>Answer: There will be minimal load on the floors, so they should have a normal load capacity for these types of structures. The ceilings for the bottom of the two story units obviously need to support the upper floor.</p>
<p>8. Are shutters over non-glazed open tube steel framed windows acceptable?</p>
<p>Answer: No, windows are preferred to maintain our odor dissipation.</p>
<p>9. Are glazed windows required to operable or is glass fixed?</p>
<p>Answer: They should be operable.</p>
<p>10. Are drip edges required over windows and doors?</p>
<p>Answer: Not required.</p>
<p>In reference to Item 0001, 0003, 0004: Two Story Training Environments:</p>
<p>11. Is the 2nd story considered the roof deck of the first story or is it a second level of enclosed modules identical to the 1st story?</p>
<p>Answer: It is a second level.</p>
<p>12. Item descriptions allow for Interior ladders. Amendment Q&amp;A refer to Ladder way / stairway. Is either ladder or stairway considered acceptable solutions? Are wood or metal acceptable material solutions?</p>
<p>Answer: Either. There needs to be enough load capacity and slope to allow a human to carry a 70 to 90 pound dog on their shoulders up the stairs/ladder.</p>
<p>13. Assuming the answer to question 11. is confirmed to be an open roof deck and not a fully enclosed second story then will safety railing and sufficient roof load capacity satisfy "safety measures"?</p>
<p>Answer: It is enclosed.</p>
<p>14. Assuming the answer to question 11. is confirmed as an enclosed second story then what safety measures would be necessary? Wouldn't the entire second story floor be considered the landing?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. The 2nd story floor should have the same load capacity as the first.</p>
<p>15. Assuming vendor capable of delivery by 30 April 2009 (21 days from today) when is an award expected to be made? 10 Apr 09, delivery of materials should start on 24 Apr 09</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

Answers to questions will be posted on Tuesday, April 14, 2009.
Solicitation will close on Tuesday, April 21, 2009 @ 3:30 pm.

This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as Request for Proposal (RFP) # NLRB-PAR-2009, when responding to this notice.  This is a total Small Business Set Aside; NAICS Code: 541430, Small Business Size Standard: $7.0 million.  This RFP will result in the award of a Firm Fixed Price contract for design, layout, and editing of the National Labor Relations Boards, Performance and Accountability Report.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-31, effective March 19, 2009.

GENERAL INFORMATION

A.  Introduction

The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and the Accountability for Tax Dollars Act of 2002 require that the NLRB prepare an annual Performance and Accountability Report (PAR).  The audience for this publication is the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Congress, other federal agencies, and the public.

The NLRB requires contractor assistance in preparing this publication in the form of design, layout, and editing.

B.  Background

The PAR follows form and content guidance prescribed in OMB Circular A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements.  It is due to OMB and Congress by November 15 of each year.  The intent of the PAR is to provide an accurate depiction of the Agency's performance in meeting its strategic goals, and to present its year-end financial statements as of September 30th, and the results of an accompanying audit. 

To prepare the PAR, the NLRB's Director of Administration works with representatives of the NLRB's program offices to develop narrative text, tables, and graphics.  Microsoft Office templates (primarily Microsoft Word) are distributed to program staff.  This initiates the collection and assembly of the PAR.

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) Firm-Fixed Priced (FFP) contract for maintenance dredging to the Shinnecock Inlet located off the south shore of Long Island (approximately 95 miles by water from Battery, New York). This project consists of furnishing all plant, labor, materials and equipment. This effort involves dredging to a depth of 20 feet, plus 2 feet allowable over depth, along with the removal of approximately 440,500 cubic yards of shoal material. The dredged material is to be placed on the shoreline approximately 6,500 to 8,400 feet west of the site by an ocean going hydraulic dredge. Performance of all work must be in strict accordance with the specifications and drawings. The selected contractor will be required to diligently commence work within 5 calendar days and complete the work no later than 90 calendar days after receipt of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). The time stated for completion includes final cleanup of the premises. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about&nbsp;7&nbsp;APR 2009 with bid opening on/about&nbsp;7&nbsp;MAY 2009.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: TITLE: F-15 Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Modernization Program   This Notice of Contractual Action is a Pre-Solicitation Notice in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.201 and 5.203(a).  The 912th AESG - F-15 Systems Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio plans to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) FA8634-08-R-2650 for the Electronic Systems Test Set (ESTS) Obsolescence Program.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The anticipated RFP release date is March 14, 2008.  The F-15 ESTS Modernization Program is an Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) program. The F-15 ESTS is an Intermediate  level support equipment system providing maintenance & repair for approximately 50 F-15 Line Replaceable Units (LRU). The system consists of a station, Interface Test Adapters (ITA), ancillary equipment, and associated cables located at all F-15 operating locations and the depot at Robins as well as Northrop-Grumman, Rolling Meadows, Ill. The station (62 units) itself will become increasingly difficult to maintain and ultimately unsustainable beginning in FY09 unless known obsolescence for a variety of component parts is not addressed.  The overarching program objective is to avoid stations becoming Not Mission Capable (NMC).  The program will accomplish this by replacing instruments contained within the station that are projected to be obsolete over the next several years.  The Air Force does not have program authority to replace or redesign the ESTS station.  The planned funding profile is as follows: FY09 - $13.11M, FY10 - $10.88M, FY11 - $15.86M.  Interested parties may view and/or download the full RFP by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  The ESTS Bidders Library has been posted to the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) Website @https://www.fedteds.gov/ which provides a direct link to the RFP in FedBizOpps.  All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.  Foreign participation is not permitted at the prime contractor level.  Address issues, concerns, and questions regarding this acquisition to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Barry Foster; E-Mail barry.foster@wpafb.af.mil.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  You may refer them to the Ombudsman if, after discussing them with the Contracting Officer, you feel that you are not effectively communicating with the government. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. The ASC Ombudsman is Karen Emery, ASC/CS, 1865 4th Street, Bldg 14, Room 203, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 (Phone: 937-255-6356; E- Mail karen.emery@wpafb.af.mil). Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  NOTE:  For all ESTS Modernization Program documents posted to date, please reference the PIXS location entitled ESTS Modernization Program.  All documents posted from this date forward, please reference Solicitation FA8634-08-R-2650.

<DESC><p>Additional Information:<br />It is estimated that 1320 hours of aircraft flight time, 2416 hours of<br />certified flight instructor time, and 980 hours of flight surgeon/pilot time<br />will be required to satisfy this effort. The number of aircraft, flight<br />instructors, and flight surgeon/pilots required to meet this contractual<br />obligation will increase with each successive element. The initial<br />requirement will be for a maximum of two aircraft and two flight<br />instructors. This will increase to a maximum of three aircraft and three<br />flight instructors. The last increments will require enough aircraft and<br />instructors to fly a minimum of 10 sorties per day and two flight surgeon<br />pilots and then increase again to require enough aircraft and instructors to<br />fly 20 sorties per day and two or three flight surgeon pilots.<br />Implementation is scheduled to begin NLT 14 September 2009. It is expected<br />that this activity will mature into an ongoing flight training requirement<br />at USAFSAM that could require as much as 5800 hours of flight training<br />annually and that will migrate to Dayton, Ohio with the School in 2011
<p>Insurance limits are not known at this time.</p>
<p>All training must be accomplished in accordance with USAF, AFMC, and FAA<br />regulations and requirements.</p>
<p>Fuel will not be available from military sources.</p>
<p>The Government would consider tandem seating but prefers side-by-side<br />seating for the type of training that will be conducted. The USAF's Initial<br />Flight Screening program uses side-by-side cockpits.</p>
<p>Late responses will&nbsp;be accepted. &nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to 1) provide a status update on the Missile Defense Agency Engineering and Support Services (MiDAESS) acquisition, and 2) provide a proposed RFP Section H clause for Limitations on Subcontracting (applicable to RFP HQ0147-09-R-0001).

The government is preparing responses to numerous questions submitted after release of the draft RFPs and subsequent Industry Days in February 2009.  Responses are projected for release during April 2009.  The government is processing approximately 170 letters resulting from the formal Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) meetings.  The Agency has released 50 letters and others will be released during the next few weeks, as industry partners submit their additional data to complete the reviews.  It is anticipated the MDA will complete all OCI assessments and release the letters during April 2009.  The final RFPs are projected to be released during May 2009.

As a result of numerous questions relative to the small business set aside draft RFP (HQ0147-09-R-0001) and the application of Limitations on Subcontracting (referred to as the 50% rule), the clause below will be included in Section H of the RFP and resultant contracts.  This clause is provided for your information.

                      ********************************************************** 

H-__   Compliance with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting (referred to as the 50% rule).  

a.   The period of time used to determine compliance with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will be the base contract period, including all task orders issued under the contract.  Small business contractors do not have to comply with the 50% rule on each task order.  

b.  In accordance with 13 CFR Section 125.6(i), if the contractor is a joint venture and meets the following requirements, compliance with the 50% rule will apply to the cooperative effort of the joint venture, not its individual members:

1.  The joint venture contractor is exempt from affiliation under 13 CFR Section 121.103(h)(3); and,

2.  The joint venture contractor qualifies as a small business concern.

c.   Pursuant to 13 CFR Section 121.103(h), a joint venture may or may not be in the form of a separate legal entity.  

END OF CLAUSE

<DESC><p>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, intends to solicit for a HVAC construction project that shall include, but not limited to the conversion and retrofitting of eight (8) buildings from a central, high pressure steam generation and distribution system into a hot water heating distribution system at the Department of Veterans Affairs Aleda E. Lutz Medical Center Campus in Saginaw, Michigan. The work will include construction of three new hot water boiler plants (total minimum output approximately 24,000 MBH) around the campus to re-feed eight buildings with heating hot water instead of high pressure system. The main boiler plant will consist of the construction of a 2 story brick masonry building (approximately 5000 square feet in size) with a basement and would be supported by a structural steel frame. The second and third boiler plant locations will be within the basements of two existing buildings. In addition, the project requires demolition of existing distribution lines and equipment in the existing boiler plant. The work will be completed in phases in order to maintain heating service to all buildings and minimize disruptions of hospital operations throughout the construction process. The estimated construction cost is more than $10,000,000.00. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 238220. The small business size standard for this requirement is $14 Million in average annual receipts over the past three years.<br /><br />The solicitation is anticipated to be available on or about 27 April 2009. To download the solicitation, visit www.fbo.gov. In order for interested contractors to conduct business with the Federal Government, contractors must register their firm at the Central Contract Registration (CCR).
