STATEMENT OF WORK ? GENERAL:  Since its inception the Border Patrol has utilized horses in support of the mission to which it is assigned.  Certain minimum requirements have been established and the successful contractor/seller is expected to comply with the established parameters when supplying horses for service mounts. 

REQUIREMENTS: Breeds- Quarter Horses are the desired breed. Crossbreeds may be accepted on a case-by-case basis, as determined by the government.

Horses will be subjected to high desert/low desert; mountainous terrain; loose rocks; thick brush; extremely hot temperatures in the summer and drastically cool winters. A certified Border Patrol Instructor and the Coordinator or a designee for the Tucson Sector will administer a series of tests to determine whether the horse has the capability of working in the Border Patrol environment. Each horse will be required to pass these tests for acceptance into the program. 

SELECTION EXERCISES/TESTS: A candidate horse must be sound and well proportioned in conformation. The horse shall be gentle and calm with a good disposition. Following are a series of tests that the agents will conduct to determine whether or not a horse will meet the minimum requirements for purchase. Approach- When approached, the horse should turn and face, standing quietly, especially in a confined area. Halter- The horse should be easily haltered without giving any indications of head-shyness or resistance to ?catching?. Leading- The candidate horse should exhibit good ground manners and should remain calm when being handled. Saddling- The candidate horse should stand still and calm while being saddled. He should show no signs of aggressiveness of being ?cinchy? during this process. Mounting- The candidate horse should stand still and calm during this evolution.

Excessive force should not be necessary during this process. Dismounting- The candidate horse should stand quietly while the rider dismounts. Loading/Unloading- The candidate horse should load and unload from a variety of trailers without difficulty. Balking will be a disqualifying factor when considering the purchase of a candidate horse. Shoeing- The candidate horse should stand quietly and calmly while being shod or having his feet worked on. 

TEMPERAMENT: All candidate horses should exhibit the ?proper temperament? during the entire selection process. The candidate horse should be calm when any number of people or equipment are moving or standing around him.

The candidate horse must possess a gentle and calm demeanor during the hours of darkness and around large groups of people. 

DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED: Current vaccination/Quarantine records. Health certificate issued by a certified/licensed veterinarian. Registration certificates, breed surveys and other related paperwork, as applicable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A certified veterinarian will perform a full physical examination of the candidate horse as a prerequisite to completing the selection process. 

MISCELLANEOUS: The Government retains the right to return a candidate horse to the contractor/seller, if after 45 days, the animal is deemed not suitable for service. This determination will be based on the selection criteria or the horse is discovered to have a pre-existing medical problem, chronic disease or a hereditary defect that could render the horse unsuitable for service. The vendor will replace the horse within thirty days of receipt of notice that any of the aforementioned conditions exist. This animal shall be replaced with a suitable horse that meets all the selection criteria.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC), National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease (NCIRD), Division of Viral Diseases (DVD) intends to issue RFQ 2007-Q-09772 on/or about 25 Jul 2007 to obtain quotes from interested contractors to generate monoclonal antibodies to the mumps virus.  These antibodies will be used to develop various diagnostic tests for mumps.  Balb/C mice will be used in the performance of this project. The outbreak of mumps in 2006 highlighted the critical need to develop new diagnostic tests for mumps, particularly in the development of rapid serological assays to assess disease status and immunity from infection.  At present the number of monoclonal antibodies to mumps virus is extremely limited and in many cases the quantities of these reagents are restricted because the hybridoma cell lines are not viable or are unavailable.  When issued, the RFQ with the full statement of work can be accessed through the internet at http://www.fbo.gov.  Any amendments issued to the RFQ will also be made available at the same website.  It is the Contractor?s responsibility to keep up with additional posting regarding this pre-solicitation notice on the FedBizOpps (FBO) website.  If you are a small business of any category and are interested in submitting a quotation for this procurement it is requested that you make your interest as well as your small business size qualifications for NAICS code 621511 known to the Contract Specialist at fyq8@cdc.gov no later than 24 Jul 2007.  If at least two (2) quotes from small businesses can be expected to be received, this procurement will be issued as a set-aside for small business.  Otherwise, quotations will be sought under full and open competition.

<SUBJECT>B -- Hearing Protector Testing
<SOLNBR>2007-Q-09779
<RESPDATE>081007
<ARCHDATE>08252007
<CONTACT>Jennifer Bayer, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513)533-8586, Fax (513)533-8283, Email jmh8@cdc.gov - Dwight Favors, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Phone (513)533-8137, Fax (513)533-8283, Email dyf3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has a requirment for hearing protector testing as follows:
BACKGROUND
When engineering controls have not eliminated hazardous workplace noises, workers must rely on hearing protection devices (HPDs) to reduce noise exposures to within safe levels.  Unfortunately, the attenuation provided by an HPD as it is actually worn by a worker is often only a fraction of the potential attenuation that the HPD can provide.  Many factors influence how much attenuation a given HPD will provide. One of the key factors involves how a worker is trained to wear his/her hearing protector.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES
This effort has two objectives:
1.	Determine the relative effectiveness of video training vs. the written instructions which accompany hearing protectors. 
2.	Determine the relative effectiveness of Experimenter Supervised Fit compared to the fit obtained by na?ve subjects using either video or written instructions.

NIOSH wishes to determine the attenuation provided by four different earplugs: EAR Classic, Moldex PuraFit, Howard Leight Fusion (two sizes) and Howard Leight AirSoft (two sizes).  The Classic and PuraFit are formable earplugs and Fusion and AirSoft are pre-molded earplugs.  The plugs have been selected based upon prior existing datasets that can be used to evaluate a variety of research questions. NIOSH will provide the specific earplugs to the vendor upon award of the purchase order.

The American national Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard S12.6-1997 (R2002) Methods for Measuring the Real-Ear Attenuation of Hearing Protectors shall be used to determine HPD attenuation.  Each earplug will be used in two separate series of attenuation tests:
1.	(a) video instructions provided by NIOSH on a data DVD using Quicktime, MPEG or Windows Media formats, (b) written instructions provided by the manufacturer, and (c) experimenter supervised fit.
2.	(a) written instructions provided by the manufacturer, (b) video instructions provided by NIOSH, and (c) experimenter supervised fit.
The only difference between condition 1 and 2 is the order of presentation of the video and written training materials.  In both conditions, tests involving video or written training shall employ na?ve subjects in accordance with Method B of ANSI S12.6.  Tests using an Experimenter Supervised Fit shall meet the conditions specified in Method A of ANSI S12.6.  

Given that the above conditions will be followed for each of the four earplugs to be tested, a total of 160 na?ve subjects will be required (20 subjects, 2 initial instruction conditions, and 4 ear plugs).

Given also that there are three fitting conditions, two orders of testing, and four earplugs, a total of 24 sets of REAT trials shall be completed for this entire requirement.

DELIVERABLES/REPORTING SCHEDULE:

1.	The contractor shall provide a report of test results for each hearing protector and test condition.  This report shall include the following measurements:
a.	Subject age, gender.
b.	Audiometric air-conducted hearing thresholds in decibels (dB HL) estimated to a 1-dB tolerance.
c.	Measurement of ear canal size (right and left ears).
d.	Training thresholds for unoccluded sound field audiograms in dB SPL for 5 repetitions per ANSI S12.6-1997.
e.	Ambient background noise levels for the test chamber in dB SPL per ANSI S12.6-1997 in octave bands 31.5-16,000 Hz at the beginning and end of the testing for all protectors.
f.	Unoccluded and Occluded sound field audiograms in dB SPL for all subjects and products for the frequencies 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 Hz for the product(s) and conditions in which the subjects were tested.  Subject number, Device, Test Condition (occluded/unoccluded) and Training Condition (Written, Video or Experimenter Supervised).
g.	Individual Attenuations for each pair of occluded and unoccluded thresholds.

REPORTING SCHEDULE:
Within 60 days following completion of data collection, a final report shall be completed using Microsoft Word.  Microsoft Excel shall be used to report tabular data. Additional software may be used to report data subject to approval by the project officer.  A hard copy and an electronic copy of all reports shall be submitted to the NIOSH Project Officer.  The file(s) for the electronic reports shall be submitted on a compact disk (CD).  
MINIMUM CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS:

IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED FOR AWARD OF A PURCHASE ORDER, CONTRACTORS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT DOCUMENTATION WITH THEIR QUALIFICATIONS.  AWARD OF A PURCHASE ORDER SHALL BE MADE TO THE LOWEST QUOTATION THAT MEETS THE GOVERNMENT?S MINIMUM CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS AS FOLLOWS:

1.	The contractor must provide evidence that they have academic training and experience necessary to conduct scientifically valid and reliable REAT measurements on human tests subjects.  Examples of academic fields which would meet this requirement include (but are not limited to): audiology, hearing science, mechanical engineering, acoustical engineering, experimental psychology, and physics.  Experience may be demonstrated by describing the number of years and number of hearing protector tests he/she has personally performed/supervised.  The quality of this experience may be demonstrated by describing publications resulting from this work.

2.	The contractor must provide evidence that they have appropriate laboratory facilities for conducting hearing protector attenuation tests.  This shall be demonstrated by having the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Standards Services Division, National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), certify that the test facilities and procedures meet those specified in ANSI S12.6 1997 (R 2002) Methods for Measuring the Real-Ear Attenuation of Hearing Protectors.

3.	The contractor shall describe the process by which test subjects will be recruited. The contractor shall demonstrate his/her ability to recruit the necessary number of test subjects in order to complete all required attenuation measurements within four months following award of the purchase order.

Request for Quotations number RFQ 2007-Q-09779 shall be available and posted to this announcement on or about July 31, 2007.  Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit a response to Request for quotations number 2007-Q-09779.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is soliciting proposals for the National Guidelines and Quality Measures Clearinghouses from offerors who have the capability to migrate, operate, maintain, enhance, and evaluate two existing yet related AHRQ Internet repositories of evidence-based information and associated companion materials These are: the National Guideline Clearinghouse (TM) (NGC), www.guideline.gov, for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines; and the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse(TM) (NQMC), www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov, for evidence-based quality measures and measure sets. These Web resources have a database-backend, are indexed and searchable, and adhere to Health on the Net (HON) code ethics. Relationships between the two databases and Web sites that have already been established will be maintained. For this solicitation, each repository will retain its unique URL and name.

Content in NGC and NQMC is presented in a standardized format using a template of attributes specific to each Clearinghouse. This format permits side-by-side comparison of database content online. All guidelines in NGC and all quality measures in NQMC meet specific inclusion criteria. NGC has two additional content items: syntheses and Annotated Bibliographies. NQMC has browse features not available in NGC.  NGC has search features not available in NQMC. This requirement is content driven supported by information technology.  While there are information technology components in the requirement, it is not IT driven. Content on both the NGC and NQMC must be evaluated against evidence-based practice standards separate and apart from IT standards.

The goal of these two Clearinghouses is to provide physicians, nurses, and other health professionals, health care providers, health plans, integrated delivery systems, purchasers and others an accessible mechanism for obtaining objective, detailed information on clinical practice guidelines and quality measures and to further their dissemination, implementation and use in order to inform health care decisions.

This requirement will develop, deploy and maintain the processes and systems to collect, abstract, index, publish, update and archive clinical practice guidelines and quality measures. Implementation or evaluation tools associated with the submitted guidelines or measures will be identified and shared as potential content with AHRQ?s QualityTools Contractor. The guidelines and measures will be evaluated, extracted, entered and stored in a database; they will be posted to the existing Web sites. 

Early in this requirement?s life cycle, the Contractor will make recommendations to AHRQ on enhancements to each Web site (content, functionality, design), and following a systems development life cycle and configuration management plan, conduct usability tests, and through an iterative process refine the enhancements, test, eventually deploy, operate, maintain and assess customer satisfaction. 

Related content tasks include establishing a single expert panel and a single editorial board with capacity to offer guidance to both projects, propose revisions to the established content inclusion criteria and templates of attributes. The expert panel will guide the Clearinghouses on broad project areas, and will participate in approval of revisions to the inclusion criteria and standardized template. 

The Editorial Board will work with the content teams in key aspects of content development and production, such as, but not limited to, reviewing submissions against the inclusion criteria and judging how new or emerging knowledge in the clinical practice guideline and quality measurement fields could be acted upon.  The Editorial Board will also serve to assist in the development of recommendations on what information to seek from submitters in an online submission form (not currently available) and on how to enhance the user?s experience with the content currently posted, fill content gaps, and manage posting of user comments to the Web site, including responses from relevant guideline or measure developer organizations much like that done for scientific journals. 

The Web sites shall continue to be user-centered and meet requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002, including ensuring information quality, following Department of Health and Human Services -wide policies, communicating with the public and following the Paperwork Reduction Act, using the approved domains, implementing security controls, protecting privacy, maintaining accessibility, and managing records and documentation. 

Proposals must  demonstrate expertise in developing, appraising, implementing and using evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and quality measures; developing or evaluating and integrating informatics in efforts related to health services research, clinical practice guidelines or quality measures; expertise in indexing using the National Library of Medicine?s Unified Medical Language System; complex database and government Web-site development and maintenance; and, managing and working with expert panels and editorial boards. In addition, Sources must demonstrate expertise in developing and managing complex content driven projects under tight timelines.  

Proposals must demonstrate personnel are seasoned professionals with education and proven experience with successful results in areas such as development, implementation, use, and evaluation of clinical practice guidelines and quality measures; development of clinically related classifications schemes and use of National Library of Medicine?s Unified Medical Language system; working with developers of clinical practice guidelines and quality measure, as well as, clinical organizations, including but not limited to hospitals, health plans, and medical specialty societies; completing highly technical and complex projects; migrating and constructing large relational databases; migrating and developing user-friendly Government Web sites. A  PMI?certified or PMI-certification-eligible Project Manager is required as well as a demonstrated ability to provide EVM information.  
 
It is anticipated that the procurement will be on a cost reimbursable basis for a six-year period of performance (three year base with one three-year option).  For information purposes, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable is 516110 Internet Publishing and Broadcasting (500 people).  The successful offeror will comply with the DHHS/ AHRQ small business subcontracting goals set forth in the Request for Proposal.

In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ?s site at www.ahrq.gov   Once in AHRQ?s homepage go to ?Funding Opportunities?, then to ?Contracts?, and then to ?Request for Proposal (RFP)?.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to modify an existing contract on a sole source basis and is not a request for proposals.  The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) intends to modify contract number DE-AC52-04NA25472 with Aon Risk Services, Inc. to obtain immediate, reimbursable emergency payments in the form of liability coverage to potentially injured parties as a result of NNSA Office of Secure Transportation or Nevada Site Office aircraft operation. This coverage will include coverage to third parties, including passengers and crew, baggage (including declared values), personal effects liability, and cargo liability (including declared values).  Usual areas of operation are continental USA but occasional foreign travel is possible.  The minimum liabilities to be provided are:  Combined Single Limit Bodily Injury, Property Damage, and Passenger Legal Liability in the amount of $100,000,000.00 (U.S.) any one aircraft/occurrence.  Extended Coverage Endorsement (Aviation Liabilities) provides a minimum sub-limit of $50,000,000.00 (U.S.) any one occurrence and in the annual aggregate, except in respect of passengers to whom the full policy limit shall apply excess of a deductible of $100,000,000.00 (U.S.) each and every occurrence. NNSA intends to modify the contract because solicitation number DE-RQ52-07NA28015 published on May 21, 2007 did not produce any small business firms capable of providing the insurance coverage.  Therefore, the existing contract will be extended for one year to permit NNSA ample time to revise its acquisition strategy to competitively obtain the coverage.  THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE-SOURCE AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed commercial item contract modification based upon lack of responses to the earlier notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This is an intent to award notice, therefore proposals cannot be submitted directly on this notice.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to inform the vendor community of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) proposed contract action.  DISA intends to award sole-source to Alterpoint, Inc., who is the direct manufacturer of the Network Authority 6 software. The following is the approved justification and approval for use of other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)1

This synopsis will close on Tuesday, July 24, 2007 at 11:00am EST.

Nature/Description of Actions:  The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Systems Center requires Alterpoint?s Network Authority 6 software which is a solution that enables DISANet Administrator to efficiently manage the configurations of Network Devices such as switches, routers, firewalls, and others.  Network Authority 6 is the only solution for network governance.  Network Governance is an advanced approach to managing modern enterprise networks that focuses on business alignment and goes well beyond the basic, proprietary tools that focus solely on inventory and change automation.  DISA has identified governance as the catalyst for achieving standardization and reducing risk, but there has been a gap between best practice concepts and how to run a network.  Alterpoint?s Device Authority upgrade to Network Authority 6 is to bridge this gap by providing the open network model and analytics to meet DISA?s needs to optimize network spend while institutionalizing the adaptability for tomorrow?s requirements.

Alterpoint is the direct manufacturer of the software Network Authority 6, formerly Device Authority, which is now a family of four products that provide automated analytics, compliance management, asset management, and network vulnerability management.  DISA has requested Alterpoint to provide adapter work to support CyberGurad Firewalls for Alterpoint?s Network Authority version 6.0.  In addition, DISA has requested professional services to upgrade two systems to the most current version of Network Authority and training/knowledge transfer to DISA.  All adapter work and training in this situation can only be provided by Alterpoint.  The code specific to matching the adapters with the technology is proprietary and therefore there are no authorized companies outside of Alterpoint that would have the capabilities to perform said request as well as the training associated with it.  The specific professional services for the upgrades can only be performed by trained individuals with experience in the upgrade process.  The work was requested by DISA and specifically with Alterpoint professional services due to the criticality of the services to the overall DISA mission.

These services ensure modifications on firewalls are carried out efficiently with minimal risk.  Network downtime is attributed to human error, and the DISANet Control Center currently has no ability to correlate outages with configuration changes to DISANet Firewalls.  This product is extremely critical to solving these problems.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has a requirement for research and development support services that includes hardware and software system engineering, system analysis, component specification, and data collection and analysis. The contractor shall provide support in a variety of electronic warfare disciplines and related applications. This effort will focus on 
system research and development, software development (real-time digital signal processing, real time displays, and graphical user interface), radio frequency engineering and fabrication, assembly, integration and the testing of prototype electronic warfare systems. General design and development support (e.g. schematics, design documentation, user and operator manuals) and program management support will be required. The unique nature of this research requires access to NRL hardware, classified computing resources, and databases dictating that a major portion of the labor tasks be performed on-site at NRL.  A detailed statement of work will be issued with the solicitation. The Government anticipates an award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) term type contract. Access to classified information is not required for the purpose of submitting a proposal for this statement of work. However, prior to award of contract, the successful contractor will be required to have a Secret facility clearance, Secret storage capabilities, and personnel available with DoD granted personnel security clearances commensurate with level of access required for performance of contract. The anticipated period of performance is a basic award of twelve months with four 12-month options, if exercised.  The anticipated level of effort is 19,890 for the basic contract and 19,890 for each option, if exercised. The NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency. See Numbered Note(s) 1, 26

A phase-locked microwave source operation at 264 gigahertz (GHz) is needed for the construction of a novel apparatus for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments.
This microwave source will be used with two existing superconducting magnets already located at the NIDDK.  Therefore the microwave source must provide power at the proper electron spin resonance frequency of these magnets, which is 264 GHz.

The 264 GHz source technical requirements are as follows:

1.  The source must operate at a frequency of 264 GHz, with the ability to be tuned over at least 1.4 GHz range in tuning steps of 50 MHz or less
2.  The long-term and short-term frequency stability of the source must be 50 MHz or better
3.  The microwave output power must be at least 20 milliwatts at 264 GHz.  Lower output powers will not produce the required DNP signal enhancements
4.  The source must operate from 120 V AC line power.  All power supplies and other necessary components for production of the specified microwave output must be included, with the exception of digital programming of the frequency setting.
5.  The microwave output flange of the source must be compatible with attachment to WR-4.3 rectangular microwave waveguide.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for 1(EA) Pulsed Dye Laser and associated hardware. This laser is an upgrade to an existing  YAG laser's frequency doubling unit.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Spectra Physics, as the only known source who can meet the Agency's needs. The proposed dye laser was designed to operate with Spectra Physics Nd:YAG lasers and is sold by Spectra Physics.  If another vendor's laser is used additional optics may be required to move and reshape the input laser beams, resulting in losses and reduced performance, as well as increased cost to the Government.  Spectra Physics is the original manufacturer of the YAG lasers which are compatible with the existing dye lasers.        The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 27, 2007.

<DESC>The overall goal of this solicitation is to foster new developments in Science and Technology which may ultimately lead to future operational capabilities beyond those represented by current acquisition programs and requirements.  As such, it is anticipated that successful proposals would ultimately contribute to the scientific and technological underpinning from which future Marine Corps and Combating Terrorism warfighting requirements and capabilities may become possible.  By necessity, the Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development efforts are extremely technically diverse.  As such, efforts are divided into six Thrust Areas each representing operational functions critical to Expeditionary Warfare.  Brief descriptions of ongoing efforts within the Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare thrust areas are posted at http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/30/.  Other references describing concepts for Marine Corps future warfighting include MC Strategy 21, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare Capability List, Science & Technology Strategic Plan, and Distributed Operations that can be found at https://www.mccdc.usmc.mil/.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and under the authority of FAR 13.1, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued under Request for Quote RFQ-DC-07-00258 and includes incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-17. The  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334516 with a Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of 500 employees. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this purchase order is for the Contractor to provide (2) of the required detector systems intended for  general purpose liquid scintillation counting of samples in two separate fixed laboratories at different geographic locations somewhere within the United States or its territories.  Each laboratory will receive one detector system, consisting of a detector, associated electronics, and a computer  system.  STATEMENT OF WORK: Separate quotations are requested for Item 1 (detector and electronics), Item 2 (computer system), and for combinations of Items 1 and 2.  Separate contracts may be awarded for Items 1 and 2 if it is determined that this will provide the greatest value to the government.   The specific locations where the equipment is to be shipped and installed have not yet been determined.  EPA will perform receipt inspection at the vendor's facilities when manufacture is complete.  The inspection may be performed in conjunction with the factory testing by the vendor, at the  vendor's discretion.  This inspection by EPA will include verifying the functionality and interoperability of all components being provided by the vendor, and therefore must be performed with the equipment fully assembled and prior to packaging.  The vendor will be responsible for packaging the  equipment for temporary storage and/or shipment after the equipment is accepted by EPA.  The vendor may invoice EPA for 90% of the agreed amount for Items 1 and 2 after they have been accepted by EPA.  The remaining 10% will be invoiced by the vendor and paid by EPA after satisfactory completion of  the on site installation and start up services specified in General Requirement 3.  For both equipment items, separate fixed price quotations are requested for temporary storage (Items 3 and 4). If EPA has not yet determined the final locations for the equipment at the time of receipt inspection,  the vendor will be required to provide temporary storage of the equipment for up to 6 months.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541618   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Scientific Consulting Group (SCG) to provide technical support services for the U.S. EPA Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) Program for the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National  Risk Management Research Center (NRMRL.  The NAICS code is 541618. Based on the EPA's knowledge of technical support needed for the Statement of Work (SOW),  SCG has developed an Internet-based database for the EPA, which is used  to collect and report ETV information.  The database is comprised of two parts, a back-end used to store data and an Internet-based front-end to allow users to input and edit data.  The code used to develop the ETV internet-based database was written by SCG, with input from the EPA regarding data  needs and desired functionality. The resulting database is a unique product and is not amenable to "off-the-shelf" modifications or maintenance by programmers lacking extensive familiarity with the database, its design, and the nuances of the code used to achieve the desired functionality.  The  circumstances of SCG's unique familiarity with the ETV database, its customized nature, and its current location (housed on SCG's server) preclude the possibility that another contractor could reasonably perform this requirement.	  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting the EPA's  requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement, based upon responses  to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541618.  Please submit your  request in writing to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No telephone requests will be honored.

All software must be Year 2000 and Section 508 Accessibility Compliant with Sections: 1194.21, 1194.25 and 1194.26.  The standard does not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology device, but merely requires that the EIT be compatible with such software and devices so that it can be made accessible if so required by the agency in the future.  The Government many request additional information from the Contractor to determine product compliance. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS -- 1. COMBINATION GAS AND LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPH - The laboratory requires a combination Gas and Liquid Chromatograph to analyze gas and aqueous environmental samples collected as part of broader experimental and monitoring programs. Because we will be analyzing compounds that may be suitable for either GC or LC analysis, the instrument must have the capability to be adapted to LC/MS analysis via interchangeable sources in the laboratory without any special assistance from the Contractor.  This ensures that no matter what the analysis, we can arrange the instrument to the configuration needed.  The reconfiguration of the system must be straight forward and achievable by laboratory personnel. Any system requiring the reconfiguration by manufacturer?s contractors only is unacceptable given the inconvenience, time and expense. The dual interface arrangement also minimizes bench space usage and alleviates the need to purchase two mass spectrometers, one for GC analyses and one for LC. The Gas Chromatograph oven must be capable of central control of up to 7 heated zones (6 plus column oven), with temperatures of -99 to 450o C to provide greatest flexibility in analyses (i.e., measurement of broad range of compounds). The oven must be capable of rapid column oven cool-down (450o C to 50 C in < 5 minutes) to enable rapid sample analysis. In order to provide for the greatest flexibility in analyses and ensure determination of a broad range of compounds, the Liquid Chromatograph should have a flow rate range from 10 uL to 100 mL/min. To ensure high flow accuracy and reproducibility of results, the Liquid Chromatograph should have a flow accuracy of +/-1% of selected flow rate or +/-0.05% of maximum flow and a flow reproducibility of +/-0.1% of selected flow rate or +/-0.005% of maximum flow.  To allow for flexible sample sizes, the Liquid Chromatograph AutoSampler should be able to utilize standard or deep well 96 well plates, 384 well plates, PCR plates, or 48 2.0 mL vials. It should also have a variable sample fill speed for viscous samples. 2. TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETER - A primary application of the Gas and Liquid Chromatograph is to determine concentrations of pharmaceutically active compounds in environmental samples. Therefore, the detector for the Gas Chromatograph/Liquid Chromatograph must be a tandem Mass Spectrometer (MSMS). 3. TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETER SPECIFICATIONS - The Mass Spectrometer must have a mass range of 1500 amu for detection of large molecules via GC/MSMS and those compounds amenable to LC/MSMS analysis.  In order to receive the most complete information regarding sample composition in undesirable matrices, the instrument is required to either possess a triple quadrupole analyzer or allow an upgrade to a triple quadrupole analyzer in the laboratory.  This will allow for MS/MS analyses of low-level analytes in dirty matrices such as the water, soil, and tissue samples we expect to encounter. The Mass Spectrometer must incorporate a triple quadrapole mass analyzer with pre and post filters as part of all quadrapoles and feature a lensless analyzer design to minimize the potential for blending of peaks thereby improving peak separation and allowing maximum transmission of ions.  For the same reason, the Mass Spectrometer should have a 180 degree curved path collision cell for high dissociation efficiency and the elimination of neutral noise which can adversely affect sensitivity. Due to the wide range of compounds and media that will be analyzed, the Mass Spectrometer must be capable of electron ionization (EI) and positive and negative chemical ionization (PCI and NCI). Due to the wide range of compounds and low detection limits necessary for pharmaceutically active compounds, the Mass Spectrometer modes must include full scan, selected ion monitoring (SIM), both precursor and product scans, neutral loss scan, and both single and multiple reaction monitoring. 4. COMPUTER REQUIREMENTS -- a)  Flat Panel LCD Display, 19-inch, Dell; 1280 x 1280 x 1024 resolution; 0.294 mm dot pitch; 800:1 contrast ratio; 250 cd/m2 brightness; 15-pin D-sub analog; 4 USB 2.0 ports.  b) Computer - Dell Optiplex GX-620 3.4 GHz Pentium 4 Minitower with: 3.4 GHz Pentium P4 Processor 650; 800 MHz Front Side Bus; 2 MB L2 Cache; 1.0GB (2 x 512 MB) DDR2 SDRAM @ 533 MHz (filling 2 of 4 slots); Integrated AGP video with Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950 (up to 224MB shared memory); Integrated 10/100/1000BaseT Ethernet NIC; Integrated sound card and chassis mounted speaker; 160 GB, SATA II, 7200 rpm Hard Drive with 8 MB buffer; 16X DVD+/-RW Drive with Sonic software; 16X DVD Drive with Cyberlink Power DVD software; 1.44 MB floppy drive; 4 PCI full height slots (2 standard PCI, 1 PCIe x16 graphics, 1 PCIe x1); 1 serial port; 1 parallel port; RJ-45 network port; 8 USB 2.0 ports (2 in front, 6 on rear panel); USB keyboard & USB 2-button optical mouse w/ scroll (no PS/2 connectors); Windows XP Professional SP2 Operating System.  5. ISO CONFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS- The Contractor must provide proof of conformance to ISO9001 standards for both hardware and software development. A certificate or statement must be provided as proof. Compliance to ISO9002 alone is not satisfactory, as this does not cover product development functions. SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS - The USDA, ARS, Pasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit (PSWMRU) has determined that Varian Inc's. GC/LC Tandem MS system the only equipment with the following salient characteristics: 1. The Varian system is the only known system that may be switched between gas the liquid chromatography by USDA personnel, rather than requiring a factory technician service call.  The nature of our research requires us to do frequent, same-day changes. 2. Varian is the only vendor that incorporates a 180 degree collision cell for optimum efficient dissociation in MSMS experiments and it also eliminates neutrals in the system from striking the detector by placing the detector off-axis from the ion source.  Some compounds of interest may be detected at lower levels in negative ion mode by LC/MS.  Because of the curved collision cell the detector can be placed directly behind the third quadrupole allowing ions to strike the detector directly for increased ion signal. 3. SYSTEM FOOTPRINT:  The entire system must fit into a footprint not greater than 10 feet long by 3 feet wide and must fit on a standard laboratory bench top. The 180 degree arrangement of the collision cell also gives the Varian instrument a smaller footprint instrument saving valuable lab bench space.  Location of equipment:  1st floor, PSWMRU Water Quality Laboratory (Penn State University). 4. The Liquid Chromatography component of the Gas Chromatograph/Liquid Chromatograph Tandem Mass Spectrometer is easily removed from the mass spectrometer in order to be interfaced with the Varian 730-ES ICP-OES system owned by Penn State's Agricultural Analytical Services Laboratory to enable LC/ICP-OES analysis.  5.  We are currently engaged in joint research efforts with Pennsylvania State University?s Agricultural Analytical Services Laboratory to analyze Rare Earth Elements (i.e., lanthanide series) and trace metal speciation of diverse environmental samples.  In order to meet future analytical needs, the Liquid Chromatography component of the Gas Chromatograph/Liquid Chromatograph Tandem Mass Spectrometer must be able to be easily removed from the mass spectrometer in order to be interfaced with the Varian 730-ES ICP-OES system that is owned by Penn State's Agricultural Analytical Services Laboratory to enable LC/ICP-OES analyses, and with a Varian 730-ES ICP-OES system that we intend to purchase separately. This will extend our capability to analyze Rare Earth Elements (i.e., lanthanide series) and/or to perform trace metal speciation of samples, neither of which is possible at the present time. PACKING AND SHIPPING - The Contractor shall pack each item for shipment in a new container in such a manner that will ensure acceptance by common carrier and safe delivery at the destination.

BACKGROUND
NIST operates three beamline laboratories at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) located at the DOE's Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The OMNIAX Translator described herein will be mounted permanently at our U7A beamline as part of second beamline endstation.  This OMNIAX Translator (ultra high vacuum 4 axis; X,Y, Z, and theta) is fully compatible with two other OMNIAX Translators previously purchased and in routine use at NIST  NSLS beamlines U7A and X24A. 

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for compatibility and interchangeability with existing beamline OMINAX translators currently in the laboratory.  This equipment will be used at a remote site (NSLS) in 24/7 operation located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, rapid interchangeability with existing equipment (between beamlines) is very important in order to maintain a high level of up time, imperative to the success of NIST research.  Unique compatibility with NIST custom made existing software and sample-holder hardware which has been designed to work with these OMNIAX translators is required.  VG Scienta, Incorporated, is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required manipulator.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by August 1, 2007 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Biochemical Science Division, within the Advanced Chemical Science Laboratory, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 USC 253 (c)(1), with  Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc. (CBI) of Richmond, VA,  for materials acquisition for production of a DNA Sequence Library Standard Reference Material (SRM) .  
 
This requirement is a follow-on to work completed under competitively awarded purchase order number SB1341-06-N-1397.   Work under this requirement will support a standards development project with the DNA Microarray Community, as it is represented in the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC).  The ERCC is performing a collaborative study to identify suitable elements from a library of controls.  The previously awarded purchase order enabled NIST to supply materials for this study.
The solicitation which preceeded purchase order number SB1341-06-N-1397 referenced the requirement for follow-on work.  This project is that follow-on work.

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.  
	(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly 
specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in?
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays fulfilling the agency?s requirements.
    (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B)

Commwealth Biotechnologies, Inc. is uniquely qualified to complete this follow-on project.  CBI successfully completed work under the previously stated purchase order.  As such, they have developed a technical work process for transcribing RNA from the DNA library, which NIST intends to adopt as a use-process for this standard reference material (SRM).  Continuity of design and development for this work process is essential for the highest quality materials.  CBI is the only vendor who has this unique knowledge and can ensure continuity.  

In addition, to work with an alternate vendor would cause the Government to incur additional costs estimated at $20,000.00 for packaging and shipping of product, transfer and validation of materials, and validation of work processes.  This work has been completed by CBI under the current purchase order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333999, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by July 31, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Introduction This is a Request for Information (RFI) for potential sources to provide product offerings and information to VHA to help formulate options and strategies for selecting a decision support system designed to facilitate standardization of business processes for requesting, reviewing and approving the acquisition of capital assets.  Vendors should provide basic information regarding offerings and capabilities as to how they would approach the VHA to achieve this document's outlined objectives below.  Agency Name:  Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency Overview:   The VHA is one of three organizations (the other two being the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and National Cemetery Administration (NCA)) within the Veterans Administrations (VA).   The VHA is made of 21 integrated health care service networks (VISNs) that include 157 medical centers throughout the 50 states.   Capital assets include equipment (medical and non-medical) and real property, both of which are acquired in a variety of ways by local medical centers and networks that oversee their operation. Project Name:   National Portfolio Management System (NPfMS) Project Project Background:   Currently within VA/VHA, the acquisition (which include request, review and approval) of high-dollar capital assets - over $500,000 (including equipment and fixed/real assets) is centralized in the Capital Investment Program (CIP) and managed centrally/nationally via the CIP portfolio management system &amp; database.   The CIP portfolio management system is a web-based decision support tool that automates the request/review/approval process and which enables objective scoring and prioritization or equipment requirements.   Acquisitions over $500k typically must be reviewed and approved nationally before local purchases can be executed.   Within each network and medical center, a variety of local business processes, review/approval thresholds and business/data systems are used to execute the capital equipment request, review and approval process.   To date, there is no standardized business process or system to manage capital equipment requests, reviews and approvals across all medical centers and networks. Project Details:   Before an integrated business process/system solution can be developed or implemented, it is essential that VHA conduct a current state assessment of its existing business processes and systems with regards to capital asset acquisitions.   The NPfMS Project represents the initial phase in conducting that assessment and is comprised of three major components: 1.	Current state assessment of business processes, 2.	Marketplace assessment of decision support systems for acquisition of capital assets (including portfolio management systems), 3.	Stakeholder assessment to evaluate key VHA stakeholders in the capital asset request, review and approval process.    This RFI is designed to identify and provide basic information is support of Item 2. above. Based on the results of the current state assessment of business processes, stakeholder assessment, and responses to the RFI, a comprehensive assessment will be completed which will include recommendations for possible development of a standardized business process/system for managing the request, review and approval process for capital assets (i.e., an integrated portfolio management system) across all medical centers and networks.   Should a decision to move forward with an integrated process/system solution be established, a Request for Proposal (RFP) may be issued.   Should that RFP be issued, it will contain more detailed requirements for the product, contractual details, and key criteria for successful bidders. The marketplace assessment of decision support systems for acquisition of capital assets (including portfolio management systems) includes the following core categories: 1.	Strategic Alignment 2.	Process &amp; Metrics 3.	Investment Domains and Portfolios 4.	Reporting and Analytics 5.	Communication &amp; Collaboration 6.	User Interfaces 7.	Architecture, Security &amp; Cost 8.	Investment Optimization Each of these categories contains a number of specific questions that address an array of anticipated functional and operational requirements.   The specific questions are listed in the Requirements Section below. REQUIREMENTS Business background of the project:   To evaluate the feasibility of developing and deploying an integrated solution (business process and systems) that standardizes the capital asset request, review and approval process within VHA. The core categories of the marketplace assessment are provided immediately below.   Within each of these categories is a series of questions designed to obtain additional information regarding vendor offerings.   Vendor offerings should address each of the categories and associated questions therein.   Additional information associated with each category (but which may beyond the scope of the specific questions therein) should be incorporated into the vendor's response.   The vendor may also submit product information outside of the categories listed below, as well as a capability statement (which may include information such as staff expertise, consulting experience, IT systems experience, etc.). Core Categories/Requirements (Section 1-9): 1.	Strategic Alignment 2.	Process &amp; Metrics 3.	Investment Domains and Portfolios 4.	Reporting and Analytics 5.	Communication &amp; Collaboration 6.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SOLNBR>AHRQ-07-10005
<RESPDATE>032807
<CONTACT>Mary Haines, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 427-1786, Fax 301 427-1740, Email mary.haines@ahrq.hhs.gov - Mary Haines, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 427-1786, Fax 301 427-1740, Email mary.haines@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is soliciting proposals for the National Guidelines and Quality Measures Clearinghouses from offerors who have the capability to migrate, operate, maintain, enhance, and evaluate two existing yet related AHRQ Internet repositories of evidence-based information and associated companion materials These are: the National Guideline Clearinghouse (TM) (NGC), www.guideline.gov, for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines; and the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse(TM) (NQMC), www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov, for evidence-based quality measures and measure sets. These Web resources have a database-backend, are indexed and searchable, and adhere to Health on the Net (HON) code ethics. Relationships between the two databases and Web sites that have already been established will be maintained. For this solicitation, each repository will retain its unique URL and name.

Content in NGC and NQMC is presented in a standardized format using a template of attributes specific to each Clearinghouse. This format permits side-by-side comparison of database content online. All guidelines in NGC and all quality measures in NQMC meet specific inclusion criteria. NGC has two additional content items: syntheses and Annotated Bibliographies. NQMC has browse features not available in NGC.  NGC has search features not available in NQMC. This requirement is content driven supported by information technology.  While there are information technology components in the requirement, it is not IT driven. Content on both the NGC and NQMC must be evaluated against evidence-based practice standards separate and apart from IT standards.

The goal of these two Clearinghouses is to provide physicians, nurses, and other health professionals, health care providers, health plans, integrated delivery systems, purchasers and others an accessible mechanism for obtaining objective, detailed information on clinical practice guidelines and quality measures and to further their dissemination, implementation and use in order to inform health care decisions.

This requirement will develop, deploy and maintain the processes and systems to collect, abstract, index, publish, update and archive clinical practice guidelines and quality measures. Implementation or evaluation tools associated with the submitted guidelines or measures will be identified and shared as potential content with AHRQ?s QualityTools Contractor. The guidelines and measures will be evaluated, extracted, entered and stored in a database; they will be posted to the existing Web sites. 

Early in this requirement?s life cycle, the Contractor will make recommendations to AHRQ on enhancements to each Web site (content, functionality, design), and following a systems development life cycle and configuration management plan, conduct usability tests, and through an iterative process refine the enhancements, test, eventually deploy, operate, maintain and assess customer satisfaction. 

Related content tasks include establishing a single expert panel and a single editorial board with capacity to offer guidance to both projects, propose revisions to the established content inclusion criteria and templates of attributes. The expert panel will guide the Clearinghouses on broad project areas, and will participate in approval of revisions to the inclusion criteria and standardized template. 

The Editorial Board will work with the content teams in key aspects of content development and production, such as, but not limited to, reviewing submissions against the inclusion criteria and judging how new or emerging knowledge in the clinical practice guideline and quality measurement fields could be acted upon.  The Editorial Board will also serve to assist in the development of recommendations on what information to seek from submitters in an online submission form (not currently available) and on how to enhance the user?s experience with the content currently posted, fill content gaps, and manage posting of user comments to the Web site, including responses from relevant guideline or measure developer organizations much like that done for scientific journals. 

The Web sites shall continue to be user-centered and meet requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002, including ensuring information quality, following Department of Health and Human Services -wide policies, communicating with the public and following the Paperwork Reduction Act, using the approved domains, implementing security controls, protecting privacy, maintaining accessibility, and managing records and documentation. 

Proposals must  demonstrate expertise in developing, appraising, implementing and using evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and quality measures; developing or evaluating and integrating informatics in efforts related to health services research, clinical practice guidelines or quality measures; expertise in indexing using the National Library of Medicine?s Unified Medical Language System; complex database and government Web-site development and maintenance; and, managing and working with expert panels and editorial boards. In addition, Sources must demonstrate expertise in developing and managing complex content driven projects under tight timelines.  

Proposals must demonstrate personnel are seasoned professionals with education and proven experience with successful results in areas such as development, implementation, use, and evaluation of clinical practice guidelines and quality measures; development of clinically related classifications schemes and use of National Library of Medicine?s Unified Medical Language system; working with developers of clinical practice guidelines and quality measure, as well as, clinical organizations, including but not limited to hospitals, health plans, and medical specialty societies; completing highly technical and complex projects; migrating and constructing large relational databases; migrating and developing user-friendly Government Web sites. A  PMI?certified or PMI-certification-eligible Project Manager is required as well as a demonstrated ability to provide EVM information.  
 
It is anticipated that the procurement will be on a cost reimbursable basis for a six-year period of performance (three year base with one three-year option).  For information purposes, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable is 516110 Internet Publishing and Broadcasting (500 people).  The successful offeror will comply with the DHHS/ AHRQ small business subcontracting goals set forth in the Request for Proposal.

In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ?s site at www.ahrq.gov   Once in AHRQ?s homepage go to ?Funding Opportunities?, then to ?Contracts?, and then to ?Request for Proposal (RFP)?.

<DESC>Background:


The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) ensures ready access to essential evidence that documents the rights of citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience. NARA supports lifecycle management of records in all three branches of the Federal Government and provides sustained access to historically valuable records in the National Archives and the Presidential Libraries.  Among these records are the Decennial Population (and Housing) Censuses, created by the Bureau of the Census, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.



The objective of this Request for Information/Sources Sought Notice (RFI) is to determine whether any non-profit or for-profit entities are interested in forming a partnership with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to provide electronic access to the records of the 1940 Decennial Census of Population and Housing in 2012, and under what terms such a partnership might be established.  The nature of this partnership is described below.  The Decennial Population Census has been taken every 10 years since 1790 by the Bureau of the Census.  Under Title 13, United States Code, these records are restricted from public disclosure, except for aggregated statistical data without personal identifiers, until such a time as the individual privacy rights of those identified in the census forms, known as schedules, have expired.  The date when the information can be released to the public has been determined to be 72 years from the date of the Census.



NARA has a statutory obligation not only to make these records available but also to sell complete copies of the 1940 census.  In previous releases of decennial census records, copies of microfilm rolls containing the census records were sold by NARA.  Along with the Census schedules are so-called Soundex rolls that served as an index to some of the schedules.  There are Soundex rolls for the 1880 through 1920 Censuses, and a partial Soundex for the 1930 Census.  There is no Soundex for the 1940 and later Censuses. In recent years, private for-profit companies have purchased the Census microfilm from NARA and digitized the microfilm to make it available to researchers using the Internet, along with other Federal and non-Federal records and databases of genealogical interest.  The public has now come to expect that such records are readily available and searchable by name via the Internet.  In accordance with NARA's Strategic Plan, NARA plans to make available digital copies of the census records.  


Goal 4 of the strategic Plan states: 


We will provide prompt, easy, and secure access to our holdings anywhere, anytime; and  
NARA has identified 2 applicable strategies to achieve this goal. 
A. For the broadest possible access, we will make digital copies of selected non-electronic records available online.  We will identify these holdings in a digitization plan that sets priorities for putting these holdings online. 
B. We will work to establish partnerships with both governmental and private institutions to facilitate the availability of NARA holdings over the Internet, in accordance with appropriate Government laws, regulations, policy, and guidance. 


The strategic plan also contains specific language that addresses digitization.  It says that NARA will work to digitize selected records, including those most requested by researchers, and will put searchable descriptions of all our holdings online with clear information about the archival context of the original records and how they may be located and used. 


The strategic plan is available online at: http://www.archives.gov/about/plans-reports/strategic-plan/.

Description
Request for Information (RFI) for the 1940 Decennial Population Census Digital Reformatting and Access Project


The following information describes the scope of the project:


Original Records: 4,643 rolls of 35mm microfilm
Existing Index: None.  A name index must be created.


Records Security: Access to records is restricted by Title 13, USC.  All handling of records must follow Census Bureau's security requirements and procedures.  These requirements include having every person with access to Census information swear in writing (Special Sworn Status) that they will never release any information on the Census to anyone else until the date of official public release (see below).
Limits on Indexing: If name index is done prior to release date, it must be done within the US.


Release Date: April 2, 2012


Type of Re-formatting: Digitization, 8-bit gray scale, to be by NARA staff.


NARA plans to digitize the records in-house using NARA staff.  This is for both cost and security reasons.  NARA will also prepare the electronic equivalent of roll lists, which more broadly identify the records by State and County or City.  Currently we have made no decisions about creating or purchasing other finding aids such as those we made available for the 1930 Census, such as color reproductions of enumeration district (ED) maps or city directories.


NARA is looking for a partner to create a searchable name index to the microfilm in exchange for the right to fulfill orders for segments of the index and the right to charge a reasonable subscription fee to institutions and individuals for access to the index.  Access to the digitized records will remain free.  The number and type of data fields or elements to be captured by the index must be addressed in the response to the RFI.  The estimated cost of producing the index must be included as part of any response to the RFI.


Access to the records and the complete index will be provided free of charge at NARA'S Archives I facility in Washington, DC, and at all of the NARA regional archives facilities where Census microfilm is available.  These regional facilities are located in Waltham, MA (suburban Boston); Pittsfield, MA; New York City; Philadelphia; Morrow, GA (suburban Atlanta); Chicago, IL; Kansas City, MO; Ft. Worth, TX; Denver, CO; Seattle, WA; San Bruno, CA (suburban San Francisco); Laguna Niguel, CA (Orange Co., CA); and Anchorage, AK.  Under the terms of any agreement, NARA will not permit the copying of any part of the index while using NARA'S website or at NARA location during the period of the agreement but will expect that its patrons will be permitted free access and print capability during their visit.  The digital images of the Census will be available for free on the Internet to all users but it is understood that without the index, the images themselves are of very limited research value.


NARA is interested in recouping its costs to digitize the microfilm and therefore will expect that a royalty fee will be paid by the concessionaire based on the gross revenue of sales of partial indexes and copies of the images on DVD or other hard electronic media.


This RFI is the first step that NARA plans to take to solicit input and interest from the vendor community and to promote competition in response to the forthcoming solicitation. 


Response Instructions 


NARA requests that responses are submitted in Microsoft Word format or if necessary, other products from the Microsoft Suite.  Briefly describe your company or institution, your products, past and current projects, and current services, history, ownership, financial information, the number of employees, and other information you deem relevant.  Please provide points of contact, including name, address, phone/fax number, and email.  You are encouraged to provide comments on the 1940 Population Census Re-formatting and Access Project approach.  Respond only if you can provide the total solution to this project.  Discuss technically feasible alternatives and provide non-binding order of magnitude cost and schedule estimates. Indicate whether your solution or product is commercially available or is on the General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule.  Supplemental product brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications and capabilities may also be submitted.  Furthermore, please include substantive responses to the following:


1) Understanding that indexing cannot be conducted outside the United States and that anyone with access to any part of the Census before its public release date must have Special Sworn Status: a) what work processes will you employ to create a name index and (b) how would you ensure that the Census Bureau's security requirements are met while the records are in your custody?


2) Do you believe there will be a market for copies of or access to partial indexes by State or other geographic subdivision, and why?  What is your strategy for tapping into that market?


3) If granted a "concession" to be the exclusive distributor of copies of the 1940 Census to the public, how many years do you anticipate having a need for the concession?  Explain why you need the concession for that period of time.


4) In order to re-coup its expenses, NARA anticipates charging a royalty as part of the "concession" agreement.  Do you provide royalties to other archives or libraries and how are they determined?


5) Discuss the potential data storage requirements for this project and your capacity to both store and provide public access via the Internet.


6) Provide feedback on our requirements.  Specifically provide comments on any requirements that you believe cannot be implemented.  Describe how you would organize the requirements so that both NARA and your company or organization can make the 1940 Census publicly available at a reasonable cost and still receive sufficient compensation to offset the cost of providing the records digitally.


7) Identify possible constraints or potential risks.


8) What tools and metrics do you use to measure system performance?


9) Describe your IT security program.


10) Describe the type of contractual agreement and pricing structure that you envision.


11) Describe your disaster recovery program.


12) Would your firm or organization be interested in giving an informational presentation to the NARA?


Contact Information


Please submit responses via email not later than 4:00 PM on 08/17/2007 to paul.premoe@nara.gov.  The subject of the email should be "1940 Census RFI Response".

<SOLNBR>DADA09-09-07-T9008
<RESPDATE>080807
<ARCHDATE>10072007
<CONTACT>kevin.w.hill1, 210-292-3270
<DESC>Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, 011-49-6221-172109, marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil A. General Information.   The Europe Region (TRBO Europe), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 55 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Conventional Needles and Syringes.   The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination for conventional needles and syringes that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the be st possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, via USAMMCE.   The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik , 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U.  S. CENTCOM.   This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAP A) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow the Prime Vendor to distribute their items. This is a supplement to t he Prime Vendor Program, and not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.   The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is August 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria with pricing being least important.  A multiple award is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region.     Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, 011-49-6221-172109, marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil.   B.	Products & Performance Required.   The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Conventional Needles and Syringes.  The estimated total annual volume for this product line in the Europe Region is $322,329. This is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month p eriod.   At the request of the Europe Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide product support to sites if requested, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS informa tion, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.   C.	Instructions to Offerors.   DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received prio r to the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  All interested offerors are to provide electronic e-mail responses.  This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, for providing complete product literature at no charge for  clinical evaluation purposes, and for submitting electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Region Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) POC above that its initial submission, literature, and quote actually arrived at the Europe Region TRBO.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmissions before the due date/time should a  problem occur with the first submission.  As stated above, vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadlines will be disqualified.   D.	 Source Selection Procedures.   The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this  initiative. Phase I:  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability.  All te chnical/company criteria are weighted equally.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those qualified vendors who met the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  Phase II:  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.   The CPT determined a literature review evaluation process would be used and will request literature review material for this product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilit ies.  Vendors are required to ship literature to the Europe TRBO.  Vendors will be given 10 business days to ship the literature review material.  Literature review material must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 5:00PM EST on the 10th business day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  Vendors must forward a verification of shipment to the TRBO. Designated MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale of one to five rating.  One is equal to not acceptable; two is equal to minimally acceptable; three is equal to acceptable; four is equal to most acceptable; five is equal  to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The CPT has established a 3.00 clinical acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.00 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  Phase III:  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the technical/company and clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 clinical threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on a committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region.  Qualifying vendors will be given ten (10) business days to provide the TRBO their pricing proposals by email in a prescribed format.  Vendors fail ing to provide their pricing proposals by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the offers become more technically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated bas ed on best value to the government.  Pricing proposals are to be founded on a committed volume for a two-year base period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   1.	Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation.   The CPT will review the fol lowing technical/company criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria:  Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business conce rn offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Owens & Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region; and 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoters information provided is factually correct .  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.   Technical/Company Information:   1.	What brand(s) and styles are manufactured and/or distributed for Conventional Needles and Syringes?   2.	Does your company have a local vendor representative in the Europe Region?  If yes, please provide contact information; name, telephone, and e-mail.    3.	What types of educational tools or materials are available for Conventional Needles and Syringes?   4.

<CONTACT>Ronnie Bierner 760.725.3914
<DESC>The following is a Request for Information (RFI).  This RFI is for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Quotations or Proposals.  Responses to this RFI cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The purpose of this RFI is to provide an opportunity for industry comment, identify potentially interested sources, and to identify potential problems and receive alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of any future procurement for these services.  The government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual challenge areas associated with this initiative.   Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed, but as an opportunity to im!  prove an eventual solicitation package.  Comments are solicited regarding the following:  1. The Regional Contracting Office-SW is considering a no cost contract (or contracts) for the removal and disposal of recyclable kitchen grease.  The scope would require periodic emptying of contractor provided grease barrels with secondary spill containers for approximately 16 buildings.  Kitchen grease removal does not include any confined space entry.  With the recent popularity of bio-diesel, the Government believes there may be interest in utilizing the grease for this purpose.  Camp Pendleton is a large facility, covering nearly 200 square miles.  The dining facilities/mess-halls where the grease would be picked-up are scattered throughout the base.  Review by and input from potential sources is requested.  Replies are requested to address, at a minimum, the following:  a)  What is the minimum monthly quantity that would be required to make this a viable no-cost contract? b)  Is!   there a maximum that potential sources can process due to regulation  or capacity limitations?  c)  Is there a specific quality limitation that is needed to utilize the grease for the intended purpose?  d)  Are there any industry-specific terms and conditions that the Government should consider. e)  Are there any special permits or insurance requirements imposed by state or local regulations?

FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. MARKET SURVEY  SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane), is currently seeking potential sources for a Weapon Shot Counter (WSC) compatible with the Special Forces Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) family of weapons.  The WSC is a module or weapon component that will enable weapons maintenance personnel to easily determine the number of rounds fired through a weapon barrel, and possibly other conditional parameters such as firing cadence and barrel temperature that indicate remaining service life of critical components.  The WSC will be provided with a Data Collection Device (DCD), which will be used to download WSC data.  Unknown technology may preclude the need for a DCD and will be taken into consideration.  To fulfill immediate need, NSWC Crane is seeking a WSC that is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) item.  With limited information being released about SCAR, it is understood that some configuration change to a COTS WSC may be required.  Shock simulation data will be pro!  vided to assist in a configuration change.  Limited resources will be supplied by NSWC Crane to make the COTS WSC compatible with the SCAR family of weapons.  Favorable consideration will be given to technology that can detect change of barrel automatically or by simple user input.  DCDs that require no software installation on a PC will also be given favorable consideration.  Cost will be a consideration as well.          All vendors with an appropriate product relating to the requirements set forth in this Sources Sought are invited to submit a Capability Statement and contact information.  The Capability Statement should discuss the products capabilities against the potential requirements, the products system requirements, and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance the understanding of the information submitted.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) located in Saint Petersburg, FL, intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for the development of a population model for threatened Elkhorn Coral (Acropora Palmata), to be utilized by the SESFC on a sole source basis from Tali Vardi, La Jolla, CA based on the following:  1) Tali Vardi, a PhD candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, has been developing this model for the past two years through funding made available through the Scripps Institute; 2) Vardi has the network of colleagues and advisors with the necessary expertise to develop the required population model and has been partnering with researchers at the SESFC who have collected the necessary data needed to support the on-going model development; 3) Tali Vardi is the only known source that has begun the development of such a model that successfully meets the requirement SESFC currently has; 4) The preliminary model is the intellectual property of Tali Vardi and therefore is not available from another source at this time; 5) For consistency and to prevent the loss of the progress that has already been made it is necessary to continue utilizing the partnership with Vardi and the SESFC to ensure successful completion of the Vardi model.

Project Overview

Caribbean acroporids have undergone a 97% decline in regional abundance since the 1970s, resulting in a ?Threatened? status under the Endangered Species Act.  NMFS needs a population model that will enable them to choose recovery strategies for Acropora Palmata based on quantitative, defensible guidelines.  The Contractor will c create a matrix model using data collected by NOAA?s SESFC on change in A. palamata size through time in Key Largo.  The model will enable the estimation of key life history parameters such as rate of change in population size and expected time to extinction.  Upon assessing the rate of change in population size the Contractor will conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the relative importance of various life history parameters (e.g. size and density of individuals) in affecting population growth.  Second, the Contractor will create comparable models for populations of A. palmate in other locations in the Caribbean that are faring differently than those in Key Largo.  (e.g. recruiting in Jamaica, and exhibiting stability in Curacao).  Armed with models for three different types of populations and their respective parameters, the Contractor will be able to recommend the most appropriate recovery strategies for each type (e.g. planting young corals in populations that are recruitment-limited, and protecting older corals where recruitment is apparent.  Ultimely, the model will be extrapolated to Acropora cervicornis and used to (1) prioritize the management of various risk factors according to their effects on A. palmate and A. cervicornis populations; and (2) elucidate appropriate spatial and temporal scales for restoration, providing NOAA Fisheries and the public with realistic expectations for recovery.  In short, such a model will help direct precious conservation dollars to populations that have a chance of persisting into the future.

Period of Performance:  October 1, 2007 through March 31, 2009.
Place of Performance:  Contractor?s facility

Objectives / Activity / Deliverables / Target Dates:
1.	 Create initial model based on data from SESFC.  
Activity:
Dr. Margaret Miller and colleagues with NOAA?s SEFSC have been monitoring remnant A. palmate colonies in five reefs off of Key Largo, FL, every three months for over two years.  From this data an index of live tissue (analogous to biomass or abundance of fish) is calculated by estimating the living surface area of the coral colony.  Data is being gathered using the same or similar methods in St. John, Curacao, and Navassa.  Among these regions A palmate populations vary in recruitment rate, dominant method of reproduction (sexual versus asexual), and population densities.  Comparison of population trends among these regions will be critical, as this data provides natural experiments, or at least explorations of parameter space, enhancing the predictive and descriptive power of modeling analyses.  Corals are structured by size, and the Contractor will use measurements from SEFSC to create a size-based matrix population model for Florida initially and for other regions as the data becomes available.  Results of this model will include estimates of the rate of change in population size and time to extinction for each population.

2.	Calibrate SEFSC data methodology to insure its appropriateness for population modeling.  

Activity:
In order to ensure that the SEFSC method of data collection is appropriate for modeling, during Fall 2007, the Contractor will collect data on growth and shrinkage on the Key Largo colonies using digital photography and measurement of branch lengths.  Incorporating fine-scale three-dimensional modeling of branching coral morphology, the Contractor will develop an algorithm whereby the photos and branch length measurement will be translated into a more accurate assessment of live tissue.  Finally the Contractor will determine if there are discrepancies in the model output, between the more accurate assessment and the SEFSC assessment, and adjust the model accordingly.

3.	Collect, process, and analyze field data.  

Activity:
In order to gain a clearer picture of the status of A. palmate throughout the Caribbean, the Contractor will begin monitoring populations in at least one novel location, likely Jamaica, where sexual recruits have been documented, in Fall 2007.

4.	Create draft population model for Acropora palmate for at least one other location.  

Activity:
Repeat field work from Objective 3 in Summer 2008.  Integrate results from all field studies including those from SEFSC into a revised model.  Conduct an elasticity analysis on the various life stages utilized in the revised model.  Elasticity analysis is appropriate for organisms, like acroporids and many marine invertebrates, with long generation times and a low proportion of surviving young.  This analysis will help determine which life stages are most critical to protect for species recovery.  To maximize the utility of the population dynamic model and increase its reflection of reality, the Contractor will also run model simulations to evaluate the relative effect of various risk factors, such as disease, hurricanes, stochastic factors, and Allee effects.  Simulating under these scenarios using data from the literature, the Contractor will examine the model for trajectories of change in population decline.  Stochastic dynamics are critical for populations that exists so far below (at 2% of) their carrying capacity.  Demographic stochasticity in particular is important to consider when modeling small population size.  A simulation model incorporating stochasticities and Allee effects will mark a significant advancement in population modeling for corals.  The Contractor will extrapolate the results to A. cervicornis to the extent feasible.  Results from the revised model and the above-described analyses will comprise the final report. 

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) located in Miami, FL, intends to establish a fixed price purchase order for five (5) Current Pressure Inverted Echo Sounders (CPIES) with the Paros 410K pressure option and Internal radio/Flasher that will be utilized by AOML on a sole source basis from the University of Rhode Island (URI), Kingston, RI based on the following reasons:  1) AOML has acquired several of these instruments in recent years from URI and needs to acquire 5 additional systems; 2) URI is the only known manufacturer of these systems and most certainly is the only known vendor that has the extensive knowledge and experience required to build field proven IES; 3) AOML has already acquired nearly all the supporting equipment needed to prepare, trouble shoot, maintain, operate and communicate with the URI IES; 4) This instrument is deployed from a ship at the site of interest where it sinks to the bottom of the ocean and must remain there for periods of up to 5 years while it acquires and logs the data, while on the ocean bottom, the CPIES periodically transmits an acoustic pulse, which travels from the bottom of the ocean to the surface then back to the bottom where it is detected by the instrument.  The scientists and engineers at the URI have devoted a lot of time and effort to the design and develop the CPIES and are acknowledged as the leaders in the use of these instruments in oceanographic research and the analysis and interpretation of the data.  They have refined their design based on the results of these deployments to improve the measurement accuracy, reliability, and the resulting data quality.  5) Since these instruments are deployed for periods of up to 5 years an acoustic telemetry system must be built into the CPIES so that a synopsis of the data can be obtained periodically from a ship without retrieving the instrument.  URI developed a technique of condensing the data and transmitting it acoustically to a ship so that the instruments do not have to be brought to the surface to get the data; 6) The system URI developed uses a complicated structure of various acoustic frequencies, pulse width, and timing differences to transmit the information to the ship.  The ship then uses a deck set to decode these acoustic signals into digital information that is recorded and converted by a computer into data values for the scientists; 7) To change vendors would require an expensive duplication of effort and resources. 

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using the acquisition processes set forth in FAR part 12, Commercial Items.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses.  However, all responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Responses can be faxed to Carey Marlow at (816) 274-6923 or submitted via email to carey.m.marlow@noaa.gov .  Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, and address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications; and any additional supporting literature describing its product in sufficient detail for the Government to determine whether competition exists for a CPIES that meets all the requirements in form, fit, and function.  Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on the following criteria: 1) Demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required CPIES equipment with Paros 410K pressure option and internal radio/flasher.  The applicable NAICS code is 334516.

Firms must have adequate staffing and be able to handle multiple projects simultaneously within the United States to provide comprehensive planning, design for Land Ports of Entry (LPOE) on the northern and southern borders of the United States; to provide outstanding quality, value and operational design. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances function, cost, constructability, aesthetics, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for the nation's chief border inspection agency's employees while conveying to visitors the strength and democratic values of the nation.  They are to address the complex operational issues of a Land Port of Entry and be efficient to build and maintain. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements and the facility will be designed in metric units. All projects will be LEED certified, and shall be designed to meet the Silver standard as defined in the U.S. Green Buildings Council in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System to the extent the budget allows. 

Projects will be renovated, expanded or new land ports of entry on the northern and/or southern border.

The facilities comprise multiple buildings, including inspection facilities, garages, and offices, as well as complex site circulation and inspection technologies. The LPOEs will be secure facilities that also act as gateways to our country and should make an architectural statement that is appropriate and responsive to the local context, efficient movement of trade and commerce, the security requirements of law enforcement agencies, and the flexibility of changing operational and technological requirements. Expedited design and delivery approaches will be promoted, including prototype design, bundling of projects, prefabricated and modular construction, and use of pre-designed components.

The final designs will be operationally complex and technologically sophisticated site and civil-intensive projects with a balance between aesthetic, functional, and security issues, including state-of-the-art data and telecommunications systems, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and other requirements. 

The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: problem analysis, feasibility studies, energy analysis, life cycle costing, building information modeling, surveys, site and existing conditions surveys, design, planning, interior design, traffic and civil engineering, and estimating services for new construction, and repair and alteration projects. At times the contract may also require selected firms to provide civil engineering, boundary and topographical surveying, sustainable design, environmental studies, quality control testing, asbestos sampling/hazard assessment/ abatement design, historic structure reports, building evaluation reports, scope development, construction management, and other architectural, engineering and technical services.

The selected A/E firms may be required to provide design services that include alternative energy, prefabrication or modular construction, and/or expedited design and delivery solutions.  The selected A/E firms may be required to participate in peer review processes. All facilities will be designed in metric units. There will be no limit on the amount paid on individual delivery orders and no limit on project size; however the total cumulative delivery order amount shall not exceed $12 million in any one contract period, and the minimum guaranteed contract amount is $1000 for the base year and each of the option years, if exercised.

<DESC>RFI Title: Tracking and Managing Extracts from Secure Systems. Sensitive Agency Information. Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
	
Action: It is requested that information relating to current solutions and future implementations of applications, tools, appliances, and associated procedures to address managing tracking, reporting, and erasure of Sensitive Agency Information, extracted from databases and other controlled systems and environments as directed by OMB M-06-16 be provided to GSA as result of issuance of this RFI. 

Disclaimer: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information they furnish must comply with the SEC confidential treatment regulations at 17 C.F.R. 200.83.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.

GSA is providing this RFI on behalf of another Federal Agency.

Summary:
The tracking, managing, protecting, and erasure of Sensitive Agency Information, particularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII), extracted from a controlled IT environment such as data stores and databases are of significant interest to the Federal Government.  Security breaches from several Federal Agencies over the past two years resulting in unauthorized release of PII have heightened the need for a focused solution.

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum M-06-16, Protection of Sensitive Agency Information (SAI), identifies four Action Items addressing defensive IT controls to assist in maintaining elevated security environments for Sensitive Agency Information.  Action Item #4 recommends all Federal Agencies Log all computer-readable data extracts from databases holding sensitive information and verify each extract including sensitive data has been erased within 90 days or its use is still required.  Addressing this Action Item within the variety of Federal Agency IT environments and unique organizational needs will require an integrated and intelligent solution from industry.  An effective, cost efficient, operational solution is the goal of this RFI.

Federal Agency data stores and information repositories include legacy and new technologies span the enterprise, and include mainframes, Storage Area Networks/Network Attached Storage (SAN /NAS), databases, file servers, email servers, etc. and potentially, web and application servers.  As technology evolves, so Federal IT diversity expands.  With government growth, so grows the need to share data in a controlled, secure manner.  Thus, authorized systems, applications, and scripts extract and share information from a multitude of Agency repositories with a plethora of stakeholders.  Agencies and their organizations must manage these information transfers, and endow both parties with the confidence that information is safe and maintained within understood bounds and paradigms.

However, problems arise as information moves farther from an Agency core and beyond its central control. Once out of managed, secure data repositories and traversing beyond the reach of established alerting and access controls, disparate protection methods no longer provide adequate insight or management.  How secure is Personally Identifiable Information once it has entered this unstructured environment? Where it moves, who accesses it, or what manipulations are done to it can no longer be established nor controlled. New tools are needed that extend Enterprise information oversight and protection into less structured environments. Technology is needed that can determine how this information is stored and dispersed, to manage data deletion compliance after it is no longer required; and thus secure information to the degree within, or on-par with, the original repository.

Further Contact Information:
Attn: Jon D. Faye
Contracting Officer

Based on OMB June 23, 2006 release of memorandum M-06-16, the GSA is requesting responses from industry corporations, scientists, researchers, and organizations that represent the Information Technology (IT) industry data leakage, tracking and management community, on how best to implement a solution to identify, track, manage, log, report, and erase Sensitive Agency Information (SAI), particularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII), extracted from databases and other controlled environments, within Agency, and its sub-organization, IT architectures, as it traverses and settles across the Enterprise. 

The GSA requests descriptions of industry approaches, practices, and capabilities to provide the services requested in this RFI.  Responses shall address listed objectives, and not be used to provide marketing material. Vendors shall explain how their solution and/or products will meet the goal of achieving OMB M-06-16, Action Item #4. Vendors shall explain if their products meet this requirement out-of-the-box, if customization and integration is required, as well as in-whole or in-part. Vendors are also encouraged to propose alternative approaches that may be different than the generic solution outlined in this RFI. However, the various solution components and/or target points of data extraction and subsequent storage must be addressed.  

For purposes of this RFI, the term Personally Identifiable Information (PII), defined by OMB M-06-19, means any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual identity, such as their name, social security number, date and place of birth, mothers maiden name, biometric records, etc., including any other personal information which is linked or linkable to an individual.  

Based on the various IT environments implemented across Federal Agencies, and in coordination with Federal Enterprise Architecture requirements and recommendations, a solution that can integrate with existing Agency architectures is envisioned. Thus, the solution must be versatile, allowing placement of components or software in conjunction with a variety of IT environments. These environments include, but are not limited to mainframes, SAN/NAS, databases; file, email, web and application servers; etc., and the tape archival systems that support them. Additionally, environments will include workstations, portable devices such as laptops, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices, and media such as DVDs and CDs. Functions within the vendor solution shall monitor PII extractions and archive tracking data (date and time SAI was removed, entities performing the extract, and extracted data or its representation).  Any SAI or PII stored within solution components or sent between components shall be protected, possibly through encryption or some other mechanism, according to federal security standards. There shall be proactive solution processes implementing compliance of Federal recommendations for erasure/removal of SAI within 90 days from the date the information is no longer needed. The solution shall have a central management component/console which tracks, records, consolidates and correlates, and may initiate pre-determined actions on SAI. The management component therefore, shall provide reporting of all solution functions. 

A.	PII Monitoring and Managing Solution Objectives
The high level objectives of this RFI are summarized as follows.
1.	Data security controls shall be an integral process/function to the proposed solution addressing Federal confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements. 
2.	Ability to identify or tag, and log SAI data removed/extracted from secure IT data repositories.
3.	Ability to manage (log, track, monitor, and report) PII as it traverses across, and outside of, the Enterprise Architecture in various electronic forms.
4.	Ability to manage various electronic data formats, including database extracts, images, *.pdf files, text and spreadsheet documents.

12.	Ability to scan in coordination with, and report to, a central management component. 
13.	Ability to perform proactive scanning of network segments or specific nodes for PII creation, storage, and compliance with time-based erasure/relocation/archival requirements and policy.
14.	Ability to perform reactive scanning of network segments or specific nodes for known data extractions, data replications, and compliance with time-based erasure/relocation/archival requirements and policy.
15.	Ability to control access to PII data stored or transmitted by solution components providing confidentiality, integrity and proper availability.
16.	Ability to protect, possibly through encryption, SAI stored on solution components.
17.	Ability to protect, possibly through encryption, communications between solution components. 
18.	Ability to integrate with existing Identity Management Access Control methodologies (PKI Certificates, Tokens, etc.).
19.	Ability to track and report PII when written to portable storage and media.


B.	Supplemental Objectives
1.	Ability, once data has been identified or tagged, to protect it from unauthorized release or distribution.
2.	Ability to report and provide metrics on occurrences and quantities of SAI or PII data elements (Social Security Number (SS#), address, DOB, financial data, etc.).
3.	Ability to report and provide metrics of the most significant user, program, or other criteria; e.g. creator of PII material, or program with most extracted material, etc. 
4.	Ability to encrypt data written to portable storage.
5.	Ability to accommodate disconnected end-user devices within the solution, e.g. either by reporting disconnected devices containing SAI at last connection, or once reconnected rescanning devices for previous or new SAI content.
6.	Ability to manage (log, track, monitor, report and erase) remote extractions of SAI and PII from the Enterprise, or the sharing of SAI and PII between Agencies.

In addition to the typical descriptive reply, vendors shall respond by listing the objective above with their response to immediately follow, thus assisting assessors who evaluate the degree of objective achievement.

Supplemental Information:

PII Monitoring and Managing Solution Concept

Federal Agencies have an extremely wide variety of operational environments across their various enterprises, and therefore require flexible, versatile solutions. The description below and Diagram 1, PII Monitoring and Management Solution Concept, provides visual perspective and insight into a possible solution to the described scenario. 
 
Insert Diagram 1, PII Monitoring and Management Solution Concept here???

Example Scenario
Agency mission information is located in various enterprise repositories, the largest being their mainframe. Data maintained and protected within various logical partitions contains PII data collected while achieving the agency, and its sub-organization, missions. A nightly script accesses several databases and extracts data, containing PII, for consolidation and future application processing. Days later, analysts within the Agency access this consolidated information from an application server through a thick client, transferring data with PII to their workstations. As the agency has vague rules prohibiting PII removal, an analyst exports several data sets, and copies them to a CD for transport to another office. 

In this scenario PII exists in four locations (the mainframe database, application server, workstation, and CD); and on potentially three devices that do not control access in accordance with permissions established on the original databases (workstation, CD, and depending on the permissions assigned, application server). The distribution (writing PII to CD) accommodates PII removal from the Agency physical as well as logical protections without accommodating for its management.

In order to comply with M-06-16 in the above scenario, a solution would need to address the following:
1.	Identify PII upon extraction from the mainframe and application server databases;
2.	Track and manage PII located on the analysts workstations;
3.	Track, manage, and protect PII distributed to portable media (CD);
4.	Manage PII establishing the ninety-day erasure period, and on the ninetieth-day announcing the need to erase (or performing erasure/relocation);
5.	Monitor/scan the workstation to determine if identified PII remains, was distributed, reconfigured or deleted/relocated;
6.	Securely report changes in PII to the scanning application or management component;
7.	Scan workstations periodically to determine if new PII exists, or was distributed; and,
8.	Collect and intelligently present status of PII located throughout the enterprise.

PII Monitoring and Managing Solution Concept Components

Vendor responses need not be limited by the architecture described herein.  Solutions that involve some of the components described, or seek to address the above objectives in a totally different manner, are welcome. Partial solutions are acceptable. Solutions allowing for options addressing this situation, such as component/service cafeteria-style selection, to meet various objectives and needs is acceptable. Descriptions of how the complete implementation of policy, products and services will be deployed in an Enterprise environment are encouraged.

The following are functional descriptions of solution concept components.  

1.	The PII Monitoring Appliance.
A PII Monitoring Appliance shall have the ability to be placed in front of, or in conjunction with, various data repositories throughout the Enterprise (mainframes, SAN/NAS, databases; file, email, web and application servers). As PII data is extracted from a repository it shall be identified; along with a date/time stamp, the credentialed individual who or authorized process that performed the extraction; and reported to the management component/console for subsequent management (log, track, monitor, report, and erasure). This component would allow integration across significantly varied architectures. Communications between components shall be secure.

2.	The PII Monitoring Application.     
A PII Monitoring Application shall perform similar functions as the Monitoring Appliance but do so on an end-node (workstation, laptop, server, PDA, etc.). It shall also confirm the existence of previously identified PII, and scrutinize the system for any PII reconfiguration activities such as copy/paste to other data formats (database extracts into Word documents, spreadsheets; images files, etc.), as well as PII creation and generation.
The Monitoring Application shall detect data replication to any portable storage (CD/DVD, USB, etc.), or supplemental enterprise storage such as a network drive. Additionally, the Monitoring Application would monitor for any pending distributions such as email, instant messaging, web posting, etc. of PII, and potentially prevent this distribution. PII distributions and attempts shall be reported to a management component/console. Communications between components shall be secure. This Component should allow the end user to group related PII and manage collectively to reduce administrative efforts.

3.	The PII Management Component/Console.     
A PII Management Component/Console shall provide the ability to set criteria for identification of PII.  This component shall consolidate, store and present in an intelligent and efficient manner the location and status of PII identified or tagged from extraction points, to secondary storage, to end user nodes.  This component shall have the ability to consolidate tracking of PII movement throughout the Enterprise, log PII data manipulation; and provide consolidated management views/reports of PII status per node, per user, per project, etc.
The PII management component/console must also be able to direct the scanning appliance to perform scans, and maintain these results. Scan results shall be coordinated with previous scan results to provide further information and insights. Information shall have the ability to be sorted, filtered, and analyzed thus providing an Enterprise perspective. The PII Management Console shall provide reporting, trending, and graphing capabilities. 
Communications between components shall be secure.

4.	The PII Scanning Appliance.     
A PII Scanning Appliance shall perform scans on specific network segments, devices, and nodes, as directed by the management component/console. All results would be presented to the management component/console for long-term storage, management, analysis, and reporting. Communications between components shall be secure.

<DESC>U. S. Army Research Development & Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, Picatinny, NJ is conducting a market survey  to identify sources with  the capability/device to keep track of the location of shipping containers and  other items, essentially anywhere in the world.  The desired capability will  ideally have the following characteristics: The device shall enable a remote user to be able to view the position of the  containers by viewing a database that reflects the information provided by the  device. The device ideally would be no larger than approximately 6 cubic inches.  A  smaller size is preferred.  A device larger than 6 cubic inches is still of  interest however. One dimension ideally would not exceed one inch to ensure that the device could  be mounted to a shipping container between the structural ribs  to avoid  damage. The device would ideally have a life span of at least 6 months based on  reporting its position once per day.  The greater the life span the better.   Position reporting precision ideally would be within 100 feet of the  containers true position.  However, a capability that can only provide  position reports with errors of as much as a mile or two are also of interest.   The device must be able to withstand the elements of outdoor use to include  rain, and extreme high and low temperatures. Cost in quantities of 10,000 ideally would be less than $100 each. The Government is interested in hearing from organizations that may have novel  approaches to accomplish some or all of these desired elements.  Items that are  under development, but not fully matured are also of interest.  Low monthly  communication related charges are also very important  preferably less than  $10/mo. All responses must include company name, address, POC, phone number, fax  number, and email address and are required by August 16, 2007.   This is not a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the  Government. Submittal of information is requested via electronic mail to Jim  Fedewitz (973-724-3924) e-mail:  fedewitz@pica.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a cost reimburstment sole source award for the evaluation of the effects of AMIGAS, an HIV prevention intervention (adapted version of SISTA for Latinas) using a two-arm randomized controlled trial design with three-month post-intervention follow-up data.  This award will be made pursuant to FAR 6.302(a)(2), ?when supplies or services are available from only one responsible source.?  The CDC has identified the Miami?Dade County Health Department, a large government agency, located at 8600 Northwest 17th Street, Miami, FL 33126, as the sole source to provide the requirement.  The period of performance of the contract is from September 15, 2007 through September 14, 2009.  The Miami-Dade County Health Department has developed an adapted form of the SISTA intervention for Latina women.  This adaptation is critical because it is developed from a scientifically based intervention (SISTA) for African American women. The AMIGAS intervention is essential to our requirement of ensuring consistency with the original research thereby precluding consideration of other adapted interventions for Latinas developed by other agencies/companies.  Because the Miami-Dade County Health Department is the subject matter expert (SME) and the developer of this adapted intervention, it is the only organization suited to conduct this project. However, responsible sources who believe they can provide the required services may submit a written capability statement, via e-mail to Dyad Searcy at dsearcy@cdc.gov, no later than 15 days from the published date of this announcement, July 31, 2007.  Telephone inquiries will be considered nonresponsive.

<SUBJECT>PEO-IWS Library, Software, Hardware Asset Reuse Enterprise (SHARE)
<DESC>In August 2006, the Program Executive Officer, Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO-IWS) established a library of combat system software and related assets for use by eligible contractors (both prime contractors and subcontractors) for developing or suggesting improvements to Navy Surface Warfare Systems.  The PEO-IWS library, Software, Hardware Asset Reuse Enterprise (SHARE) is presently being populated. The SHARE repository has recently been updated to Version 1.1, which incorporates several new enhancements.  These enhancements include the ability to designate multiple SHARE assets via a single request and a new per program licensing process, which requires users requesting multiple component assets under a single program (system)  to submit only one Terms-of-Use Agreement (TOUA) and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Additional enhancements include an improved contractor licensing process, which requires a TOUA be signed by an authorized official of the requesting organization but now only allows for a single NDA signed by this same authorized official.  Additional requesting organization personnel remain required to execute an NDA, however they need not all be identified at the time of the original request.  Finally, the automatically generated, contractor notification e-mail has been updated to describe the required steps/actions necessary to complete the request process; a new automatically generated, notification e-mail (sent once a contractor has prepared a SHARE asset request and confirmed that the TOUA and NDA have been sent to the COR/TOM/GPOR) has been implemented to provide the designated COR/TOM/GPOR the required steps/actions necessary to complete the request process; and a new automatically generated, government notification e-mail (sent once a government employee has prepared a SHARE asset request) has been implemented to provide the required steps/actions necessary to complete the request process. As of June 2007, 56 assets and artifacts from the Aegis, Ship Self Defense System (SSDS), Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), and DDG-1000 programs are available in the SHARE library.  PEO-IWS encourages all current Navy contractors and potential Navy contractors to register for access to the SHARE library to discover the assets it presently contains as well as to contribute assets that may be useful to the Navy and its contracting community in the future. Access to the library is restricted to contractors that are participating as a prime or subcontractor in active Navy contracts that include warfare or weapons system software maintenance or development.  Contractors that do not hold an active Navy warfare or weapon systems software or maintenance contract may be granted access by entering into a Cooperative Research and Development agreement with a Navy activity.  Access shall require Secret facility and personnel clearance and a DD Form 254.  Access to, and employment of, SHARE assets shall be for Government Purposes Only.  Access is voluntary and there is no warranty associated with assets contained in the library.  Those companies interested in registering for access to the library should visit and complete an on-line registration form at https://viewnet.nswc.navy.mil.  To register for an account, click on the Register your CAC or Digital Certificate for Access link, select New Member and SHARE as your program of interest, and complete the form. This unclassified site provides a mechanism to discover library materials that are available within SHARE, as those materials are populated.  The site also hosts the license agreement and NDA that are required for obtaining library materials.  Library materials will be provided either on-line through access to the appropriate portion of the SHARE web site (classified or unclassified) or via delivery of physical media. The registration process for the classified portion of the site over SIPRNET (https://viewnet.nswcdd.navy.smil.mil) is the same as the unclassified portion above, except no digital certificate is required. [Note:  The unclassified site URL may not be accessible to your company due to IP filtering.  If that is the case, please contact the helpdesk at 540-663-4507 and provide them with the IP address(es) you will be using to access the site.] THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN07-43 Human Assisted Neural Devices (HAND)
<DESC>Human Assisted Neural Devices RFI, SN07-43, Responses Due 4 P.M. ET, August 15, 2007, POC: Dr. Geoffrey Ling, DARPA/DSO; Phone: (571) 218-4674; Fax: (703) 807-4956.

Description

The Human Assisted Neural Devices (HAND) program at DARPA has provided the basis for a number of assistive devices controlled, in part, by neural signals provided by the user. There is continued interest in discovering the underlying processing structures the brain uses to perform tasks, with the eventual goal of leveraging these processes with algorithms and models that can control external assistive devices. 

An approach that takes into account the distributed nature of neural functioning, the dynamics of neural plasticity and changes to functional networks, as well as analysis that encompass the wide spatial and temporal scales of neural processing is more appropriately descriptive of the underlying information processes of the brain. Consequently, a new experimental and theoretical paradigm is needed if we are to advance beyond incremental advances in development. 

Information Sought

This RFI seeks information on relevant technologies and concepts that could form the basis for a DARPA program to develop a HAND Phase Next. This RFI seeks methods of analysis and interpretation that will enable the control of next generation assistive devices that seek to interpret and treat issues of control and feedback that are more analogous to processes used by the brain. Moreover, this RFI is interested in methods which will provide more robust control of dexterous systems while reducing compilation of data, training time on device use, and alleviating computational burdens. 
Specifically, this RFI seeks information on relevant technologies, capabilities, and concepts in the following areas:

1.	Cross-regional data extraction: Neural functions are anatomically focused in certain areas of the brain, but the underlying task processes are distributed across several regions. By accessing the processes at numerous nodes in the brain, more robust control methods can be developed
2.	Multi-signal extraction: Information transmission between neurons is mediated by chemical and electrical means. This RFI seeks methods that can interpret and extract information from a broad spectrum of transmission methods that might include neurotransmitter levels and release/reuptake, pre- and post-synaptic potentials, and action potentials. 
3.	Rule-based interpretation: Methods which attempt to determine the underlying principles of information organization and transmission between neurons and synapses may be more successful in establishing more robust methods of controlling devices that rely on less data.  
4.	Multi-modality sensory feedback: This RFI seeks new methods of providing feedback to the user separate from visual cues.  More natural ways to interpret sensory feedback may lead to faster acquisition of device use and ease of interpretation of new stimuli. 
5.	Plasticity: Current methods of control rely on algorithms which must be adjusted as functional networks change and users adapt to new tasks. This RFI seeks new methods which allow interfaces to automatically compensate for the adaptive nature of the brain.

STATEMENT OF WORK

FOR 

LEAN SIX SIGMA (LSS) PROCESS IMPROVEMENT 

A.	Purpose: The United States Commission on Civil Rights, hereafter referred to as the ?Commission,? requires an expert in process mapping and improvement methodologies; specifically, Lean and Six Sigma (DMAIC, DMADV, and DFSS).  The expert consultant must have prior experience working with the public sector entities, reviewing agency processes, making concrete recommendations for improvement, and implementing recommendations and evaluating the results. 

The expert will use Lean Six Sigma methodologies to:

?	optimize the Commission?s process flow (e.g., improve an existing process by identifying and removing wasteful and non-value added steps/activities, and  creating and/or formalizing agency processes in two key areas), 
?	increase consistency of output by minimizing variation within the process, and 
?	increase process efficiency (e.g., speed, cost reduction, timeliness) in two key performance areas.   
Throughout the process the expert will work closely with agency leadership, supervisors, managers, and staff to:

?	define the Commission?s improvement goals related to two key areas: the re-chartering process for its 51 State advisory committees (SACs) and the  national office report production process, 
?	measure and understand existing processes related to these two areas and collect relevant data, 
?	analyze the effectiveness of the processes and identify factors influencing effectiveness,
?	identify process improvements and other changes that will optimize the process effectiveness, and 
?	revise or design (as necessary) the processes to increase the consistency of output and achieve an overall high level of performance.    

B.	Background: The Commission is an independent federal agency with a staff of fewer than 50 full time employees and a budget of approximately $9 million. The Commission performs an important role in identifying emergent civil rights trends and evaluating federal agency civil rights enforcement programs. As the only independent agency in the federal government to be exclusively concerned with the full range of issues related to civil rights, the Commission is charged with keeping the President, Congress and the public informed of current civil rights issues, including discrimination or denial of equal protection of the laws because of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability, or national origin, or in the administration of justice.  
Its headquarters and six regional offices carry out the work of the Commission through a staff of civil rights analysts, social scientists, attorneys, and other personnel.   Headquarters is located in Washington, DC and the regional offices are located in Atlanta, Denver, Kansas City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and the District of Columbia.     

State Advisory Committee (SAC) Charters 

The six regional offices support and coordinate the activities of the Commission?s 51 statutorily created SACs.  The SACs serve as the Commission?s ?eyes and ears? on civil rights issues at the regional, state, and local levels.  The SAC re-chartering process is primarily handled by the Commission?s six regional directors with guidance from the Staff Director.

Each SAC operates under a two-year charter and must be re-chartered at the end of that term. Twelve SACs are currently chartered and the remaining committees must be re-chartered.  Formalizing the specific actions required to timely re-charter a SAC and  comply with applicable Commission policies concerning SAC charters and committee membership are central to the agency?s goal of increasing the number of chartered SACs. It is also imperative in light of anticipated and planned retirements in the Commission?s regional offices that will result in a loss of institutional memory concerning SAC-related processes.  The process generally requires:

?	tracking the expiration dates of the varies SAC charters, 
?	creating a proposal for timely re-chartering expiring SACs,
?	identifying potential SAC members through independent research and networking, as well as a result of recommendations by the staff director, and the commissioners 
?	contacting and recruiting the potential members, 
?	submitting applications to interested potential members and reviewing completed submissions, 
?	completing the memorandum signed by the staff director renewing the charter,
?	submitting a complete re-charter and appointment package for review and approval by the Staff Director, 
?	obtaining approval by vote of a majority of the commissioners,  and
?	updating information maintained in a government-wide SAC database.  

National Office Report Production 

The Commission adopted and implemented new policies governing the planning and approval of agency projects that result in written reports examining various civil rights issues. These policies also established standards for ensuring the quality and objectivity of Commission reports. Among the changes are requirements for the:

?	submission of discovery plans for review and approval that explain the proposed use of interrogatories, subpoenas, document requests and other requests for information from external sources,   
?	submission of project outlines that include a summary of research, a discussion of the scope and direction of the project, a statement on the proposed project methodology, and a project completion timeline, and 
?	submission of a first draft of each project report for review and comment before Commission staff prepares a final draft.

Commission projects should be concluded within 12 to 18 months of their initiations.  LSS process mapping should include all applicable background, research, planning, outlines, discovery, and review and approval requirements, as well as ensure that they are completed within the accepted timeframe.   
  
C.	Objectives: The Commission seeks to define, measure, analyze, and improve its processes related to (1) timely re-chartering SACs and (2) producing national office project reports.  The agency?s Lean Six Sigma objectives related to SAC charters are the delineation and implementation of a process that (consistent with existing Commission policies and regulations):

?	provides efficiency in re-chartering SACs by formalizing and standardizing SAC member recruitment and appointment activities, 
?	provides efficiency in re-chartering  by reducing the amount of time required to re-charter SACs, and
?	provides SAC member recruitment and appointments means that result in diverse skills, talents, backgrounds, experiences, views and opinions being represented.    

The agency?s Lean Six Sigma objectives related to national report production are the delineation and implementation of a process that (consistent with existing Commission policies and regulations): 

?	provides efficient report preparation by formalizing and standardizing report preparation activities,
?	provides for and supports the completion of reports within 12 to 18 months following initiation of the project,
?	provides for and supports the completion of all procedural requirements governing project development and management including, but no limited to, project planning (e.g., production of concepts and proposals), design, discovery, and execution, and
?	provides for and supports the implementation of Commission objectivity and quality standards of its reports, including review and approval of the proposed final report by internal and external sources.

The Commission seeks to improve staff communication and teamwork, and to create momentum and support for continued organizational change in two program functions.  

Obtaining Commission staff Black or Green Belt certification is not an objective of this initiative.  
 
D.	Scope: The Consultant will perform the following duties, functions and responsibilities: 

?	Provide expert and experience-based recommendations for improving, standardizing, and formalizing Commission processes related to SAC re-chartering and national office report production. This task includes defining, measuring, and analyzing Commission processes, and verifying that implemented recommendations are efficient and effective. 
?	Conduct a one-day orientation with Commission leadership in Washington, DC (approximately 6 participants) that describes the key goals, objectives, and elements of LSS and process improvement, describes the LSS methodology as applied to the Commissions processes, and proposes a work plan and timeline for concluding LSS process.    
?	Conduct a one-day orientation and training for approximately 10-12 designated Commission staff (referred to as the Process Improvement Team) in Washington, DC.
?	Consult with Commission leadership and the Process Improvement Team, as necessary, to produce draft and final process improvement maps/plans for the designated two key functions.  
?	Conduct an exit meeting with designated Commission leadership and staff to present and discuss the final process improvement maps/plans. 
?	Provide follow-up support and other support as defined by the Commission as necessary to ensure that successful implementation of the LSS initiative.  
E. 	Travel:  Consultant travel should be limited to two anticipated training and/or orientation sessions, one staff consultation, and an exit meeting all held in Washington, DC.  All other meetings and consultations between the expert and Commission leadership and staff should be conducted by telephone, email, and fax.  Additional travel, however, may be considered and approved by the Commission.  If additional travel is approved, the consultant will be reimbursed for actual out-of-pocket expenses, subject to limitations of federal laws and regulations, and Commission travel policy.  
F.	Progress Report: Provide an oral status report to the Staff Director within 7 calendar days following the conclusion of the orientation and training meetings for Commission leadership and the Process Improvement Team.   
G. 	Qualification Requirements: The Consultant must possess at least five years experience applying LSS and designing business processes for public sector entities.  The Consultant must be at least Black Belt certified in Six Sigma. 
H. 	Deliverables: There are seven (7) deliverables: 
?	two one-day orientation and training meetings,

<DESC>This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17. This solicitation is set aside for small business concerns, NAICS 111421, Nursery and Tree Production, with a small business size standard of $750,000 gross receipts each year, for the last three years. The National Park Service encourages the participation of small, disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses. The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose total offer represents the best value for the Government, price and other factors considered.  This RFQ is estimated to be under $20,000. BACKGROUND: San Juan Island National Historical Park (park) has initiated action to restore native prairie habitat within the park's American Camp Unit. During the mid-1800s, the restoration area served as the site of encampment for American military troops during an international boundary conflict between England and the United States. Over many centuries, humans have extensively disturbed and manipulated the area, including use of the site for Native American encampments, a sheep farm, a military installation, and other activities.       The items and work provided through this contract will enable the park to finalize the methodology necessary to undertake large-scale restoration of native prairie in the American Camp Unit.    Scope of Work:  The work of this contract consists of providing native plant material (i.e., "plugs") of two sizes and supplying equipment necessary to plant such material.  Work may be performed under a single contract or multiple contracts that best suit the government's needs.   Item 1 - Small Native-Grass Plugs.  The contractor will provide 200,000 plugs approximately one inch in diameter by 2.5 inches in length.  For reference, Plantel Nurseries, Inc.'s "Plantel 192 Tray" provides acceptable dimensions, although other similarly sized planting cells will be acceptable. Of the 200,000 plugs, one-half (i.e., 100,000) will be Roemer's fescue (Festuca roemeri), while the other half (i.e., 100,000) will be Alaska brome (Bromus sitchensis).  The park will provide sufficient seed necessary to cultivate one-to-three seeds in each small native-grass plug.   Small native-grass plugs must be live, vigorous and weed free. Vigor will be defined by a minimum plug diameter of approximately one inch and root length of approximately 2.5 inches. Plugs must contain only Roemer's fescue or Sitka brome; all other weeds and plant species must be completely eliminated before delivering plugs to the park.   Plugs may be fertilized to enhance growth but any such fertilization must cease one-month prior to delivery.  Plants also must be "hardened off" prior to delivery to enhance survival following outplanting.   The requested delivery date for small plugs is no later than Monday, November 5, 2007.  Plugs will be delivered to the park's American Camp Visitor Center on San Juan Island in original planting containers.   Item 2 - Large Native-Grass Plugs. The contractor will provide approximately 23,000 plugs approximately 1.5 inch in diameter by 8.25 inches in length.  For reference, Stuewe and Sons, Inc.'s "Ray-Leach SC10-size cone-tainer" provides acceptable dimensions, although other similarly sized planting cells will be acceptable. Of the 23,000 plugs, one-half (i.e., 11,500) will be Roemer's fescue (Festuca roemeri), while the other half (i.e., 11,500) will be Alaska brome (Bromus sitchensis). The park will provide sufficient seed necessary to cultivate one-to-three seeds in each large native-grass plug.   Large native-grass plugs must be live, vigorous and weed free. Vigor will be defined by a minimum plug diameter of approximately 1.5 inches and root length of approximately 8.25 inches.  Plugs must contain only Roemer's fescue or Sitka brome; all other weeds and plant species must be completely eliminated before delivering plugs to the park. Plugs may be fertilized to enhance growth but any such fertilization must cease one-month prior to delivery. Plants also must be "hardened off" prior to delivery to enhance survival following outplanting.   The requested delivery date for large plugs is no later than Monday, November 5, 2007.  Plugs will be delivered to the park's American Camp Visitor Center on San Juan Island in original planting containers.   Option 1: Line Item 0003 - Large Native-Grass Plugs.  The contractor will provide up to 77,000 additional plugs approximately 1.5 inch in diameter by 8.25 inches in length.  For reference, Stuewe and Sons, Inc.'s Ray-Leach SC10-size "cone-tainer" provides acceptable dimensions, although other similarly sized planting cells will be acceptable. One-half will be Roemer's fescue (Festuca roemeri), while the other half will be Alaska brome (Bromus sitchensis).  The park will provide sufficient seed necessary to cultivate one-to-three seeds in each large native-grass plug. Large native-grass plugs must be live, vigorous and weed free. Vigor will be defined by a minimum plug diameter of approximately 1.5 inches and root length of approximately 8.25 inches.  Plugs must contain only Roemer's fescue or Sitka brome; all other weeds and plant species must be completely eliminated before delivering plugs to the park. Plugs may be fertilized to enhance growth but any such fertilization must cease one-month prior to delivery.  Plants also must be "hardened off" prior to delivery to enhance survival following outplanting.   Option 2: Line Item 0004 - Plug Planting.  The contractor will provide mechanical equipment and expertise using "no-till" methodology necessary to outplant 200,000 small plugs and up to100,000 large plugs, as described above, within two restoration sites located within the park's American Camp Unit on San Juan Island, Washington. One restoration site is approximately one acre in size; the other restoration site is approximately 1.3 acres in size.  Each site will be sectioned off into plots approximately 0.1-acre in size. One-half of the 0.1-acre plots will be planted with  small plugs spaced approximately in 12-inch rows with three inches between rows; the remaining 0.1-acre plots will be planted with large plugs spaced approximately in 12-inch rows with six inches between rows.       Location of Work: Work to grow native-grass plugs may be completed at any suitable location as determined by the contractor. However, all final plugs must be delivered to the park's American Camp Visitor Center, San Juan Island, Washington. Work to outplant native grass plugs into restoration sites at the park will be conducted at two sites located in the park's American Camp Unit within one-half mile of the American Camp Visitor Center, San Juan Island, Washington.    Performance Period:  The period of performance will begin upon award of contract(s) and continue through January 31, 2008.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
BRAND NAME: CARRIER ACCESS

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Procuring Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity: 

The requiring activity for this action is USAFE CSS/SCML, Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany.  The contracting activity is DISA/DITCO Europe, Building 143, 67681 Sembach-Heuberg, Germany.

2.  Nature/Description of Action:

The proposed contractual action is for other than full and open competition based on 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.  Request approval to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract to resellers of Carrier Access equipment.  A firm-fixed price commercial item type contract is planned and will be issued pursuant to FAR 13.5.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services:

Requirement is for the purchase of Carrier Access ATM Cell multiplexer equipment for the upgrade of the Spangdahlem Technical Control Facility (TCF) under the HQ USAFE TCF Modernization Program.

Listing of requirements:

ITEM 1:  7665-17C, 1700 CHASSIS (INCLUDED 1 CPU AND 1 APM), QTY 9

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority:

10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name Description.

5. Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications:

This is a part of on-going 51 million dollar MAJCOM-wide Modernization Program and the continued integration and implementation of a Technical Control Facility (TCF) Modernization Program.  The first installation was started in FY04 at Aviano, Italy and will continue through 2008.  Currently there are 68 of these devices installed at four bases.  As such, award of another brand would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  These costs include re-engineering, re-certification, and retraining of Government personnel on newly acquired non-standard equipment.  The Carrier Access ATM cell multiplexer equipment is the only solution that provides management to the same granularity and with the same provisioning capabilities provided by the existing Service on Data management platform.  The purchase of other brand items, i.e., non-manageable devices or devices not manageable by the existing management system, would also require additional management servers, management software, and integration software to the overall management system.  The space available within the Network Operations Service Center (NOSC) is limited and allows no room for additional management equipment.  The Carrier Access product line is the only ATM cell multiplexer that has an integrated management capability with the Ericsson (formerly Marconi) TNX series of ATM switches that constitute the core of the new USAFE TCFs.  In addition, the use of a single brand of ATM cell multiplexer will ensure continuity of operations, management, training, and security across the MAJCOM.  Only the Carrier Access Broadmore line of ATM cell multiplexers can ensure this continuity due to software compatibility with previously installed equipment.   In addition, all site surveys and engineering documentation has been completed for the Spangdahlem installation based on the use of the Carrier Access Broadmore line of ATM cell multiplexers, and any other product would result in an estimated loss of 3 months time and associated costs for the re-survey, re-engineering, and re-accomplishment of the project installation package.  Therefore, the purchase of other brand equipment would add unforeseen costs to the overall TCF Upgrade Program.  The total estimated additional costs would be approximately $1.6 million (i.e., re-engineering, installation of new equipment, new software packages to manage the equipment; equipment configuration, and recertifying, and retraining of personnel for both the equipment and the software).  

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources

The synopsis will be combined with the solicitation in accordance with FAR part 12.
All responsive offerors will be considered.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price
	
The Contracting Officer will compete the requirement with resellers of Carrier Access equipment to ensure prices are fair and reasonable.

8.  Description of Market Research 

Market research indicates that there are multiple resellers of Carrier Access equipment:

LTI-Datacom, 23020 Eaglewood Court, Suite 100, Sterling, VA 20166-9503, tel: 703-581-5856.  This is a veteran-owned, small business.

Intelligent Enterprise Solutions LLC, 6901 Rockledge Drive, Suite 600, Bethesda, MD 20827-0076, tel: 866-463-6437.  This is a small business.

Force 3 Inc, 2147 Priest Bridge Drive, Crofton, MD, 21114, tel: 301-261-0204.  This is a small business/8a certified firm.

The research that produced the overarching solution for the USAFE TCF Modernization Program included an evaluation of multiple technologies and equipment manufacturers. This included CISCO, Acorn, NET, Marconi (now Ericsson), Carrier Access, Nortel Networks, and Timeplex, to name just a few.  The evaluation considered the personal experiences of USAFE personnel; a review of product documentation obtained from the web; vendor provided demonstrations and product documentation; a review of currently fielded equipment.  An equipment suite was chosen based on capabilities, integration, and price.  This solution included the selection of the Carrier Access product line as the ATM cell multiplexer.  These devices were then tested in the USAFE Integrated Test and Evaluation Facility to ensure they met the program objectives. 

9.  Supporting Facts:

This brand name of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the USAFE Theater. 

10.  Listing of Interested sources: 

It is anticipated that resellers/wholesalers of these products will express an interest, to include those contractors listed in paragraph 8 above.

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition: 

No action has been taken to remove barriers to competition.  USAFE CSS/SCML must remain with the Carrier Access product line to ensure continuity, compatibility and consistency of existing equipment.  The Government would incur costs in training of personnel and reengineering of non Carrier Access equipment for integration with existing equipment as detailed above.  Competition is limited to multiple resellers of Carrier Access equipment.    

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule

The Government anticipates a 30-day delivery period after contractor?s receipt of order

13.  Reference to Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)
Not applicable. 

14. Section 508 Compliance
Required Section 508 documentation has been provided.

SOLE SOURCE DOCUMENTATION
(For Under $100K)
Brand Name Ericsson (Marconi) Equipment
TSR BF26JUN075096

1.	Identify the activity acquiring the product or service and the geographical area. 

The requiring activity for this action is USAFE CSS/SCML, Ramstein Air Force Base,
Germany. The contracting activity is DISA/DITCO Europe, Building 143,6768I Sembach-
Heuberg, Germany.
		
2.  Describe the supplies and/or services being procured. 

Requirement is for the purchase of Ericsson (previously Marconi) multiservice switch circuit
cards for installation in existing TNX series multiservice switch chassis for the upgrade of the Spangdahlem Technical Control Facility (TCF) under the HQ USAFE TCF Modernization Program.

ITEM 1: NM-4/155MMSCE, OC-3 MM NETMOD, 4-PORT, SC, SERIES E, QTY 4
ITEM 2: NM-4/155SMIRE, OC-3 SM NETMOD, 4-PORT, SC, SERIES E, QTY 3

3.  Provide the rationale, supporting the sole source acquisition.  Justify the use of one source.
 
This equipment purchase is part of an ongoing MAJCOM-wide TCF Modernization Program
and will be an extension of previously purchased and installed equipment. Ericsson (previously
Marconi) is required to ensure consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability.  In addition, this purchase is for circuit cards for installation in existing Ericsson TNX series multiservice switch chassis.  Furthermore, USAFE/A6 is deploying an enterprise remote monitoring and management solution command-wide, which further justifies the Ericsson solution as it allows the USAFE Network Operations and Security Center to use a single tool to manage USAFE ATM equipment
	
4.  Lack of advance planning and funding availability by the requiring activity is not a sufficient justification for sole source procurement?
		N/A
a. Identify, when the procurement first became known? 
		26 June 2007
b. Justify why the time schedule is critical to the organization?s needs, and mission, and state
    the specific critical dates that materially affect the acquisition. 
	    It is not critical
	c. Describe the impact on the organization and or its mission if the schedule is not met.

EPA's Recovered Materials Advisory Notice (RMAN) recommends recycled content levels for purchasing park benches and picnic tables as shown in the table below.
EPA's Recommended Recovered Materials Content Levels 
for Park Benches and Picnic Tables:

Product	Postconsumer Content(%)	Total Recovered Materials (Content %)
Plastics	90-100	100
Plastic composites	50-100	100
Aluminum	25	25
Steel	16
67	25-30
100


EPA's recommendations do not preclude a procuring agent from purchasing park benches and picnic tables made from other materials. They simply require that procuring agencies, when purchasing park benches or picnic tables made from plastic, aluminum, concrete, or steel, purchase these items made from recovered materials when these items meet applicable specifications and performance requirements. 

"Plastics" includes both single and mixed plastic resins. Park benches and picnic tables made with recovered plastics may also contain other recovered materials such as sawdust, wood, or fiberglass. The percentage of these materials contained in the product would also count toward the recovered materials content level of the item. 
The recommended recovered materials content levels for steel in this table reflect the fact that the designated items can be made from steel manufactured in either a Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) or an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). Steel from the BOF process contains 25-30% total recovered materials, of which 16% is post consumer steel. Steel from the EAF process contains a total of 100% recovered steel, of which 67% is post consumer. 

Installation consists of receiving, delivery from DFAS dock to cafeteria, setup including leveling, and trash removal. Any defective parts received will not be accepted and replaced within a reasonable time. All purchases are non taxable.


4.0  Invoicing Information:  Invoices shall be submitted to the COR/GPOC (Acceptor) as a 2-in-1 or Combo invoice via the internet using the Government provided Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) Receiving/Acceptance System at https://wawf.eb.mil.  (ref. clause 252.232-7003).  When the 2-in-1 or Combo invoice is received by the COR/GPOC via WAWF, the COR/GPOC will review the document and, if it is correct, accept it electronically and forward it for payment.  Web Base Training is available at www.wawftraining.com and for more information go to www.dod.mil/dfas and click the e-commerce link.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for an Analysis of Metal Contacts to Single Crystal Silicon Carbide Background: The NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is developing thermally stable ohmic metal contacts on single crystal silicon carbide as an enabling technology for applications in high temperature microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and electronics. The diffusion of oxygen from the outside and then through the metal to the contact interface with silicon carbide (SiC) generally leads to a catastrophic failure of the device. To prevent such from occurring during the operational life of the device, NASA GRC have demonstrated that the stack of Titanium/Tantalum Silicide/Platinum (Ti/TaSi2/Pt) metallization scheme provides excellent ohmic contact and diffusion barrier against oxygen penetration.  However, the long term reliability of the metallization contact to the SiC is still unknown. Specifications: The Contractor shall analyze SiC samples with the Ti/TaSi2/Pt metallization supplied by NASA GRC at various stages of annealing process.

9. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below 

GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR
 
Title: Police/Security Expert 

The police/security expert/contractor will work within the seven-person Haiti Stabilization Initiative (HSI) Reconstruction and Stabilization team at the United States Embassy in Port au Prince, Haiti, reporting to the program?s Stability Coordinator.  Although the position is located in the Embassy, it is in fact a field position.  It will require the contractor to spend at least two-thirds of the week in Cite Soleil.  
 
A U.S.-funded program, the HSI reports directly to the Ambassador, but
will coordinate with the UN Police, and will utilize the expertise of U.S. and other UN police personnel as appropriate, as well as that of the DEA, USAID, other USG agencies, and other donors and multilateral institutions. 

Context
 
Serial political crises in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere?s most persistent site of instability, have resulted in three U.S. military interventions in fifteen years at a cost of over $15 billion dollars.  Haiti?s fragile institutions and proximity to the U.S. exacerbate issues of narcotics trafficking and mass migration.  Organized crime and an epidemic of kidnapping have proliferated in urban slums.  The UN stabilization mission, MINUSTAH, has 7,000 military troops and is authorized 951 police, to keep the peace. Donors have pledged almost $1 billion to help Haiti recover economically, politically, and in terms of security.  Police are being trained, and progress is being made. 
 
Nevertheless, instability persists.  Nowhere are things worse than in the Port au Prince slum of Cite Soleil.  Gangs operate with impunity in an area that has been free of any kind of law enforcement.  Only in recent weeks have UN troops and police entered the zone to capture gang leaders.  Law-abiding citizens, particularly women and children, have been powerless in the face of lawlessness, without security or income.  

The HSI is premised on the idea that coordinated intervention now can prevent further deterioration of law and order, and future need for military intervention.  It is a separate program, a supplement to regular U.S. and international programs, designed to support the Haitian government?s overall national development strategy and develop its ability to govern in areas currently controlled by armed groups.  HSI will blanket Cite Soleil with programs and projects designed to improve security, generate economic activity, and increase the capacity of local governments to provide services in areas currently controlled by armed groups.  

USAID will carry out economic development programs and will train local governments.  The State Department, through the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), Office of Civilian Police and Rule of Law (INL/CIV), will work in the community to provide a context of security within which development efforts can be executed.  INL-supported activities may include refurbishing of police stations, provision of vehicles and communications equipment, and special training and mentoring of Haitian police to serve the community.  

Level of Effort
 
The position is full-time, with a minimum of 40-50 hours per week.

Guidelines

Guidance is provided from INL/CIV, State Department and Administration policies, directives and operating procedures regarding civilian police and peacekeeping, as well as by the terms of the UN peacekeeping mandate.  Since these guidelines provide only broad guidance, originality, resourcefulness and ingenuity are required to interpret, adapt and apply them to the complex needs of the failed-state environment in which the program operates.

Relationships

The contractor will report to the HSI Stability Coordinator, and coordinate with the INL Senior Police Advisor, the Deputy Police Advisor, the UN Police Commissioner, the Director General of the HNP, the Embassy security officer, and other donors and players as necessary.  Although there is not a direct reporting line from the contractor to the INL Senior Police Advisor, all activities of the contractor shall be cleared through the INL Senior Police Advisor.
 
Position elements

The incumbent will perform the following duties: 

?	Assist with development of the HSI security program development and recommendation of priorities for USG funding.
?	With consultation and coordination with MINUSTAH and other relevant actors, develop a plan for police to enter and gain acceptance within Cite Soleil.    
?	With the assistance of the Haitian National Police (HNP) and MINUSTAH, develop a selection process and select officers to receive specialized training in non-lethal weaponry, criminal investigation, counter-narcotics, community policing and conflict resolution.
?	Working with HNP Academy, participate in and monitor training and performance of officers in training.  Advise HNP concerning curriculum.  Coordinate with the judicial police special crimes unit and/or DEA. 
?	In consultation with INL/CIV, select U.S. trainers to provide training to selected officers.
?	Organize training of selected HNP teams to respond to emergency calls and investigate crimes.  Develop field training and/or mentoring programs.
?	Select and recommend appropriate equipment for HNP operating in Cite Soleil.
?	With HNP and community agencies, organize staffing patterns for Cite Soleil.
?	Consult with MINUSTAH for assignment of appropriate UNPOLs to mentor and provide field supervision within Cite Soleil. 
?	Work closely with the Stabilization team, as well as with other embassy personnel, reporting on relevant activities and issues in a timely manner.

The position as defined will only rarely require travel outside of Port au Prince.
 
Minimum Requirements

(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The objective is to pilot a demonstrations project, either a FEMA facility in Alabama or FEMA facility in Maryland to remotely retrieve utility meter information, report all necessary utility usage and costs, and other DHS required energy management information.   Monthly and quarterly the contractor will retrieve all of the required utility and energy management information; compile the information in a format that will be sent to DHS and FEMA; and annually report all energy management information to DHS and FEMA.  

3.  SCOPE
In order to comply with Executive Order 13423 (EO13423), DHS has mandated that all its components to report monthly, quarterly, and annually certain energy management information.  At the present time in order to comply with this DHS mandate, FEMA program office personnel must forward on a timely basis their utility invoices to the FEMA Policy and Oversight office.  The Policy and Oversight office in turn must review each utility invoice and prepare a spreadsheet with all the utility information.  Quarterly the Policy and Oversight office must submit to DHS the spreadsheet, along with other pertinent location use information. Other pertinent information would be, but not be limited to, energy audits, renewable energy projects, and disaster surge personnel or other increased usage at a location.
 
Currently FEMA has over one hundred and fifteen (115) utility meters at twelve (12) program offices throughout the continental United States.   This project will be a demonstration project for remote monitoring, processing of information of from between 30-50 meters. This number is expected to increase as certain proposed new FEMA locations come on line, and DHS also mandates that even disaster facilities, where FEMA pays the utilities, are required to report utility information. 

In a presentation at a DHS Energy Management Council meeting, DHS Energy manager discussed that numerous agencies use contractor support to meet E.O. 13423 and to provide remote monitoring and record development packages.

9.  Who will be responsible for missing tires or damaged axles from the original installation? 
            
The contractor performing the light deactivations will be responsible for missing tires or damaged axles.

10. Who will be responsible for removing personal items left by the occupant.....indoor and outdoor? 

The contractor performing the light deactivations will be responsible for removal of outdoor items as it applies to the obstruction of a unit.  IA-Housing or the department that is coordinating the move out inspections (MOI) will be responsible for the removal of indoor items.   

11. Will some of these units have bladders and if so what size and who is responsible for removing and disposal? 

The contractor performing the light deactivations will be responsible for the removal and disposal if a bladder exists.  The size of each bladder will vary.

12. Will another line item be issued to reflect the cost difference for transporting a travel trailer
vs. a mobile home?

Yes, additional CLINS will be added to provide for the transport of park models/mobile homes and travel trailers.

13. Will there be any bonding requirements for this contract?  

There are no bonding requirements for this contract.

14.  CLIN 0003
    
Each aspect of a deactivation is broken out into seperate CLINs.  The description of each of these CLINs references the "de-energizing" or "disconnecting" of power sources.  I presume that the reference in this description means the coordination of the LA One Call? 

The LA One Call deals with excavating and digging. This call has no bearing on the the de-energizing or disconnecting of power sources. 

CLIN 0003 "Utility Removal" states that the removal of power poles may be part of this requirement.  It has been our experience that it often takes up to several weeks for the utility companies to de-energize the power to a pole, often well after the unit has been removed from the property.  If we will be required to go back to the property to retrieve the pole after it has been deactivated, at what point precisely will this CLIN be considered completed and billable?

The CLINs are to be individually priced as each light deactivation may not require all CLINs.  Work will be considered billable upon completion of all work authorized and completed for each unit.

15.   Storage of Units and Materials    

Will units be delivered directly to a FEMA staging yard from the removal site or must they be cleaned (and possibly be stored briefly by us) prior to being accepted at FEMA staging? The need to maintain our own staging areas will obviously affect our pricing and possibly the areas for which we are able to bid the work.

Delivery will be made to a designated FEMA location; which will not be a staging yard.  FEMA will designate other, local sites to move units to in order to conduct a transfer of the unit to the applicant.  Any cleaning prior to removal will be performed by the Maintenance and Deactivation Contractor.

I understand that the actual transportation of units is to be bid on a per mile basis.  However, if units are to be delivered across state lines (e.g., into Mississippi), there are additional permits and insurance requirements which could affect our costs and therefore our pricing.  Will there be interstate lines crossed?

Units will not be delivered across state lines.

Also, what are we to do with the materials removed?  Though these materials technically belong to FEMA, we have been told not to bring them to FEMA staging for the current deactivations we are doing for other FEMA contractors.  Will we need to store these materials or discard them?  If we need to discard them, please advise as to any special requirements for their disposal (e.g., hazardous waste).

The materials removed shall be discarded in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and/or policies.

16.  INVOICING

Though broken out into seperate CLINs, all of the work to be performed in connection with deactivations really happens as part of one overall process, other than going back to retrieve the power pole after de-energization.  At what point/how frequently will we be permitted to invoice FEMA for this work?  Waiting for weeks to invoice and then to receive money from FEMA for this work creates a hardship when having to "float" the money to our independent contractors.  Is there any possibility of receiving some start up capital of help offset these expenses?

The CLINs are to be individually priced as each light deactivation may not require all CLINs.  Work will be considered billable upon completion of all work authorized and completed for each unit.  Phase-in costs are not being considered as part of this procurement, and any such expenses should be distributed into the firm-fixed price for each CLIN.

17.  Can I submit a proposal without certification under the stipulation that our company will be certified prior to award?

The company must be 8(a) certified at the time of proposal submission.

18. As an 8(a) Company who has partnered up with a company who is licensed in Mississippi and Louisiana are we able to bid on the two solicitations listed above?

Any partnering must be done with a firm that can be determined by preponderance of the evidence and pursuant to FAR 52.226-3 as residing or primarily doing business in Louisiana

<DESC>Response Date is changed to 7/23/2007 at 12:00 Eastern. Questions and answers: Q1. The SOW ask for MM 3.1 to 4.0 upgrade, please verify that you are request MM 1.1 to 3.1 upgrades (MM 3.1 is the current release)?  A1. We can word it to read 'the latest release'.  Sometimes a new version is available between the time the SOW is created and actual installation. Q2. Please verify that there exist two MM release 1.1 systems, one in St. Augustine and the other in Starke, FL?    A2. Correct.  The Saint Augustine site has two servers which act as one system and CBJTC has one server. Q3. Would you like us to also quote the Avaya SSU, Software Support and Upgrades, which provides remote engineer support and free upgrade software for 3 years? This would provide the MM 4.0 when available.  A3. We are only interested in one year support. Q4. For one MM system to be integrated with the two PBXs the integration will need to be T1/Q.SIG.  Is the existing switch integration at each site T1/Q.SIG?  A4. All three sites utilizing MM are under one PBX.  We used to have three PBX systems, but the last upgrade to the PBX combined all systems into one.   Q5. How Many ports in each MM system exist today?  A5. Voice Mail Domain 1 (located in saint Augustine) has 48 ports.  Voice Mail Domain 2 (located at CBJTC) has 24 ports. Q6. How many mailbox licenses exist in each system today?  A6. VMD1 has 300 license.  VMD 2 also has 300 licenses. Q7. What is the software release of the existing S8720 and S8500 Communication Managers in St. Augustine and the other in Starke, FL? A7. Both have Cm 3.0
