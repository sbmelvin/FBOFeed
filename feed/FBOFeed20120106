<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This Industry Day is for information and planning purposes only. This RFI does not constitute an invitation for Bids, Requests for Proposals, Solicitations, Requests for Quotes, or an indication that the Government will contract for the items contained in the RFI. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of information or reimburse expenses incurred by interested parties attending this Industry Day and/or one-on-one sessions.
BackgroundThe primary focus of this acquisition for the Air Force Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) program is a competitive effort for the development and delivery of airborne (E-4, E-6) and ground-based Command Post Terminals (CPT) with Presidential & National Voice Conferencing (PNVC) capability.  The terminals will provide for strategic nuclear and non-nuclear command and control (C2) using Extremely High Frequency (EHF), wideband, protected and survivable communications. The program will develop and field airborne, ground-fixed and ground-transportable terminals. They will be compatible with AEHF satellites and the legacy Milstar EHF satellite system and will leverage the increased capacity of the AEHF constellation.
FAB-T enables backward compatibility to existing Milstar EHF Low Data Rate (LDR) communications, operates with AEHF Extended Data Rate (XDR) satellites, and adds PNVC.  Terminal capabilities include transmission and reception of voice, data, imagery, and video over these protected SATCOM systems. The FAB-T terminals will ensure that nuclear C2 facilities remain connected to the President of the United States (POTUS), Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), and Combatant Commanders to provide positive control and nuclear surety of U.S. Nuclear Response forces.
The FAB-T Program Office plans to award up to two competitive, fixed price development/ production contract(s) for this effort.  The program requires initial delivery of terminals for integration into their respective platforms no later than the end of FY 2015 to meet user requirements.  The contract effort will develop and procure 84 terminals consisting of a mix of airborne and ground CPTs.  Options will be exercised for Low Rate Initial Production and subsequent Full Rate Production of the terminals. 
Industry Day InformationThe Air Force will post portions of the FAB-T Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) to the Hanscom Electronic RFP Bulletin Board (HERBB).  An Industry Day has been scheduled to seek industry feedback.
The FAB-T Program Office, Electronic Systems Center, ESC/HNT, will host the Industry Day Conference on 11 January 2012 from 10:00 AM to noon. Attendee in-processing will start at 9:00 AM. This Industry Day session will include a Government programmatic briefing followed by a question and answer session. The session will be held at The MITRE Corporation (M Building), 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730. Directions to MITRE and a MITRE map are attached.
The government plans to hold one-on-one technical discussions with potential prime contractors beginning at 1:00 PM on 11 January 2012 and continuing on 12 January 2012 at the MITRE facility. Firms requesting one-on-one technical discussions should contact the Contracting Officer at the email address provided below to request a time slot not to exceed two hours. 
Firms planning to attend Industry Day must RSVP via e-mail to FAB-T.Industry.Days@hanscom.af.mil no later than noon on 09 January 2012. Responses should include the company name and the full name(s) of company representative(s) planning to attend.

You may FAX or MAIL your request ATTN: CCAM-AR-A (Bldg 5300); Redstone Arsenal, AL; ATTN: Joseph Levasseur, Contract Specialist, Fax Number 256-313-8066.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  <br><br>The US Army Contracting Command-Redstone has a requirement for an eight month contract to be awarded in fiscal year 2012 for PBL Supplies/Services and Sustainment/Operational Support for the Shadow TUAS Program.  A letter contract award (W58RGZ-12-C-0011) with a period of performance of 1 Mar 12 - 31 Oct 12 (eight months) is anticipated.  The contract will be for a performance based Contractor Managed Supply and Maintenance effort that consists of field supply support, depot level supply support, depot-level maintenance, software support, total package fielding, sustainment training, field service support, field service operations, sustainment management, PBL engineering and management, depot material repair and management, and post deployment software support.  The Sustainment/Operational Support will consist of Brigade Integration Training, New Equipment Training, Presets, Resets, Government Owned Contractor Operated teams in theater, and contractor augmentation teams in theater.  <br><br>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 United States Code 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B).  The proposed acquisition of this effort is directly related to the ongoing and future work being performed by the Shadow prime contractor, AAI Corporation, York Road and Industry Lane, Hunt Valley, MD  21030, CAGE CODE 97384.  This requirement must be restricted for the following reasons: 1) AAI Corporation is the only source with the corporate knowledge, expertise, and facilities to execute all basic sustainment requirements for the Shadow TUAS Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program, 2) Many of the components of the Shadow TUAS are proprietary, and the Government does not currently own a Technical Data Package suitable for full and open competition, 3) The technology is state of the art and duplication of the effort would require lengthy development and would impact the Shadow TUAS readiness rate. <br><br>Firms that recognize and can provide the required PBL and Sustainment/Operational Support are encouraged to identify themselves.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement and proposal which shall be considered.  <br>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Aviation Safety Line of Business has a requirement for IOS 9001:2008 registrar support services.  Aerospace and transportation industry changes necessitate that the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) maintain a Quality Management System (QMS) that will enable the total organization to continually manage change that effectively improves safety oversight of the United States (U.S.) National Aerospace System (NAS).  The AVS organization is also deeply involved in the Agencies implementation of a Safety Management System (SMS) and the Next-Generation (NEXTGEN) air traffic control systems.  The AVS organization is composed of over 7000 people geographically distributed to over 150 locations that execute system, business and technical processes.  Having completed two (2) three-year cycles of registration and surveillance audits, AVS must now complete another recertification audit and surveillance audits to sustain the certificate.  In order to accomplish this goal, AVS requires the services of a qualified contractor to perform the required recertification audit and the subsequent surveillance audits.  The current contractor is ABS Quality Evaluation Inc, 16855 Northchase Drive, Houston, Texas 77060 under Contract No. DTFAWA-10-C-00031 which ends 04/01/2012.
The purpose of this survey is to gather information in order to determine whether there is adequate competition among small businesses and to choose the procurement method for this requirement.  If adequate competition is determined to exist among small businesses then the FAA may determine to set aside the requirement for competition among small businesses, if this cannot be determined based on the response to this market survey then the requirement will be open to all business sizes.  All questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed in writing to the Contracting Officer, Katherine M. Williams at katherine.m.williams@faa.gov.  Please see the attached market survey announcement and statement of work for more details.  Responses are due by 10am January 19, 2012 to katherine.m.williams@faa.gov.

<DESC>NASA/Johnson Space Center (JSC) has a requirement for critical performance datafrom an integrated flight test of the Orion spacecraft as part of the Orion MultipurposeCrew Vehicle (MPCV) Design, Development, Test and Evaluation (DDT&E) phase.   The Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) is an early flight test, planned for early 2014,of the Orion spacecraft that is currently being developed by Lockheed Martin SpaceSystems Corporation (LMSSC), Denver, Colorado under contract NNJ06TA25C.  The Orionspacecraft is a crew vehicle for missions beyond low-Earth orbit and will be launched onNASAs Space Launch System (SLS), which is expected to have a first flight in December2017.  The EFT-1 flight test of the Orion spacecraft is intended to facilitate earlier and morerobust testing of critical Orion spacecraft systems that contribute to 10 of the 16highest risks to crew survivability and exploration mission failure.  The requirements ofEFT-1 support early risk reduction of Orions critical systems by providing informationneeded for Loss of Crew (LOC) and Loss of Mission (LOM) assessments during an un-mannedtwo orbit, high apogee high-energy entry flight test.  This early orbital flight test iskey to providing early test data that is critical to influence design decisions andvalidate Orion spacecraft systems in flight environments that cannot be duplicated on theground.  Conducting this test before the Orion Critical Design Review mitigatesspacecraft DDT&E cost and schedule risks, and enables the final Orion spacecraft designto support the Exploration Mission 1 scheduled to occur in December 2017 on the SLS.EFT-1 flight test objectives are focused on demonstrating beyond low earth orbit (BEO)spacecraft capabilities.  The flight conditions required for EFT-1 were selected todemonstrate integrated vehicle performance for ascent, on-orbit flight, and a high-energyre-entry profile of approximately 30,280 feet per second from BEO. This trajectory willprovide two orbital revolutions with an inertial entry interface velocity of nearly 84%of lunar re-entry velocity to stress the entry, descent, and landing functions, includingthe heat shield, propulsion, guidance/navigation/control and parachute recovery systems. The flight test specifically will address risk mitigation of the largest contributors toLOC and LOM risks through demonstration of high energy re-entry performance determinationof the heatshield Thermal Protection System, Forward Bay Cover deployment and othercritical separation events, drogue and main parachute deployment, crew module up-rightingsystem deployment, and launch abort system (LAS) jettison.  Other objectives critical tomitigate development risk are demonstration of on-orbit control via the power, Guidance,Navigation and Control (GN&C) and reaction control systems, and the ground to spacecraftcommunications and tracking.  The test flight will incorporate specific elements andselected system capabilities that will provide critical integrated vehicle data to thesystems designers that otherwise would be unavailable until the planned December 2017fully integrated flight with NASAs SLS.To accomplish the EFT-1 objectives, NASA plans to expand the scope of the existing Orioncontract.  The EFT-1 flight test utilizes an early production variant of the Orionspacecraft which is comprised of four elements: the Orion launch abort system, crewmodule, service module, and spacecraft adapter and fairings.  The Orion contractor iscurrently developing these four elements under the existing contract.  The additionalscope required is to integrate the spacecraft with the launch system, along with otherunique integration efforts between this integrated stack and the ground and operationssystems.  The contractor also will be responsible for providing the launch service,including a launch vehicle capable of lifting the spacecraft into a highly lofted orbitto achieve the high energy reentry requirement.  The primary deliverable for this effortwill be the flight test data and engineering evaluation of the test results against theformal flight test objectives established by NASA.  NASA/JSC intends to procure this additional scope for the integrated flight test on asole-source basis from LMSSC, Denver Colorado, via a modification of the Orion contract. This decision is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no othersupplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, which implements the authority of10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  As the developer of the Orion spacecraft, LMSSC possesses the required technicalunderstanding of the integrated spacecraft design and its predicted responses in adynamic coupled environment with a launch system.  This knowledge is critical tounderstanding how both vehicles must work in unison during the flight phases of launch,on-orbit maneuvering and de-orbit return in order for the Orion spacecraft to accomplishand test the objectives of EFT-1.  LMSSC is uniquely positioned to assess prelaunchpredictions for integrated spacecraft/launch vehicle loads, thermal, flight control, andseparation dynamics, and then deconstruct the post-flight data for quick applicationtoward design/development updates to the Orion spacecraft.  Also, LMSSC is the only contractor with the systems level knowledge of the Orion designnecessary to perform the integrated systems analyses activity that will be required tointegrate the spacecraft with the launch system to meet the EFT-1 objectives.  Thesesystems analyses and integration activities are needed to mate the EFT-1 spacecraft witha launch system.  Further, a detailed understanding of the unique Orion spacecraftinterfaces and environmental drivers is required.  Issuance of this sole-source contractaction will permit NASA to accomplish its unique technical and schedule requirements forthe EFT-1 objectives.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon November 22, 2011.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the Government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<p class="MsoNormal">The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive, sole source basis with Dr. Frank Pierik PhD, Senior Researcher, The Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research, Postbus 80015, 3508 TA Utrecht, The Netherlands, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) &ndash; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal.<span>&nbsp; </span>All capability statements/proposals received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.<span>&nbsp; </span>A determination by the government not to compete the proposed contract upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.<span>&nbsp; </span>Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Generation R Study enrolled pregnant women and their partners and is following them and their children over time (Jaddoe et al., 2006; Jaddoe et al., 2008).<span>&nbsp; </span>Nearly all pregnant women in Rotterdam were eligible.<span>&nbsp; </span>Enrollment began in 2002 and ended in 2006.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nearly 10,000 pregnant women and their offspring were enrolled.<span>&nbsp; </span>Women in the study provided biologic specimens and completed questionnaires about themselves and their children, and in-person follow-up examinations take place on a regular basis.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Generation R Study has many specific goals, although the general <span style="color: black;">purpose of this study is to find causes of serious diseases among mothers and children</span>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">In February of 2004, NIEHS began supporting an increase in the number of urine specimens collected from each pregnant woman from 1 to 3 (at &lt;18, 18-25, and &gt; 25 weeks of gestation).<span>&nbsp; </span>As each pregnant woman presented for an ultrasound examination of her fetus, she provided a spot urine specimen that was divided into three 20 ml aliquots and frozen at -20 <sup>o</sup>C in polypropylene containers. Two of these aliquots are reserved for collaborative studies with NIEHS. <span>&nbsp;</span>Before NIEHS initiated collection of additional urine specimens, urine was collected only at the &lt;18 weeks of pregnancy (initial) study ultrasound visit.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the collection of additional urine specimens was implemented, all women presenting for their study ultrasound (at &lt;18, 18-25, and &gt;25 weeks of gestation) provided a urine specimen that was stored, regardless of whether urine specimens had been collected at earlier ultrasound visits.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, for Generation R Study subjects enrolled from February 2004 through January 2006, there exists a complete set of three (3) urines for 2,025 women, two (2) urines for 970 women, and one (1) urine for 356 women.<span>&nbsp; </span>The urine specimens collected with NIEHS support </span>can be used to assess the level of exposure to selected environmental contaminants and other compounds.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Generation R Study Management Team at Erasmus University governs the use of the samples and associated data.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As part of the Generation R Study in-person follow-up examination of children at age five (5)years, the examination will include: 1) the Berkeley Puppet Interview for children's self perceptions in six (6) domains (academic competence, achievement motivation, social competence, peer acceptance, depression-anxiety, and aggression-hostility); 2) the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-IV) for ADHD Diagnoses and other Clinical DSM Disorders; 3) an Autism Trait List (SCQ), administered by a child psychiatrist (in selected children after pre-screening on e.g. parent/teacher reported symptoms; and 4) an assessment of cognitive performance using both verbal intelligence and non-verbal intelligence testing (Dutch SON-R test).<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, examining levels of environmental contaminants, as measured in urine specimens, in relation to risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cognitive abilities, and other neuropsychiatric and behavioral abnormalities will be possible.<span>&nbsp; </span>The age five (5) follow-up is scheduled to end in 2011.<span>&nbsp; </span>The expected number of subjects who will have both three (3) urine specimens and in-person follow up is approximately 1,200, making the sample size much larger than existing studies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The ongoing work of the Generation R Study involves primarily three types of activities: a) follow-up of subjects and collection of specimens, b) specimen processing, storage, and management in support of research, and c) data processing, storage, and management in support of research.<span>&nbsp; </span>This requirement is not only to support continuation of the work in items b) and c), but also supports personnel and develops tools to enhance use of the samples and data by NIEHS, and collaboration with NIEHS.<span>&nbsp; </span>These personnel and tools include relationships and administrative procedures and support to facilitate: the development and evaluation of projects initiated at NIEHS; obtaining human subjects approval in the Netherlands for projects initiated at NIEHS; identification, pulling and shipping of specimens for specific studies; and responses to requests for various types of data.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The environmental studies based on the Generation R Study are coordinated by Dr. Frank Pierik, who is at TNO (<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN">Nederlandse</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN"> </span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN">Organisatie</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN"> </span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN">voor</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN"> </span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN">Toegepast</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN"> </span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN">Natuurwetenschappelijk</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN"> </span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN">Onderzoek, </span></strong><span lang="EN">or Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research)</span>, which is a separate organization from Erasmus University, where the Generation R Study is based.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 12pt 0in 6pt;"><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of this contract is to provide support for the ongoing work of the Generation R Study. This support would involve primarily three types of activities: a) specimen processing, storage, and management in support of research, b) data processing, storage, and management in support of research, and c) support of personnel and development of tools to enhance use of the samples and data by NIEHS, and collaboration with NIEHS.&nbsp; These personnel and tools include relationships and administrative procedures and support to facilitate: the development and evaluation of projects initiated at NIEHS; obtaining human subjects approval in the Netherlands for projects initiated at NIEHS; identification, pulling and shipping of specimens for specific studies; and responses to requests for various types of data.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Frank Pierik is uniquely qualified to perform the work under this contract due to his unique qualifications as coordinator of the environmental research projects based on the Generation R Study, and due to his direct access to the specimens stored at Star Medisch Diagnostic Centrum, Vlambloem 21, 3068 JE Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and direct access to the Generation R Study databases containing information on specimens, subject tracking, questionnaire responses, and the results of in-person examinations. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The anticipated period of performance is five (5) years beginning May 1, 2012 and ending April 30, 2017.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Patuxent River, MD intends to negotiate and award a contract modification on a sole source basis to Sikorsky Support Services Inc. to extend current support efforts under USN T-34/44/6 Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) contract number N00019-11-D-0014, which consists of tasking and equipment required for Organizational, Intermediate, and Depot-level aircraft maintenance and logistics. The resultant requirements type contract will cover performance up to 9 months (1 April 2012 - 31 December 2012) or for a period that will be determined at the discretion of the Navy, until performance begins on the competitively awarded T4/T44/T6 CLS contract (N00019-11-C-0056).
<p>There are approximately two hundred and seventy-three (273) T-34 aircraft. The T-34 is a single engine, two-place (tandem seat), unpressurized, low-wing, monoplane manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-34 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), FL, Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF), FL, and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi (NASCC), TX. The T-34 aircraft are also assigned to the following satellite sites to be used for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) projects, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and as competitive exercise observer platforms: NAS Lemoore, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; NAS Oceana, VA; NAF El Centro, CA; ATTC Fort Rucker, AL; Redstone Army Airfield, Huntsville, AL; NAWCAD Patuxent River, MD; Pope AFB Fayetteville, NC; NASA Cleveland, OH; NASA Edwards AFB, CA; and Fort Eustis, VA.</p>
<p>There are approximately fifty-four (54) T-44 aircraft. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are twin-engine, pressurized, fixed-wing, five-place monoplanes manufactured by Raytheon Aircraft Company. The T-44A and T-44C aircraft are identical in airframe and propulsion, but the T-44C avionics have been upgraded to an integrated digital cockpit. The T-44 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi.</p>
<p>There are approximately forty-two (42) T-6A aircraft and twenty (20) T-6B aircraft. The T-6A/B aircraft are single-engine, two-place (tandem seat), pressurized, low-wing, monoplanes manufactured by Hawker Beechcraft Corporation. Both aircraft are powered by a PT6A-68 free turbine turboprop engine, flat rated at 1100 shp, manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Each aircraft is equipped with two Martin-Baker US16LA ejection seats and On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS). The T-6 is the replacement aircraft for the T-34C. The T-6 aircraft is assigned to CNATRA for various missions at Naval Air Station Pensacola (NASP), Naval Air Station Whiting Field (NASWF) and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi. The T-6 aircraft are also assigned to satellite sites (noted above for T-34), to be used for RDT&amp;E, production integration testing, range clearance and coordination, tactical strike observations, pilot proficiency, and competitive exercise observer platforms.<br /><br />NAVAIR intends to award this T-34/44/6 CLS effort to Sikorsky Support Services Inc. of Pensacola, Fl, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements). To mitigate the risk that performance on the competitive follow on contract could be delayed until 31 December 2012, award of a sole source contract to the current performing contractor is necessary in order to continue to meet CNATRA's training mission. A gap of CLS support would result in a negative impact to Naval Aviation readiness.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.

<SUBJECT>Probabilistic Risk Assessment Modeling Support for the Full-Scope Site Level 3 PRA Project
<SOLNBR>RES-12-066
<RESPDATE>012012
<CONTACT>Claudia G. Melgar, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014923487, Email Claudia.Melgar@nrc.gov - Adelis M. Rodriguez, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-492-3623, Fax 301-492-3437, Email adelis.rodriguez@nrc.gov
<DESC>A full-scope site Level 3 probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) for a nuclear power plant site can provide valuable insights into the relative importance of various risk contributors by assessing accidents involving one or more reactor cores as well as other site radiological sources (i.e., spent fuel pools and dry storage casks). These insights can be used to further enhance regulatory decision-making and to help focus limited agency resources on issues most directly related to the agency's mission to protect public health and safety.
<p>A full-scope site Level 3 PRA is a complex model that consists of many technical aspects. Each aspect of the PRA must be adequately developed so that the entire PRA may serve its intended function. Some of these technical aspects include, but are not limited to, initiating event analysis, event tree development and analysis, system reliability model (e.g., fault tree) development and analysis, human reliability analysis, data analysis, accident sequence quantification, and uncertainty analysis. A PRA is considered to be full-scope when the technical aspects are adequately developed for all major hazard groups (e.g., internal fire, internal flooding, seismic) and low power and shutdown modes of reactor operation. Additionally, a site PRA is considered to include the risk contributions from initiating events that impact more than one unit at the site; the impact of accidents at one unit on any other units at the site; and non-reactor sources of radiological material, such as spent fuel pools and dry storage casks.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE TO ABIOMED FOR
PREVENTATIVE MAINTENACE FOR THE AB5000 SYSTEM
VISN 20, VA Puget Sound Healthcare System (VAPSHC), Tacoma WA, 98493 intends to negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract and will utilize procedures under FAR Part 13, with Northwest Association for Biomedical Research, 100 W Harrison St, North Tower, Suite 430, Seattle, WA 98119.  It is intended that this procurement will be sole source per 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (3) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(3) & FAR 6.302-1), only one responsible source.

A Veterans Health Administration (VHA) initiative is to conduct animal and human subject research in order to develop new ways of patient care.   Most VHA Primary Care practices have already adopted many features of patient centered care and the medical home, but complete achievement will involve strategic assessment and redeployment of resources, realignment of priorities, and a cultural shift.  This effort will be transformative and will align VA with national health care reform initiatives, enable us to continue to provide leadership in health care delivery, and assure that our Veterans' health continues to be managed with the highest quality, safety and effectiveness.   
VISN 20, VA Puget Sound Healthcare System (VAPSHC) intents to contract with Northwest Association for Biomedical Research for the purpose of providing Biomedical Research Professional Organizational Membership.  Their ability to provide professional development training and address topics and concerns within a published media on areas of study of animal and human subject research is unique within the marketplace and essential to VAPSCHC to provide high quality, continued care.  Because of the scope and requirements it is imperative to our success that we utilize the unique services of Northwest Association for Biomedical Research.  
This notice of intent is not a request for proposals or quotations. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether conducting a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government in the future. Interested parties may identify their capabilities by responding to this requirement and considered for future reference. All information submitted should support the capability to provide the services needed, and shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses must be in writing and must provide clear and concise documentation indicating a bona fide capability to provide the required service. Responses may be submitted via email to scott.eberle@va.gov no later than 12 January 2012.

2.  Contract Title.  Remove or push back snow that ground department is unable to remove due to lack of adequate equipment.

3.  Background.  
VA engineering department doesn't own equipment needed to move large and heavy amounts of plowed snow. We need to be able to have snow removed or pushed back so we are prepared to plow snow after area snow storms and in the past have had to do multiple credit card purchases, one each after heavy snow fall occurrences.  This contract will allow grounds staff to call in outside contractors to remove snow on an as needed basis and eliminate any potential of perceived split credit card orders.
4.  Scope. 

Remove or push back snow for the FY2011 snow season on an as-needed, call-in basis not to exceed $10,000.

5. Specific Tasks.  

Once the snow levels around the VA Hospital Spokane ground areas exceed the amount that can be reasonably moved with facility existing equipment, contractor will be directed to come and either remove or push back plowed snow berms.  Response time for snow plowing/removal will be within 3 business days of contact by the VA and the contractor will work diligently until all snow has been adequately pushed back or removed (as indicated by caller), so that VA grounds crews have room for plowing during the next snow storm.  Work may require some evening or early morning work to access parking lots that might otherwise be in use.  It is recommended but not required the contractor remove snow during times of low volume parking at the VA hospital.  Typically these times are evening and during weekends.  Keep in mind the Government will normally estimate the hours required for removal of snow as being accomplished during these times to maximize efficient and timely snow removal operations.

Work hours to complete snow removal will be agreed upon by contractor and Government PRIOR to work start.  Contractor WILL NOT exceed agreed upon hours to work for each call.  Exceeding agreed upon and established work hours DOES not obligate the government and is SOLELY the risk of the contractor.   Contractor will provide description of equipment they intend to use prior to job.  This will facilitate an accurate estimate of hours required.    Contractors will also include a description of equipment the contractor intends to use for the duration of the agreement.  


Normally the contractor will only be required to PUSH back or move snow to a location on the VA campus.  At times the Government may request the contractor remove snow from the VA campus area.  

Work will ONLY be directed by an authorized caller appointed by the contracting officer.

<DESC>The USDA, ARS, US Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) in Clay Center, Nebraska is conducting market research for a backup and recovery system for servers and network storage at the location.  The MARC computing infrastructure is typically multi-vendor and UNIX based.  MARC is a government scientific research facility that has a broad research program in animal agriculture and includes significant programs in DNA sequencing, genomics and bioinformatics.
<p>It is intended that this market research will generate procurements within the next 30 days.  Proposals and quotes from vendors are welcome.  Proposals should be received by Friday, 20 January 2012.  Proposals should mention federal contracts or designations in effect, such as GSA contracts, SEWP contracts, or 8(a) status.</p>
<p>Proposals should include both hardware and software.  Hardware should have a 3-year, next business day on-site response.  Software should include technical support and product update rights for 3 years.</p>
<p>Network attached storage at MARC consists of Isilon X200 (approximately 50 TB) , EMC VNX 5100 (approximately 10 TB), an Apple X-RAID system and several UNIX servers with internal storage.  A Sun server has a StorageTek 6140 array (approximately 14 TB).  Two HP-Red Hat Linux servers host two Oracle 11g databases.  Total storage capacity is currently less than 100 TB.  The Isilon storage is expected to grow somewhat rapidly, perhaps double in two years.  Other storage will have modest growth.  Proposals should be able to accommodate this growth.  Proposals that allow incremental growth to the backup system will be viewed favorably.</p>
<p>The Isilon storage will contain a significant number of large files from DNA sequencers that never change.   Thus, some type of archive or near-line storage may be of interest.  Tape backups are currently used, but disk-to-disk backup is of interest.  Deduplication software is of interest.</p>
<p><br />Proposals may be emailed to Ms. Donita Furman, Purchasing Agent, Donita.Furman@ars.usda.gov, (402) 762-4145.</p>
<p>We welcome opportunities to discuss products and configurations with vendors through video conference, teleconference, web meetings, or on-site visits.  Questions may be addressed to either:</p>
<p>Jim Wray, Jim.Wray@ars.usda.gov , (402) 762-4158<br />Randy Bradley, Randy.Bradley@ars.usda.gov, (402) 762-4156</p>

<DESC>***THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION***The US Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division on behalf of the United States Marine Corps Systems Command(MARCORSYSCOM) is requesting information on a modernized tray ration heating system. The legacy tray ration heating system was first fielded in 1996. That system is nearing the end of its service life and the obsolescence of the current prime mover requires the development of a materiel solution to replace the currently fielded system. The legacy system comprised a 30 gallon tank that was heated with a JP 8 fired burner and all of the accessories required<br>to feed Marines in a tactical environment using the Unitized Group Ration Heat&Serve (UGR H&S)components.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC)-New Jersey located at Fort Dix, NJ 08640, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS) is conducting market research to identify potential sources that are capable of supplying the FMU 160/B High Fragmentation Proximity Fuze (HFF) with Point Detonating (PD) backup used in 105mm HF Artillery Projectiles on U. S. Air Force Special Operations gunships.The FMU 160/B fuze will be purchased on behalf of the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).  The fuze/projectile will be fired from a modified M137 105mm cannon that is mounted in the AC-130 Gunship. The Government anticipates soliciting offerors for award of a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to deliver to the United States Air Force FY13-FY17 Tactical Fuzes production requirements. It is anticipated that a single IDIQ contract will be awarded for a basic period of five years. The NAICS code for this requirement will likely be 332993. All respondents to this market survey should show they have certification to receive export-controlled technical data (including drawings restricted by Distributions Statement D) and must have facilities with sufficient safety clearance to handle hazard classifications (i.e. 1.2D). In addition, this requirement is subject to Distribution D Authority and under this market survey no technical data packages shall be provided.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC)-New Jersey located at Fort Dix, NJ 08640, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (OPM-CAS) is conducting a market research to identify potential sources that are capable of supplying the FMU-153/B Point Detonating (PD)/Delay Fuze used in 105mm High Explosive (HE) Artillery Projectiles.The FMU-153/B fuze may be set for either PD or Delay depending on the type of target. In the PD mode the fuze may be used against soft targets or for registration on hard targets. In the Delay mode the fuze may be used against hard targets where penetration is desired. The FMU-153/B fuze is basically the same as the MK399 MOD1, except for a heavier nose section, for use in Air Force 105mm weapons against Air Force ground targets. The FMU 153/B PD/Delay fuze is a combination of two (2) proven fuze designs: The MK399 MOD1 and the MK407 MOD1 PD/Delay fuzes. The combination is the packaging of the internal components from the MK407 MOD1 into the body of the MK399 MOD1. The repackaging was direct and simple since the cavities in the fuze bodies are the same dimensions. Therefore, there was no need to redesign parts or closing screws due to size changes. There were minor design changes to the Safe Arming Mechanism to reflect the Army's arming requirement. These changes removed two (2) gear teeth from the sector gear and weakened the spin lock springs. This would facilitate arming the fuze at 400 calibers from the weapon at all spin rates observed from the weapon.The Government anticipates soliciting offerors for award of a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to deliver to the United States Air Force FY13-FY19 Tactical Fuze production requirements. It is anticipated that a single IDIQ contract will be awarded for a basic period of five years with an option that may be exercised to extend each contract for an additional two year period. The NAICS code will likely be 332993.All respondents to this market survey should show they have certification to receive export-controlled technical data (including drawings restricted by Distributions Statement D) and must have facilities with sufficient safety clearance to handle hazard classifications (i.e. 1.2D). In addition, this requirement is subject to Distribution D Authority and under this market survey no technical data packages shall be provided. REQUIREMENTS: The minimum FMU-153/B PD/Delay Fuze order expected in any one year will be no less than 6,000 fuzes up to a maximum quantity of 55,000 Fuzes for each ordering period.Interested contractors should demonstrate that they possess the experience, capability, necessary equipment, facilities and tooling required, or that they can obtain such, necessary to fabricate, assemble, test and inspect the required quantities of Tactical Fuzes per the requirements identified above.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH and HUMAN SERVICES<br />Health Resources and Services Administration<br />Healthcare Systems Bureau<br />Division of Transplantation<br />Request for Information Concerning the Contract for the Operation of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN).
<p>AGENCY: Division of Transplantation, Healthcare Systems Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration, United States Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>ACTION: Request for Information (RFI) from the public.</p>
<p>SUMMARY: This RFI is for planning purposes only; this is not a request for Quotations or Proposals. No solicitation document exists. The Government will not be liable for payment of any response preparation expenses.</p>
<p>This notice is a request for information from the public concerning input on a future proposal to operate the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), the Nation's organ procurement and transplantation system. The current OPTN contract expires at the end of September 2012. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is seeking this public comment to assist HRSA is developing the request for proposals to award a new contract for the continued operation of the OPTN.</p>
<p>The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, as amended, requires the OPTN to be operated under contract with a private non-profit entity with expertise in organ procurement and transplantation. The OPTN is a well-functioning national system that facilitates life saving transplants for thousands of patients each year. With this RFI, HRSA is seeking information about whether any changes should be made to the statement of work to enhance or improve existing processes and operations of the OPTN.</p>
<p>HRSA is seeking comments and recommendations on the effectiveness of the scope of the current contract in supporting the operation of the OPTN and in meeting the needs of the patients that are served by the system. In this regard, HRSA is seeking comments about the operations and processes of the OPTN and not the specific policies of the OPTN. Issues of interest to HRSA include: response to the need to update allocation and other OPTN policies; access to the deliberations and policy making process of the OPTN; available information to the public and other interested stakeholders about the mission and operation of the OPTN; and assistance to OPTN members in continuous performance improvement of transplant programs and organ procurement organizations.</p>
<p>HRSA is also seeking comments from stakeholders on whether or not the operation of the OPTN would be improved if certain tasks or elements of tasks were done by entities under subcontract with the prime OPTN contractor. Consistent with contracting principles and applicable law, the OPTN contract could be operated exclusively by a single contractor satisfying the statute's requirements (i.e. a private nonprofit entity with the required expertise) or by such a contractor who ensures that certain contract requirements are performed by subcontractors. HRSA is seeking comments from the public about which contract tasks coould be performed by the prime contractor and which contract tasks could be performed by a subcontractor with specialized expertise (e.g., information systems engineering and management, media relations, public and professional education, continuity of operations, operations management, travel and logistics management, etc.) and whether and how such sub-contracting arrangements might enhance the performance and efficiency of the OPTN. HRSA may accept, but will not require, that any entity submitting a proposal to serve as the OPTN Contractor fulfills contractual requirements through such subcontracting arrangements.</p>
<p>Attached is the statement of work (SOW) for the expiring contract. It explains, among other things, that the OPTN Contract is and has been a cost sharing contract. As with previous contracts, the next contract will be awarded using a competitive contracting process. While many of the elements of the SOW are mandated by law, HRSA is open to assessing and revising existing requirements. In addition, the new statement of work may include, but may not be limited to, the following new provisions and expansions of existing provisions to address evolving requirements and developments in the field of organ donation, procurement, and transplantation:</p>
<p>1) Kidney Paired Donation. The OPTN is currently conducting a national pilot project to determine the benefit provided to patients by a national system of kidney paired donation (KPD). This pilot project <br />matches living donors and their intended candidates with other living donor/intended candidate pairs when it is determined that the living donors cannot donate to the persons they initially hoped would receive their kidneys. A forthcoming SOW may address the possibility of converting the pilot project into a permanent component of the OPTN to be offered as an option to appropriate candidates and will potentially create a large national pool of living donors and their intended candidates for matching with other donor/candidate pairs.</p>
<p>2) Enhanced public involvement in the OPTN policy-making process, including: OPTN member nominations, opportunities for broader participation of transplant constituencies and the public in OPTN meetings, and increased opportunities for comment from patients, families, transplant recipients, living donors, and the general public.</p>
<p>3) Expanded policy compliance and monitoring for transplant recipient and living donor safety and disease transmission.</p>
<p>4) Expanded role for the OPTN in educating the transplant community and the public on transplant safety and disease transmission information gained through the OPTN. This may include regular reporting on this information to the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation.</p>
<p>5) Expanded research capacity to support informed OPTN policy development, including operations research, failure analysis, economic impact analysis, and forecasting behavioral changes related to OPTN policy changes. Simulation modeling related to proposed changes to OPTN organ allocation policies would remain the responsibility of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR).</p>
<p>6) Increased ability of the OPTN's data system to quickly utilize advancements in information technology to improve the organ allocation system. Given the pace of advancement in this area, the OPTN system should be poised to incorporate advancements that will increase the efficiency and safety of organ allocation. Examples may include, but are not limited to, bar coding, tracking capabilities, and incorporation of uniform international classification schemes.</p>
<p>To be considered, comments or suggestions for changes must be postmarked, if mailed, or transmitted, if e-mailed, by Friday, February 17, 2012.</p>
<p>Comments may be mailed to Mario Checchia,&nbsp;Contract Specialist, Health Resources and Services Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A-43, Rockville, Maryland 20857 or e-mailed to mchecchia@hrsa.gov. Please submit only one copy of your comments by only one method. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. Electronic submissions, where possible, are encouraged to reduce expense. We recommend that responses be clear, concise, and to the point. Responses should not exceed 20 pages. Responses must be double-spaced and single-sided on 8.5" x 11" plain white paper, pages sequentially numbered, with 1" margins on all side, using a standard font no smaller than 12 point.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), INVITATION FOR BID (IFB), REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ), REQUEST FOR APPLICATION (RFA) OR AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT ASSUME THE GOVERNMENT WILL AWARD A CONTRACT OR PROCEED WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE TYPES OF SOLICITATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.</p>

The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.

Expired units may be retained aboard indefinitely; this retention enables the SMT to provide a more cost effective and timely recertification regimen.<br />Note: Refer to manufacturer's technical manual for detailed description.<br />01.Inspect and replace the wire rope for the following signs of damage or deterioration. <br />a. Abrasions, corrosion, scrubbing, flattening or peening causing loss of more than 1/3 of the diameter of the outside individual wires. <br />b. Evidence of heat damage from a torch or contact with electrical wires.<br />c. Reduction from original diameter of 0.0156in <br />d. More than one broken wire (this could mean that non-visible wires are fatigued or broken).<br />e. Six randomly distributed broken wires in one rope lay or three broken wires in one strand within one rope lay. <br />Replace if any of the above are found.<br />02. Lubricate the wire rope often to prevent rust. Use a penetrating corrosive resistant lubricant to ensure that the core remains lubricated.<br />03. Inspect the tension holder rollers.<br />a. Remove the wing nut from the locking cam and remove the pin and cam from the assembly.<br />b. Pull the roller assembly away. <br />c. Examine the four rollers for deep grooves or flat spots.<br />d. Spin each roller to make sure the bearings are free and properly lubricated.<br />e. If no further service is required, reassemble the roller. Install the cam so the roller tightens on the wire rope when the handle is pushed down.<br />04. Inspect the wire rope drum and automatic emergency brake.<br />a. Remove the inspection plate on the drum flange opposite the transmission. The brake disc is visible inside.<br />b. Move the disc back and forth to make sure it moves freely. As the brake plate is turned in one direction, it will move laterally toward the bearing housing. When released, it should automatically return to its seated position and it should be about 1/16 in away from the bearing housing when seated. Use the inspection hole cover as a feeler gauge, but be sure to clean it of excess paint or contaminates first. Be sure to replace the cover and gasket with the two screws when the inspection is completed.<br />c. Inspect the seal between the bearing housing and the cable drum to make sure it is in place. Inspect the locknut on the end of the drum shaft to see that it is in place and secure.<br />05. Inspect the wire rope level wind system<br />a. Inspect the drum base for damage. <br />b. Check the two pivot pins for wear and make sure they are properly secured with the snap rings.<br />c. Check the tilt control spring assembly to ensure that it resists the tilting of the drum. <br />d. If the drum base or tilt control spring assembly need service, contact your local Spider representative.<br />06. Inspect the oil level in both sections of the transmission through the inspection hole. If the level is below the hole, fill with Mobil SHC 634 cylinder oil. Use no substitutes. At the same time inspect the bronze gear. The width of a new gear tooth is approx. 1/16 in. If the edge of the tooth is getting sharp, replace the gears. Contact your local Spider representative.<br />07. Test the overload switch<br />a. With all the wire rope stored neatly on the drum and the free end rigged to a beam of adequate strength, load the staging with the rated working load as shown on the load rating plate.<br />b. When connected to a proper voltage or air supply, the staging should lift the load.<br />c. With the addition of another 100lbs, the overload shut-off should prevent upward travel of the stage.<br />08. Test motor control switch<br />a. With the proper power supply connected to the stage, operate the switch in both directions and make sure the drum turns in the correct direction. Be sure to keep the wire rope from going slack on the drum when doing this.<br />b. Examine the handle and control assembly to make sure it is secured and not damaged in a way that would prevent correct use.<br />NOTE: If fitted with an air hoist go to step 11. of this procedure, otherwise continue from step 9.<br />09. Inspect the electric hoist solenoid brake.<br />a. Disconnect the supply cord then remove the brake cover.<br />b. Examine the brake lining for wear. The lining is approximately 3/16in thick when new. When the lining measures 3/32in or less, replace the lining.<br />c. Push the solenoid plunger down. The brake shoes should just release the drum. Keep the plunger and frame seating surfaces and the air gap clean - dirty surfaces cause solenoid noise and possible failure. The plunger gap should be 1/2in.<br />d. Replace the cover and connect the supply cord.<br />e. Operate the switch and listen for the click of the solenoid. If a distinct buzzing sound comes from the solenoid when energized, the plunger is not seating properly and could cause the solenoid to burn out.<br />f. If the primary brake assembly needs repair, contact your Spider representative.<br />10. Inspect the stage power supply.<br />a. Examine the plugs on the stage and the supply cord to make sure that they are correct NEMA standard for the voltage being supplied. The plugs should be the correct voltage and be rated 20 amps for GE and 15 amps for DYNA motors.<br />b. Examine the plugs and rubber boots for any signs of damage that might prevent correct use.<br />c. Use as short a supply cord as necessary. Use wire no smaller than 10 gauge.<br />d. Always connect the supply cord to a good source of voltage and make sure it is protected by a 20 amp fuse or circuit breaker. Make sure that no other machines are drawing from the same supply. This may cause a motor to burn out due to voltage fluctuations.<br />e. Check voltage and current at the control while the motor is running and lifting its maximum intended load. Voltage should not vary from rated voltage by more than 10% - a 10% reduction in voltage results in a 20% loss of power. Large voltage fluctuations can cause the motor to burn out. Keep wire rope length at a minimum if a low voltage condition exists that cannot be easily remedied.<br />11. Inspect air hoist filter by removing and cleaning the filter screen.<br />Military Sealift Fleet Support Command (MSFSC) requires the Contractor to accomplish an inspection and certification of Spider Man Service Lifts at the contractor's facility. The Contractor shall submit an as found condition report listing required parts and recommended repairs to the Port Engineer The Contractor shall upon completion of all tests, and inspections complete all required documentation and shall provide Submit (2 copies) of certification report to include all repairs made, parts replaced and weight testing results to the Port Engineer and two copies to the ship.</p>
<p>Spider Lift certification is valid for a period of one year and every MSC vessel needs to have lift overhaul certifications performed annually per Safety Management Systems (SMS) requirements.<br />Sources may be large or small business concerns. <br />The appropriate NAICS Code is 811310 and size standard is $7.0M.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. ALL POTENTIAL OFFERORS SHALL REFER TO THE ATTACHMENT FOR THE DRAFT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201. The Government does not intend to award a contract from this announcement or to otherwise pay for information solicited, but is seeking information on available source, i.e., various GSA schedule providers, including the use of GSA Schedule 70 as the acquisition approach, government service providers and all other industry sources capable of providing the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Integrated Mission System (IMS)/ Document Management System (DMS) supplies/services under this RFI. SCOPE. The Commission intends to procure seven Hewlett-Packard (HP) servers and one enterprise disk storage array, as a brand name decision off General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule 70. Understanding that procuring specific brand name items (i.e. HP) requires due diligence by the Government, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is issuing this RFI to assess the availability of the product in the supply market. BACKGROUND. The EEOC's enforces the federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. We perform this function through a geographically dispersed organizational structure: a headquarters (HQ), located in Washington, DC, and 53 field offices located throughout the domestic United States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Of the EEOC's approximate 2,400 employees, approximately 450 are employed in HQ with the remaining employees located in the field offices. Information technology (IT) is centralized within the EEOC, under the HQ Office of Information Technology (OIT). OIT maintains a single data center at the HQ location, which centrally hosts the Commission's core information systems. As a small agency with limited resources, EEOC has standardized our infrastructure on HP-brand equipment. During FY 2011, we acquired approximately 74 new HP servers to refresh our file/print/e-mail servers at Headquarters and all field locations, and 6 new HP application servers; bringing our total inventory to approximately 168 HP servers. EEOC will now be refreshing 15 of our older application servers with 7 newer models and acquiring one enterprise storage disk array to compliment an existing HP Storage Area Network. The brand name decision is being considered so that the equipment is compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with the existing infrastructure and backup solutions and so that parts and components are interchangeable and certified for use with the existing components. See attachment for Hardware/Software Requirements and Management Requirements. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Industry is requested to provide their estimated cost involved in providing the required IMS/DMS supplies/services to EEOC. Questions should be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer on or before the close of business (COB) Thursday, January 12, 2012. Responses to the RFI are due by Friday, January 27, 2012 at 3:00 p.m. local time.<br />

This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to solicit responses from interested suppliers to determine which are capable of providing the potential services described.</em></strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="left">The U.S. Postal Service announced, in September 2011, a number of proposals designed to significantly reduce its operational costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One proposal under consideration is a study to redesign the mail processing and transportation network.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This study may result in consolidation of processing centers from 461 mail processing facilities to approximately 200 facilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="left">As a part of the review and planning stage, it is important to understand the sources available in the transportation and distribution industries that can meet the potential future demands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this sources sought notice is to solicit responses from interested suppliers to determine which are capable of providing potential transportation management services to the U.S. Postal Service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="left">If the Postal Service moves forward with the consolidation, the suppliers may be required to route trucks to transport mail from processing and distribution centers to post offices within a broad service area. The supplier also may be required to provide a cross-dock distribution hub between facilities to consolidate mail for distribution to down stream offices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The service requirements will include the critical entry times (CETs) and dispatch of value (DOV) times for processing and distribution centers (P&amp;DCs), Mailers, and the Administrative Offices (AOs).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The day-by-day estimated volume of mail to be transported also will be provided as a tool for the suppliers to determine the labor and vehicle requirements for the service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>S<span style="COLOR: black">uppliers may be required to load and unload vehicles when requested by postal officials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="left">The number and type of vehicles required will be determined by the suppliers based on the estimated volumes in the future service requirements. The suppliers will be required to have readily available sufficient stand-by equipment to perform all transportation requirements, to permit vehicle maintenance, and to prevent delays in emergencies such as mechanical failures and poor weather conditions.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="left">In December 2011, the U.S. Postal Service agreed to delay the closing or consolidation of any Post Office or mail processing facility until May 15, 2012. The Postal Service will continue all necessary steps required for the review of these facilities during the interim period, including public input meetings.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="left">With that said, pending managerial approval to move forward with consolidations, the U.S. Postal Service plans to pre-qualify suppliers based on a geographical area and a maximum contract dollar value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The geographical areas likely will be national, regional, or local.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>National would be across all Postal Service Areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Regional level would be within a Postal Service geographical area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Local level would be defined as within a reasonable distance of the processing facility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There may also be different dollar values associated with the prequalification (e.g., contract awards up to $250,000-$499,999, $500,000-$999,999, $1,000,000-$4,999,999, $5,000,000-$10,000,000, above $10,000,000).</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: left" align="left">Suppliers interested in and capable of providing the potential services identified must register on our eSourcing tool [<a href="https://uspsesourcing.emptoris.com/sso/jsp/login.jsp"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">https://uspsesourcing.emptoris.com/sso/jsp/login.jsp</span></a>] where details of the prequalification opportunity are <span style="COLOR: black">available. Once the supplier's&nbsp;eSourcing application has been approved and training for using the tool is completed, the supplier must send an email to the address below indicating that they would like to participate in the prequalification event, and the supplier will be invited. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This event will close on March 2, 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There may be future prequalification events for suppliers who wish to submit applications after March 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Postal Service will</span> hold two supplier informational conferences on the prequalification process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first conference is scheduled to be held at the Golden Nugget Hotel, 136 Fremont Street, St. Andrews Room, Las Vegas, NV, on January 25, 2012.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another conference will be held at Postal Headquarters, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Washington, DC, on February 23, 2012. For the February 23rd event, interested suppliers may attend via Webinar as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To register and receive the details on the informational conferences, suppliers should submit their company name, contact name, telephone numbers, and email addresses to:</p>

<DESC>This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all information received within fifteen days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District, is conducting a market survey to identify sources for EDR equipment that will produce 92% water recovery rate for treatment of groundwater with the below given raw and treated water quality requirements.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District, anticipates a future procurement for the Ft. Irwin, CA FY-12 Water Treatment and Distribution System design and construction activities including but not limited to a 6.0 million gallons per day (MGD) or 22,700 cubic meters per day (m3D-1) 3 stage, EDR water treatment plant.  The Plant will treat all contaminants found in Fort Irwin's ground water in accordance with (IAW) federal and state and DoD requirements (i.e.: arsenic, fluoride, and total dissolved solids). The Plant will include an Electro-Dialysis Reversal (EDR) system as primary treatment. The project also includes the construction of the EDR facility with pumps, EDR stacks, filters, and an EDR waste equalization tank. The Plant includes treatment of the waste stream from the EDR using lime softening clarifiers, lime solids thickeners, lime sludge lagoons, reverse osmosis (RO) filters, brine treatment facility, concentrate equalization basins and a mechanical evaporator (ME) tower and feed tank, and 3 evaporation ponds. The project includes supporting utilities and infrastructure upgrades to the water plant and water distribution system. <br><br>As part of the project design, electro-dialysis reversal (EDR) membrane equipment will be required to meet 92% water recovery to meet all federal, state, and DoD water quality requirements.  The new EDR equipment is required to not exceed a total of four EDR units to treat 6 MGD water to meet the specified minimum amount of water recovery of 92% for initial primary treatment (with one additional unit for redundancy for a total of five units).   Treatment in accordance with outlined goals has been proven with GE Aquamite pilot units and full scale design modeling in which three stages per EDR unit are anticipated to achieve the percent recovery for the initial raw water with each unit containing 24 stacks for a total of 120 stacks in the treatment system.<br><br>Source Water Quality Constituents and Fort Irwin Drinking Water Quality Goals for the 6 mgd Water Treatment Plant  <br>Constituent	Unit	Source Water <br>Quality Projections	Federal MCl	California MCl	Fort Irwin  Drinking Water  <br>Quality Goal<br> As  	  g/L  	 40  	 10  	 10  	 7.5  <br> F  	 mg/L  	 6  	 4  	 2  	 1.6  <br> Fe  	 mg/L  	 0.675  	 0.3  	 0.3  	 0.225  <br> TDS  	 mg/L  	 700  	 500-1 ,000  	 500-1,000  	 500-1,000  <br> pH  	 Unit  	 	 6.5 to 8.5  	 6.5 to 7.5  	 7 to 8  <br> NO,tN02  	 mg NIL  	 6  	 10  	 10  	 7.5  <br><br>This request is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.

The MSP (Lockheed Martin Part Number 7399001-01) is a palletized system which provides mission data processing, video processing and display, sensor management and control, and communications capabilities for the HC-144A MPA. The MSP utilizes both classified and unclassified Local Area Networks and is constructed of rugged non-developmental computer equipment, flat panel displays, communications, avionics, and sensor equipment. It consists of two workstations separated by a center console and an equipment enclosure. The equipment is mounted on a 62-inch by 108-inch cargo pallet for roll-on/roll-off capabilities and interfaces mechanically to the aircraft's cargo handling system.
<p><br />The core command and control software (C2Micro), which provides critical track correlation and integration functions for the MSP, is proprietary to Lockheed Martin, and the company has confirmed that the software is not for sale/license. Approximately eighteen obsolete components must be addressed during this production run, and five of the obsolete MSP components will require integration with the proprietary core software. Given a FY12 contract award, the Coast Guard expects that Lockheed Martin will meet the FY14 delivery requirement for 5 MSP, and that it would take another company approximately one to two additional years to produce an MSP with alternative core software.</p>
<p>Alternative MSP are not being considered at this time because of the cost and logistics impacts that would be incurred by introducing a significant change to the technical baseline of the HC-144A MPA system. The procurement of the current MSP will enable the Coast Guard to field an additional eight HC-144A MPAs with the same technical baseline as the twelve HC-144A MPA currently in service. The Coast Guard anticipates that it will compete the requirement for future MSPs (installed on HC-144A MPA #21-#36) and recapitalize the existing MSPs in FY17/18. The Coast Guard anticipates technology improvements and changes to mission profile may render the current design obsolete by that time.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is issued solely to determine whether there are any sources that could meet the Coast Guard's technical and schedule requirements for additional HC-144A MSPs. Without the MSP, the operational capability of the HC-144A MPA is significantly reduced. The Coast Guard believes that utilizing another Contractor to produce the MSP would cause unacceptable delays in meeting the requirement and would result in HC-144A MPA's being fielded without the MSP that are critical for effective and efficient operations during the delay.</p>
<p>Companies that have the capability to deliver five MSPs (Lockheed Martin Part Number 7399001-01) in FY14 must submit a capability statement detailing how it would meet the schedule, including: verify that it has the ability to obtain the existing core software or can develop an alternative core software; explain the firm's design, integration, verification, testing and certification functions and timeline to meet the schedule; and discuss why an otherwise acceptable solution from the company would be price competitive with the OEM. The capability statement shall also include the company's Dun and Bradstreet number, a discussion of any previous experience similar to this requirement, and a point of contact in the event the Coast Guard requires additional information.<br />This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Proposals submitted based on this notice will not be accepted. Capability statements received prior to the closing date and time will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is possible.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY

NO CURRENT SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS

Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is conducting market research, and identifying potential sources and best practice information towards designing, developing, and procuring a Pelvic Protective Undergarment.  The undergarment will provide protection from lower velocity small fragments and debris to the femoral, genital, perineal, and anal regions. The protection provided will help lower the probability of infection to the pelvic region by limiting the amount of debridement experienced in an explosive event. 

The undergarment must be capable of providing ballistic protection against small fragments (2 grain) at velocities in excess of 650 ft/sec as well as sand and debris at similar velocities in order to prevent such debris from embedding in the skin.
  The ballistic material burst strength desired is no less than 160 lbs/in2 and the weight desired to be no greater than 5 ounces per square yard.  This garment will be worn directly against the skin beneath the Marine Corps combat uniform.  The material that is in direct contact with the skin in the protected regions should be made from filament yarns or threads to reduce friction and increase physical comfort.  Overall physical comfort of the system is considered to be of equivalent importance to ballistic performance.   

The garment should exhibit a minimum air permeability greater than 50 cfm initially and 40 cfm after laundering at the thickest portion.  The garment should exhibit a Moisture Vapor Transmission of 500 g/m2/day.
   All layers of the garment shall dry from complete saturation in less than 4 hours.  Fabric in contact with the skin is desired to exhibit antimicrobial properties of 95% bacteria reduction after 25 home laundering cycles or at a minimum not support the growth of bacteria.  The non ballistic portion of the garment is desired to be made of materials designed to maximize breathability such as mesh, and shall exhibit minimum flexibility capability of 30% stretch and 90% recovery for both directions.  

Additionally, the garment must be able to withstand a 4 second burn at 2 cal/cm2/sec with no melting or dripping, while worn under currently fielded flame resistant clothing as measured by the Pyroman test, ASTM F1930.
   Performance data for the garment when exposed to flame using ASTM F1358 for folded method and ASTM D6413 for vertical method is desired.  

Submitted information should include ballistic and non ballistic performance data obtained from independent laboratories.  Submissions must include a statement confirming Berry Amendment compliance or documented market research validating a domestic nonavailability claim.  During the course of MARCORSYSCOMs Market research effort, some vendors may be requested to provide a limited quantity (i.e. up to 10) of undergarments under a bailment agreement.

Interested parties shall submit written materials electronically by 25 January 2012 to jennifer.glenn@usmc.mil.
  Due to email restrictions, all electronic submissions must be smaller than 5mb.  All properly marked proprietary information will be appropriately handled.  Submitted material will not be returned.

In addition to the electronic submission, interested parties may schedule a meeting with MARCORSYSCOM to discuss their submission in response to this RFI.  Meetings will be scheduled for 27 January 2012 at 1000 Corporate Center Drive, Suite 301, Stafford, VA 22554.  Meetings are limited to 30 minute sessions and are available on a first come, first served basis.   Meeting requests ONLY should be sent to etucker@patricioenterprises.com.  

MARCORSYSCOM will have representatives attending the 2012 Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show and will be available on January 17, 2012 from 8:00 am  4:00 pm and January 19, 2012 from 8:00 am  12:00 pm.
  A separate FEDBIZOPS notice was posted with instructions on how interested parties can request that MARCORSYSCOM representatives visit their booth for up to thirty (30) minutes to review any available samples of armor carriage solutions that address this RFIs requirements. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO ENTITLEMENT TO PAYMENT OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT COSTS OR CHARGES BY THE GOVERNMENT WILL ARISE AS A RESULT OF SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI AND GOVERNMENT USE OF SUCH INFORMATION. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<DESC>Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) is marketing its capabilities as a potential subcontractor for both federal and commercial work (otherwise done outside the United States). FPI is interested in entering into agreements with federal agencies and/or commercial businesses for contact center services, using federal facilities and federal inmate labor. FPI will consider all reasonable proposals that support FPI's mission. The exact agreement that constitutes each arrangement will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.
<p>DESCRIPTION OF FPI: FPI, which operates under the trade name UNICOR, is a wholly-owned government corporation within the Department of Justice, under the Federal Prison System. The corporation was created by Congress in 1934, and provides employment, education, and training opportunities to inmates under federal custody. FPI operates more than 80 factories at approximately 70 locations. FPI's product lines and service operations are extensive, producing products and services in over 80 different Federal Supply Classes for sale to Federal agencies and the Department of Defense. FPI's mission is to employ and provide skills training to the greatest practicable number of inmates in federal correctional facilities necessary to ensure the safe and secure operation of such institutions and, in doing so, to produce market priced, quality goods and services, in a self-sustaining manner that minimizes potential impact on private business and labor.</p>
<p>CONTACT CENTER OPERATION AND CAPABILITIES: FPI contact center operations perform inbound and outbound B2B services. FPI's outbound B2B centers have performed data scrubbing, lead generation and profiling for some of the top companies in America. The benefits to using FPI contact centers are that FPI has skilled agents, low labor rates, native English and Spanish, high security, and nation-wide coverage. Another benefit is that FPI can provide additional capacity for commercial businesses seeking to grow their business or needing the additional capacity to take on increased customer demand.<br /><br />BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM: FPI currently has business agreements with private sector firms to provide services to the Federal Government, as well as services to the private sector in cases where the services would otherwise be performed outside of the U.S. For some business agreements, FPI provides fully equipped and staffed factories and provides services as turn-key operations for its private sector customers. For other agreements, FPI provides inmate labor and the physical factory space for contact center operations.</p>

<p>Reference Number: <br />NB184000-12-000958</p>
<p>Notice Type: <br />Special Notice- Notice of Intent</p>
<p>Synopsis: <br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Office of Information Systems Management (OISM), intends to negotiate with COMSOL, Inc., on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to purchase COMSOL, Inc.'s COMSOL Multiphysics licenses.</p>
<p>NIST's OISM has a requirement for software that allows coupling together of different material domains, for example, RF/microwave, thermal, mechanical, and fluidic. This coupling actions of responses from the different domains need to be considered to accurately predict/understand the material properties of interest, whether these are mechanical, thermal, or electrical. It also allows for simulation of fluid flow in microfluidic circuits, and the coupling of fluid flow in microfluidic circuits to the above-mentioned domains. There is a demand for this type of software at both NIST Gaithersburg and Boulder locations.</p>
<p>COMSOL provides the simulation software for solving partial differential equations using a finite-element approach. It is implemented as a base package with a number of application-specific optional modules that can be added on. This allows that simulations from different traditional "domains" can be coupled together, for example, RF/microwave, thermal, mechanical, fluidic.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 511210 with a Size Standard of $25.0 million. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to COMSOL, Inc. for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Willie Lu at willie.lu@nist.gov. All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted so that they are received at willie.lu@nist.gov no later than January 13, 2012 at 2:00 pm Eastern Time.</p>

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Services located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Biowaves Inc. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed contractor will perform the following tasks: 1. Collect marine mammal sightings and detections, predation event samples, other remains, or related samples during vessel surveys; 2.) Make repairs to NWFSC's two towed acoustic arrays and collect marine mammal detection data using visual methods or from monitoring acoustic devices, collect predation event samples, other prey remains, or related samples during a 21 day vessel survey; 3.) Record sampling effort detections, and behavioral data of marine mammals in accordance with NWFSC protocols. Survey dates are to be determined in consultation with the NWFSC. Tentative survey dates are: 16 February - 7 March 2012. Proposed vendor shall record all effort and detection data and shall provide all data and a report summarizing the sampling effort and acoustic detections. A preliminary report describing results and conclusions shall be provided no later than May 30, 2012 and final report will be due July 30, 2012. NOAA's acoustic tracking system requires a very high degree of skill to operate and this type of work is highly specialized.

<DESC>In accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The Government intends to issue a non-competitive modification to Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. under Contract N00189-08-D-0022. When ordered by issuance of individual Task Orders (TOs), the Contractor shall provide readiness and metrics support to the Fleet Readiness Enterprise (FRE); including the Naval Aviation (NAE) and Surface Warfare (SWE) enterprises.  The enterprises are composed around specific warfighting domains and their primary providers, working across existing stovepipes, or functional commands, to ensure ability to meet the warfighting mission at the lowest possible cost.
  

The primary goal of the enterprise construct is to optimize existing resources and management of all elements of cost in order to achieve required levels of current readiness, save operating funds to re-capitalize the future Navy, and optimize the ability of the enterprise to deliver future capability on schedule and at or below cost.  To maximize Enterprise performance, the five key attributes of an Enterprise must exist:  (1) defined outputs; (2) process perspective; (3) transparency of all elements to see and react to each other in a timely manner; (4) metrics linked and driving the right behavior to achieve Enterprise results; and (5) discipline to have rigorous accountability for actions.

Top level processes in enterprise management include, for example, current readiness, supply chain management; future capability, acquisition and procurement; both current and future total force requirements; and enterprise financial management and metrics.

<ARCHDATE>02172012
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:john.p.martin5@usmc.mil">john.p.martin5@usmc.mil</a>
<DESC>The Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps, located at the Pentagon in Washington DC, has a requirement for extended preventative maintenance and warranty services on various graphics and engraving equipment located at the HQMC Reprographics Section in the Pentagon.  The period of performance is one year.  This announcement is a notice of intent to sole source the requirement under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR 6.302-1 Other Than Full and Open Competition  one responsible source.  The applicable NAICS Code is 811310.  Accordingly, the USMC Regional Contracting Office  National Capital Region (RCO-NCR) at Quantico Marine Corps Base, VA, as supporting Contracting Office for HQMC, intends to award a sole source purchase order to TyrrellTech, Inc.
 of 9045-A Maier Rd., Laurel, MD  20723 to provide the extended preventative maintenance and warranty services on the following graphics and engraving equipment.  This is an all or none requirement:

Roland XC-540, 103, Serial Number ZX55817.  Extended Service Plan.
Roland XC-540, 101, Serial Number ZX55810. Extended Service Plan.
Roland, Versa Camm/ VP-300i, Serial Number ZZ10608.  
GBC 3064WF Laminator, Serial Number TJ00379G.  Service, Maintenance Extended Warranty, Basic 4 point service.  The service does not cover replacement of rollers for cuts, etc.  
Electro Power Trim 165, Paper Trimmer, Serial Number 7831417Z10.
Pump, Vacuum for Vision 1612 Engraver, Serial Number 5140909043001.
  EGX-350 ENGRAVER, Serial Number ZY22533
Vision 1612 Engraver, Serial Number 400217783M.  One Year on-site maintenance agreement covering manufacturing defects only.   
Universal, VLS6.60 VersaLASER System, Laser Engraver, Serial Number XXX0032311105.  Service, Maintenance. 

TyrrellTech is a local company in the National Capital Region that provided the previous years maintenance support on all of HQMCs reprographics equipment.  Its close proximity to the Pentagon enables it to perform on-site maintenance services whenever necessary in a 24 hour turn-around timeframe.  The on-site services are performed either the same day or next day depending on the time of call.  For example, if a request for service is placed before 12:00 noon, the Contractor is expected to provide service by 4:00 P.M.
 the same day.  If the request is placed after 12:00 noon, the Contractor is expected to provide service no later than the next day.  TyrrellTech provides unlimited on-site support, coverage for labor and parts, and phone services between the hours of 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday (all included in the maintenance agreement).  Based on the prior year procurement and market research, TyrrellTech is the only company that can provide the unlimited maintenance services for all the above listed equipment and meet the required response time for continuity of military operations.  This is particularly the case for the GBC 3064WF Laminator, a mission critical machine in support of the Sections mission to provide rapid and reliable support to the Commandant of the Marine Corps.
  The company must be within a 50 mile radius of the Pentagon and be able to respond to requests for service within the windows stated above.  The majority of the above-listed equipment was originally purchased from TyrrellTech.  The machines are from two to five years old and in good condition.  TyrrellTech installed the machines and trained Government-user personnel on the proper way to use the machines.  The company must be thoroughly knowledgeable in the operation and maintenance of all of the equipment.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however firms that believe they can meet the requirement may provide a capability statement describing how they meet the requirement to the Contracting Officer.
  Capability statements, if received timely, will be considered; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The company must be a small business.  Responses shall be emailed to Mr. John Martin, Contracting Officer, at john.p.martin5@usmc.mil so that they are received no later than 17 January 2012, 5:00 pm Eastern Time.  Late responses will not be considered.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>8) Basis for Award: The IDIQ firm fixed priced contract award will be made to the offeror conforming to the RFP that represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price criteria considered.

The basis for award will be best value, which will be based on consideration of the following evaluation criteria: (1) Technical Capability (2) Relevant Past Performance, and (3) Price. Technical is more important than relevant past performance and when combined are more important than price. Further, as the technical evaluation of the offerors become closer in ratings, price becomes more important in determining the best value. In the event that two (2) or more offers are determined not to have any substantial non-price criteria differences award may be made to the lower priced offeror. It shall be noted that award may be made to other than the lower priced offeror if the Government determines paying a higher price is the best value. In either case, a tradeoff will be conducted. The Government reserves such right of flexibility in conducting the evaluation as necessary to assure an award with the contractor providing the best value to the Government. The Government will evaluate proposals and may award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>

<p>10) The Provision at 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: technical capability; relevant past performance; price.</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability - The Government will evaluate the offeror's capability to perform the tasks described in IDIQ Performance Work Statement (PWS). Note that simply restating the PWS requirements is insufficient. The vendor's response to the PWS requirements should demonstrate a sound, thorough and viable technical approach that specifically addresses all aspects of the PWS clearly and convincingly demonstrating subject matter expertise, understanding of the requirement, and knowledge of the USCG environment. Vendors shall provide the planned technical approach that will be utilized to accomplish all the tasks in the attached PWS (See Enclosure 1). The Government will evaluate resumes of key personnel and the proposed labor mix for how they support the offeror's technical capability.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Relevant Past Performance - To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three years and the total dollar value must exceed $100,000.00. The offeror is solely responsible for ensuring the Questionnaire is completed and returned by the respective references to the email address (Keith.Harding@uscg.mil) on or before the proposal deadline (2:00 pm EST on 01/24/2012). Past performance will be evaluated on quality of service, timeliness of performance and business relations. The Government reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information received via proposals or questionnaires. A vendor's lack of relevant past performance information will be evaluated by the Government as "Neutral" for this factor.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price - The Government will evaluate each of the four (4) separate periods of performance (base and 3 options) in the offeror's price proposal for the IDIQ contract. Labor rates will be evaluated individually to determine if they are fair and reasonable. However, price alone will not be the determining factor.</p>
<p>The factors listed above are in descending order of importance. Technical and past performance when combined, are more important than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>11) Offeror shall provide a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their offer; OR verify that information required by this provision is listed on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website located at https://orca.bpn.gov.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS UNITED STATES COAST GUARD OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131)<br />U S COAST GUARD<br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS<br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<DESC>Aeration Services<br /><br /><br />The Officer Candidate School (OCS) Physical Training (PT) fields are particularly prone to heavy foot traffic due to the candidate physical training (PT) which at times consists of roughly 2,500 candidates using the PT fields. This soil compaction reduces the ability for water to properly drain from the field and can directly result in standing water and puddles. If uncorrected, this soil compaction can lead to the thinning of the field turf. Aerating the OCS PT fields will assist in relieving the soil compaction, thus improving water drainage and improving the overall quality of the turf. On the safety side, standing water on the fields creates an unsafe condition for the candidates to PT. The standing water and resulting soft turf creates a situation where ankle injuries and lower extremity injuries are possible. In addition, the standing water provides breeding grounds for insects such as mosquitoes that can carry diseases. The aeration service OCS is currently requesting will ensure that the PT fields remain in a safe condition as well as remaining esthetically appealing. This will be a reoccurring annual service. Twice a year, once in April, and once in September.<br /><br />See attachment for more details.

The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).<br />(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date.

The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.<br />(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "Disputes."<br />(f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.<br />(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "Default."

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br><br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to note the following questions submitted and their respective answers; and to extend the due date and time for offers:
1.  The sawdust to be purchased under this request shall consist of Oak, Poplar, or Pine wood for bedding material in the horse stall, Does the material have to remain the same for all orders.  Example:  If one delivery is oak, are we required to continue with oak or dcan the next delivery be pine?  Can we interchange the bedding or do we need to stay with the same bedding type throughout the year?
Answer:  The material does need to remain constant.
2.  Can the bags pounds vary from 35 to 45 pounds?
Answer:  The weight can vary
3.  The subcontractor supplied the chips to the zoo and thought I should inform you that they preferred the higher quality product which is priced higher.  The product that conforms more closely to the solicitation specs is a much higher quality for the horses.  As a result of the higher price it is an issue if you are looking for the lowest price bid.
Answer:  Regarding the bedding, we need the better quality.  The bedding cannot be very dusty.
4.  Do we need to stay with the same manufacturer throughout the year?
Answer:  We have no preference regarding the manufacturer as long as the quality is good.
5.  If we cannot deliver all 248 bags in the first run, can we make several runs that day to deliver.
Answer:  The sawdust/bedding can be delivered in several loads.
6.  I just need to know about the specifics of the delivery of the sawdust, i.e.  ground floor delivery in a close distant from the truck, no stairs up or down, no lofts, no walking bags long distance from the tailgate of truck.  Will it be a simple download right off the truck onto a pallet or what are the details?
Answer:  Delivery is street level, approximately 25' from the tail of the truck.
7.  If we were to quote "FOB Delivered - free off truck," would this be okay.  This freight term means we would supply all equipment necessary to get the bedding to your point of receipot, i.e. dock, yard, etc, but your crews would be responsible for all unloading and handling thereafter.  Is this acceptable?
Answer:  The vendor must deliver and stack.  Usually the vendor would supply the equipment necessary however, if available the park may assist by providing a driver and equipment to off-load.
8.  Does delivery to this location require any off-road travel?  Or, is facility paved road/highway accessible?
Answer:  There is no off-road travel required.
9.  The nomenclature used in the solicitation seems to suggest this is for sawdust bedding and not in any measure sawdust itself.  Is this correct?
Answer:  The solicitation is NOT for sawdust.  It is for Bedding.

 The due date and time for offers is extended to 12:00pm ET on Tuesday, January 10, 2012  Offers must be submitted via email to:  NPNHContracting_BidProposal@nps.gov, to the attention of Linda Richardson, with a courtesy copy sent to Linda_Richardson@nps.gov.

<p>2. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131)<br />U S COAST GUARD<br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS<br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112<br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>(xiii) See additional document(s) for uploaded documents to support order requirements: N/A<br />(xiv) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS): N/A</p>
<p>(xv) QUOTES ARE DUE BY 1:30 PM EST Friday January 13th, 2012; Deadline for questions will be Wednesday January 11th, 2012 @ 1:30 PM EST. Please email your quotes and questions to Iris.M.Johnson@uscg.mil.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NICHD2012128 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $12.0m. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intend to procure on a sole source basis with Complete Genomics, 2071 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043 to provide WHOLE GENOME DNA SEQUENCING at 120 fold genome coverage, with analysis for HUMAN NORMAL/TUMOR pairs (Quantity: 3 sets) and SNP/INDEL and CNV discovery.The lab at NICHD has initiated an important project to understand the genomic effects of alcohol exposure in patients who cannot properly metabolize ethanol and consequently develop esophageal tumors. The project requires a whole genome sequencing approach to identify, with high levels of confidence, different categories of nucleotide damage in tumor and adjacent normal tissue. An essential part of the project will be to compare the nucleotide damage spectrum of our samples with similarly derived datasets from other cancers. Complete Genomics Inc., has developed an analysis pipeline that is specifically designed to identify nucleotide changes between normal-tumors pairs, which are perfectly studied for our project as outlined above. To the best of our knowledge no other company offers this service.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>The Government awarded a sole source, cost-plus-fixed-fee type modification on contract W31P4Q-09-C-0607 to DRS RSTA, Inc., 13544 N. Central Expressway, Dallas, TX 75243. This requirement was for the development of hand-held and weapon mounted system platforms for DRS's medium wave infrared (MWIR) detectors with a total estimated cost of $2,242,944 for four options.

<DESC>This notice is provided for information purposes only. NASA LaRC awarded a firmfixed price contract to Amprius Inc. for the effort entitled High Capacity SiliconNano-Wire Anode Development.  This award results from a competitive selection under theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters Office of ChiefTechnologist (OCT) Game Changing Technology (GCT) Division Broad Agency Announcement(BAA) NNH11ZUA001K, entitled "Unique and Innovative Space Technology".	The GCT Division of OCT focuses on maturing advanced space technologies that may lead toentirely new approaches for the agencies future space missions and solutions tosignificant national needs.  Successful products of GCT will provide or lead torevolutionary advances in capability. These advances will enable missions that cannototherwise be accomplished or that significantly enhance mission performance from currentcapabilities. NASAs open call for Space Technology Grand Challenges identifies the mass and lifetimelimitations of power sources as mission-limiting technology and one of four criticalareas for managing in-space resources.	The focus of this one year effort is to developthe chemistry that will allow for the manufacture of ultra-high capacity battery cellsthat will function within the extremes that characterize a NASA manned space mission.

<DESC>The St. Johns County Shore Protection Project consists of placing sand on 2.3 miles of St. Augustine Beach from the southern limits of Anastasia State Park starting at a point about 3.1 miles south from the inlet (between State monuments R-139 and R-151). The chosen Alternate B consists of placing approximately 2.1 million cubic yards of sand on the 2.3 miles of beach. The width of the berm varies between 95 feet to 485 feet from the construction baseline at Elevation +9.0 NAVD 1988. The sand will come from three borrow sources at St. Augustine Inlet. The navigation channel and the Vilano Point area at the inlet will be dredged first. Vilano Point is approximately 6.2 miles from the south end of the project beach. When these areas have been completely dredged, the southern half of the ebb shoal at the entrance to St. Augustine Inlet will be systematically dredged to place the remaining beach fill. Dredge pipeline shore landings shall only occur south of R-139. Beach tilling of the finished berm shall be required. Turbidity monitoring is also required.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>HDTRA1-12-C-0028
<AWDDATE>010612
<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition
<p>1. Nature and/or Description of Action</p>
<p>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) contracting activity proposes to procure without using full and open competition an effort entitled, "Rocket Motor Production Course RMPC."</p>
<p>2. Description of the Supplies/Services Required</p>
<p>This is a sole-source follow-on requirement currently provided by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) Launch Systems, Inc. DTRA has a requirement for trained arms control inspectors and escorts to accomplish its missions in support of treaties and agreements, specifically under the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (NST). Rocket Motor Production Course (RMPC) training provides DTRA personnel with knowledge and skills to implement the treaty between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union countries for further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms covered under the NST. NST inspectors and escorts conduct inspection activities involving solid-fueled missiles. The RMPC is a unique solid rocket motor and basic missile operations training program that supports and familiarizes the NST inspectors and escorts in the areas of orientation and production of solid fuel rocket motor fundamentals for strategic systems; operational readiness and propulsion capabilities; and observing and touring of the solid fuel rocket production and assembly facility for strategic systems, which is a crucial part of the training requirement. This action will result in a sole-source Firm-Fixed Price contract with an estimated value of $400,000. The base period of performance will be twelve months with four twelve-month option periods.</p>
<p>3. Statutory Authority</p>
<p>The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is 10 United States Code (U.SC.) 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.</p>
<p>4. Applicability of Authority</p>
<p>ATK has performed the required task over the past ten years. To further accomplish the necessary tasks under NST, the Government determined that ATK is the only company that is familiar with the treaty regulations and requirements under NST, and also possesses the solid fuel rocket production and assembly facility for strategic systems, which is a crucial part of the training requirement. Observing and touring of solid fuel rocket production facility for strategic systems is vital in providing full understanding of concepts presented in the classroom by enabling RMPC students to witness the actual production and assembly of the high level solid fuel rocket booster for strategic systems. The students will be observing and touring ATK's Missile Products Division at the Magna, UT site. ATK has in-house qualified engineering personnel who have experience in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and NST inspections and will share the realities of "real world inspection" information with the students. The trained students will eventually serve in roles as RMPC inspectors, escorts, and interpreters during future NST inspection missions. Additionally, after the end of the cold war, the need for solid fuel rocket production for strategic systems has decreased and several of the existing rocket motor production companies have merged. For example, both Pratt &amp; Whitney Space Propulsion and Northrop Grumman had been partnered with ATK Launch Systems in the solid fuel rocket booster business for strategic systems. However, both Pratt &amp; Whitney Space Propulsion and Northrop Grumman departed from the solid fuel rocket motor business for strategic systems in 2004 after transitioning all work content to ATK. Since that time, ATK has been the only company still producing solid fuel rocket boosters for strategic systems covered under the previous START Treaty and currently under NST. No other contractor possesses the requisite experience, knowledge, and production and assembly facility to adequately fulfill the requirements for the proposed contract. An additional source, assuming it has the experienced personnel to provide training, will not be able to provide the observing and touring of the high level solid fuel rocket booster production and assembly process for strategic systems, which will result in a significant risk to the treaty requirements.</p>
<p>5. Effort to Solicit Potential Sources</p>
<p>A notice of intent to award a sole-source contract on FedBizOpps was posted on July 14, 2011 soliciting responses from potential offerors. In addition, the Program Manager (PM) has researched various internal sources such as DTRA small business vendor mall and external commercial and Government sources such as www.yellow.com, and GSA Schedule to identify potential sources.</p>
<p>6. Fair and Reasonable Costs</p>
<p>The anticipated price of this contract action to the Government will be determined to be fair and reasonable based on historical data from previous contracts and input from the PM's price information for training via the Salary.Com, GSA Schedule, and Monthly Labor Review.</p>
<p>7. Market Research</p>
<p>A market survey performed on FedBizOpps in July 2011 did not reveal any company that would be able to meet the requirement. The PM's internal and external researches on suitable sources also did not identify potential companies.</p>
<p>8. Other Facts<br /><br />It is difficult to estimate the cost of establishing a solid fuel rocket motor production facility for strategic systems that is in a full operation. Because ATK is the only one that can provide the required efforts, the PM requested ATK provide assistance in estimating the value of the current production facility at Magna, UT utilized by the Missile Products Division. The ATK point of contact advised the PM to consult public financial information available in the ATK 2011 Annual Report to Stock Holders. Research of portions of that document provided an overall estimated value of the fully running facility at Magna, UT as being approximately $2.4 billion. However, two divisions jointly share the Magna, UT production and assembly areas of that facility. Unfortunately, there is no breakdown in the share holders report to indicate how much of the $2.4 billion is attributed to the Aerospace Systems Division and how much is dedicated to the Missile Products Division of those facility assets.</p>
<p>9. Interested Sources</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p>10. Subsequent Actions</p>
<p>Based on past experience, the Government anticipates a continued need for training as long as NST inspections are required.</p>

<DESC>LIMITED-SOURCES JUSTIFICATION

 
1.  Identify the agency and contracting activity.

This justification is executed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Acquisition Service-Frederick on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Compensation Service-VA/DoD Program Office.

2.  Nature/description of the action being approved.

The Government intends to negotiate a sole-source task order with Calibre Systems, Inc., in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), to continue Emergent Policy, Planning and Execution (EPPE) services currently provided under VA798-11-D-0123 VA798-11-0001. 

This work continues current services but cannot be considered a logical follow-on in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) because the original services were not competed.

3.  Description of supplies/services required to meet the agency's needs.

In August 2011, the President called on the Department of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) to lead a Task Force with the White House economic and domestic policy teams to maximize the career readiness of employment of all Service Members. The Compensation Service-VA/DoD Program Office leads the development of proposals to assist with the transition from the military to a productive civilian life and implements education and employment programs for transitioning Service Members. Subject matter experts with extensive experience with development of education and employment for transitioning Service Members will be utilized to support the fielding of the pilot program for the Initial Operating Capability (IOC) by April 2012.  

The Compensation Service-VA/DoD Program Office requires the review and analysis required for development, design, and implementation of a program that supports the life-cycle and transition assistance of service members from the DoD to the VA. This will include defining the program and mission, identifying goals, objectives and tasks, and developing a long-range plan that will include an implementation plan, execution plan, resources, and a road-map to the future.

In this role, the Compensation Service-VA/DoD Program Office will be tasked by the Office of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary on short notice to provide professional expertise in all of the issue areas cited above. The Program Office therefore requires a cadre of contractor professionals with third-party objectivity and credibility ready to respond to short notice tasks, such as supporting the development of position papers, provide analysis on special topics, provide administrative and documentation support, draft plans, memoranda, briefings, articles and other documents to support communications needed information other tasks which address the Program Office support role at the executive level for emergent policy studies, in direct support of the Office of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary as may be required.

The interim task order will have an estimated performance period of 1/3/2011- 3/2/2012 with two 1-month option periods, to be exercised in the event that award of the competed effort is delayed. The estimated value of this requirement is $296, 000.00.  FY12 funds are available.

4.  Authority and supporting rationale.

In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.  

The Presidential Task Force is very complex and has strict timelines and deliveries. Calibre's work for the Compensation Service-VA/DoD Program Office currently supports both DoD and VA in their roles on the task force.  It is estimated that in the first week of January, the White House will direct the task force to roll out a prototype of the VA transition program to service members in the April timeframe.  Calibre possesses current knowledge of the critical mission requirements to continue the development and implementation of the model.  Calibre's current work includes developing the plan, metrics and certification processes.  Orienting another contractor on the project would result in significant delays and result in the task force's inability to meet the strict guidelines and deliveries required by the mandate.

5.  A determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value to the Government.

Competing these interim services would result in substantial costs to the Government not expected to be recovered through competition, in consideration of the current contractor's expertise.  Proposal evaluation and contractor orientation delays would result in an unacceptable setback in the task force efforts. The Contracting Officer will evaluate pricing and determine the price to be fair and reasonable before awarding a new task order.

6.  Description of market research conducted and results/Statement of the reason market research was not conducted.

No market survey was conducted since these services are follow-on requirements to existing services. Market surveys were conducted at the time of the original award.

7.  Any other supporting facts.

None.

8.  Actions taken to remove barriers that led to restricted consideration.

The original EPPE services to include the services provided to the task force will be competed under the Services for Program Excellence and Corporate Transformation Umbrella (SPECTRUM) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts to ensure that the Government will receive best value for these services.
