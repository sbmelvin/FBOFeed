Subject: Presolicitation Notice for Upcoming Issuance of Request for Proposal
(RFP) No. SL688-05;
Sri Lanka Tsunami Reconstruction Project
Pursuant to the authority contained in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the US Agency for International Development in New Delhi, India (USAID/India) is issuing this presolicitation
notice for the upcoming RFP to be issued in accordance with U.S. Government Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.300 for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of a bridge, road and fisheries harbors, vocational technical schools on the island of Sri Lanka. Offerors must be qualified U.S. or non-U.S. construction engineering firms (subcontracting with particular
emphasis on the use of Sri Lankan firms and personnel). To be eligible as a construction firm, a firm must perform construction as a significant portion of its business; must be incorporated and
have its corporate headquarters in a country other than Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Laos or Syria; must have paid corporate franchise and employment taxes in the country where its headquarter office is located for a minimum of two years and shall have filed corporate and income tax declarations for a minimum of two corporate years, having paid any applicable taxes
determined to be due as a result of such filings; and employ citizens in key management positions from countries other than Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iran, Laos or Syria. Performance
and payment bonds will be required.

Estimated cost of construction is between $25,000,000 and $35,000,000.

USAID/Sri Lanka intends to award one contract to achieve the objectives identified in the RFP.

The contract will be in effect for an estimated three year period.
PROJECT SCOPE: This is a two-phase design-build selection process under FAR Part 36.300. Design-build means combining design and construction in a single contract with one prime contractor. The project scope includes: replacement of the Arugam Bay Bridge, provision of water supply for Pottuvil and Arugam Bay tourist area, wastewater collection, treatment and disposal in the Arugam Bay tourist area, improvement of the 17 kilometer road connecting
Arugam Bay to Panama, repair and expansion of fishing harbors in several (up to 4) selected locations on the south coast, repair of several existing vocational education schools, expansion of
two schools into regional vocational educational centers, and construction of a small bridge and associated roads in Matur near Tricomalee. Shelter will not be included in this program as it is
being covered by other donors.

The contractor may also need to retain suitable subcontractors to carry out studies. These may include an area development study for Arugam Bay with a focus on tourism development.  Concerning the construction of the regional schools the contractor will need to ensure that the design of new construction ncorporates “green” design principles for lighting, ventilation and electric power consumption.

PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS: The RFP for phase–one will be issued at this website on or about May 2, 2005. An amendment to the phase-one RFP will be provided directly to up to five (5) offerors from phase-one selected to submit phase-two proposals. Phase-two of the
solicitation will be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and shall require the submission of technical and cost proposals.

USAID is not liable for any costs incurred in the preparation and submission of offers.

Issuance of this presolicitation notice and the forthcoming RFP does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the U.S. Government (USG). The USG reserves the right to reject any
and all offers received. Final award of any resultant contract cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated and committed through internal USAID procedures. USAID
shall not be liable for any costs incurred by offerors in the preparation and submission of an offer.

This program is authorized in accordance with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSCPOL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.
(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.
(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.
(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:
NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to schedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.
(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research of the Food and Drug Administration has a requirement to gain access to data resources that can be used to (1) conduct drug safety analyses to the benefit of the public’s health; (2) respond expeditiously to urgent public safety concerns; (3) provide a mechanism for collaborative pharmacoepidemiological research designed to test hypotheses, particularly those arising from suspected adverse reactions reported to FDA and enable rapid access to U.S. population-based data sources to ensure public safety when necessary. 

The Contractor shall provide US health encounter data for pharmacoepidemiology studies through collaboration with FDA; availability of a computerized system for linking each patient to all relevant medical care data including enrollment status, drug exposure data, coded medical outcomes, vital records (desired, but not required), cancer registries (desired, but not required), and birth defect registries (desired, but not required); capability of providing a patient population with low turnover, thereby permitting long-term longitudinal follow-up of most patients for acute or delayed adverse effects from drugs or other medical products; ability to capture all outpatient prescription drug exposures and health provider encounters, linked longitudinally to each patient; ability to capture all health provider encounters whether in the ambulatory, emergency, chronic care, or acute care setting in sufficient detail so that FDA has the ability to estimate the contribution of various risk factors (e.g., age, gender, dose, co-existing disease, disease severity, concomitant medications) associated with the occurrence of medical events of interest; demonstrated (post HIPAA) ability to access and retrieve complete, primary medical records as required for completion and validation of studies; ability to provide exposure data on new molecular entities (those approved within the last 5 years in the United States) and identify adverse drug events that occur infrequently (i.e., at rates lower than can be detected in clinical trials); ability to provide data and preliminary analyses to determine the feasibility of formal studies within 4 weeks of a data request; capability to form groups (i.e., cohorts) of patients exposed to one or more drug or biologic products and to follow them for the occurrence of one or more medical outcomes; full disclosure of data collection, coding, and configuration methods to allow FDA to appropriately interpret findings; and it shall be solely the Offeror’s responsibility to de-identify the data for FDA use.  FDA will require no patient-, provider-, or health plan-specific identifiers.

In providing access to longitudinal, population-based data, the Offeror shall ensure that the following criteria are met.  At a minimum, the database description shall include: number of people (active and inactive) in the database, distribution of person time by calendar year in the database, extent of geographic diversity, demographics, size of special populations of interest (including children, women of childbearing age, and elderly patients); turnover rate, and enrollment data (if applicable) for participating individuals.

In addition, the following information shall be provided to FDA: the number of years of data available overall; the lag time between the health encounter date and availability of the data; the mean, median, and range of observation time for patients in the database; and data collection and management procedures.

These longitudinal data shall have the capability to follow uniquely identifiable individuals (using encrypted patient identifiers).  Demographic information including but not limited to age and gender, health history, diagnoses and procedures, and hospitalizations shall be provided.  Information on race/ethnicity shall be included if available, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.  In addition, for each patient these data shall contain prescription drug and biologic utilization information, including the generic and brand name of the product, strength, dosage form, days supply, all dates dispensed, initial/continuing therapy indicator, quantity dispensed, instructions for use (if available), and prescriber specialty.

A one (1) year base contract with four (4), one (1) year options is intended. This RFP Number HHSF223200510010C will be available on or about April 25, 2005. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal for consideration by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

The period of performance for this effort shall be a base period of 12 months followed by four (4), one (1) year option periods. In order to allow MCSC and its customers to efficiently task the contractor with minimal procurement lead-time, an indefinite delivery type contract incorporating individual delivery/task orders will be utilized for this effort.  Award of more than one contract is contemplated.  Each contract will include a guaranteed contract minimum of $50K and a contract maximum of $35M.  Task orders will be issued and competed between the contracts awarded under this procurement.  Labor will be awarded on a Firm-Fixed Price basis, with other direct costs and travel reimbursed on a cost basis. Deliverables, period of performance, and work requirements will be defined by the Project Office and identified within each order.  Proposal Preparation: MCSC requests that all interested parties submit a combined technical / price proposal of not more than ten (10) pages submitted on 8.5 by 11 paper at 12 pitch or greater font size, that addresses the following areas: (1) past Research and Development (R&D) performance, (2) past performance with USMC related R&D efforts, (3) past performance with USMC related academic studies and analysis, (4) in-house capability as it relates to research facilities, faculty, graduate students, etc., (5) existing strategic business partnerships (6) experience as a recognized center of excellence in a particular discipline, (7) capability to perform classified work, (8) level of experience with Government contracting and (9) anticipated labor categories that will support this effort and the associated hourly rate for each.

Note that the resumes and rate information will not be counted as a part of the 10 pages.   An original and four (4) copies of the proposal are required and can be submitted via CD ROM. Tables and illustrations may use a reduced font style, not less than 8 points.  Foldouts are not allowed.  All material submitted may be single-spaced.  Offerors should ensure that each page provides identification of the submitting Offeror in the header or footer.     Please note, offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information may be obtained at the following website:  www.ccr.gov. Sealed offers for the items to be provided shall be hand-carried or express mailed via UPS or Federal Express to the following location by 2:00PM (EST) 22 April 2005: COMMANDER, Attn: Ms.Peggy Smith, CT, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street, VA, 22314-5010.  NOTE: Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address. Clauses: * Federal Acquisition Regulation-52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, (Jan 2004): Multiple Offers are discouraged. *FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).

(c)	Price – Evaluated, but not rated. Award(s) shall be made to the offeror(s) whose proposal(s) presents the best value to the government.  In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall technical and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price.  However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals.  A written notice of award(s) or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror(s) within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract(s) without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer(s) (or part(s) of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations. *FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation ! will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather infor! mation you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).   *52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items  *52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds.  *52.216-18 Ordering  (a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule.

The current requirement is a proposed one-year extension of the current CPFF contract, N00140-04-D-H027, with SAIC for the support.   The extension is necessary to allow time for the competitive solicitation of a follow-on contract for support.  An estimated 52,640 man-hours of support are required during the period of the proposed contract extension from 14 July 2005 through 13 July 2006.  The procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with SAIC since they are the only source with experience in the tactics, training and support needed for providing close air support as relates to Joint National Training Capabilities (JNTC) within the time specified.

Professional Engineering Services are required for an Indefinite Quantity Contract for Professional Engineering Services Required for Water Quality Compliance within Areas under the Cognizance of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Atlantic.  Projects can be categorized as design or engineering services projects and shall include, but not be limited to:  water quality compliance, water quality management, pollution prevention, industrial wastewater treatment/pretreatment, project documentation, plans, specifications, cost estimates and related studies.  The preponderance of work on this contract is anticipated to occur in the Mid-Atlantic Region; however, the area of responsibility under the contract will include the Continental United States (CONUS) and Puerto Rico.  Knowledge of all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations associated with water and wastewater is required.  This includes, but is not limited to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), EPA effluent guidelines, and Pretreatment Regulations.  Knowledge of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and their interaction with the Clean Water Act (CWA) is also required.

Typical taskings may include any of the following:  water quality evaluations, impact assessments, and waste load allocation determinations; mixing zone studies and dilution modeling (with some emphasis on tidally influenced receiving waters); water, wastewater and storm water characterizations; chemical and biological analyses of wastewaters, receiving water and sediments, including ability to conduct assessments utilizing "clean" chemistry techniques; industrial and domestic wastewater treatment process evaluations and feasibility studies; treatment plant operator training; industrial and potable water/domestic wastewater treatment process evaluations; source control studies; Cross Connection/Backflow Prevention and sanitary surveys; treatment evaluation studies of domestic sewage and ship's Blackwater/Greywater discharges; water quality compliance and condition assessments; development of relational databases, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) related to management of environmental programs; development of best management practices, pollution abatement and management action plans; preparation of reports and applications to be used in compliance and permit negotiations with regulators; preparation of detailed construction scoping documents with budget estimates and witness data sketches (DD Form 1391); wastewater treatment plant, and pump station evaluations and subsequent design upgrades and improvements; design solutions to correct illicit discharges to sanitary and storm sewers, design of pretreatment and pollution prevention control systems related to industrial wastewaters; pretreatment, certificate to construct/non-discharge type, and NPDES permit application preparation; associated laboratory support for wastewater, storm water and residual characterizations; Oily Waste/Waste Oil (OW/WO) handling and treatment facility design; and development of Operation and Maintenance Manuals for water and wastewater treatment systems.

Taskings may have very short time frames as they result from enforcement actions directed to Navy or Marine Corps permittees by regulators.  Additional water quality compliance work may be added to the contract without further advertisement.

The contract requires that the selected firm have on-line access to E-mail via the Internet for routine exchange of correspondence.

The A&E must demonstrate his and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all environmental engineering services and optional services.  The Evaluation Factors are weighted with (1) and (2) being the most important; factors (3) through (6) are of equal importance; and (7) and (8) are of lesser importance and will be used as tie-breakers among technically equal firms.  Specific evaluation factors include:

1.  Specialized Experience:  Firms and consultants (if proposed) will be evaluated in terms of their recent experience (last 5 years) in performing environmental services associated with client compliance with the CWA.  Specialized experience is required in water quality evaluations and waste load allocation determinations; mixing zone studies and dilution modeling (with emphasis on tidally influenced receiving waters); wastewater and storm water characterizations; chemical and biological analyses of water and wastewaters, receiving water and sediments, including demonstrated expertise with the use of "clean" chemistry techniques; industrial and domestic wastewater treatment process evaluations, source surveys, and treatment evaluation studies; application of GIS/MIS; and development of best management practices and pollution abatement plans.  Demonstrated expertise with regulatory aspects of the CWA is required including, but not limited to effluent guidelines, NPDES pretreatment program development and regulations, water quality standards, Total Maximum Daily Load development, and non-point source pollutant control/management.

2.  Professional qualifications of the technical staff in the types of work identified in Evaluation Factor 1.  The firm will be evaluated in terms of:
(a) Active professional registration of the engineering/technical staff, including professional registration in Puerto Rico.
(b) Experience of the technical staff in performing the services described in Evaluation Factor 1.
(c) Familiarity with CWA, NPDES regulations, Pretreatment regulations and related State regulations as well as RCRA, Hazardous Waste regulations and related State regulations.

3.  Capability to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of services and ability to surge to meet unexpected project demands.  Firms should assume the need to staff up to 5 simultaneous taskings.  Firms will be evaluated in terms of impact of this workload on the technical staff's projected workload during the contract period.

4.  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated in past performance with this Command, other DOD agencies, and private companies in terms of demonstrated long term business relationships and repeat business (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1).  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.  Firms will also be evaluated on their demonstrated history of meeting negotiated project schedules and producing high quality work.

5.  Quality Control Program:  Firms will be evaluated on the acceptability of their internal quality control program used to assess technical accuracy in reports, to assure overall coordination between engineering and technical disciplines, and their means of ensuring quality services from their consultant laboratories.

6.  Location in the general geographical area of the contract and knowledge of localities (provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).  Firms should demonstrate the ability to support Navy and Marine Corps installations in the CONUS and Puerto Rico Area of Responsibility with regards to CWA related work throughout the contract area.  Firms will be evaluated on their proximity and familiarity with major fleet concentration areas in Florida, Virginia, California, and Washington.

7.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

8.  Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan:  Firms will be evaluated on the extent to which they identify and commit to the published Small Business Subcontracting Program.  The Secretary of the Navy has assigned the Naval Facilities Engineering Command goals expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses of 74.85%.  Included in the SB goals are targets for:  Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) - 15.60%; Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) – 13.92%; Veterans Owned Small Business (VOSB) – 0.12%; Services Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) – 0.12%; and HUBZone Small Business – 1.17%.

Large business firms shall submit their Navy-wide SF 295, Summary Subcontract Report with their SF 330.  The slated firms will be required to provide a preliminary subcontracting plan (support for small business subcontracting) as part of the interview.

The duration of the contract will be for one (1) year from the date of an initial contract award with four (4) additional one year option periods.  The total amount that may be paid under this contract (including option years) will not exceed $3,000,000 for the entire contract term.  The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial Task Order.  The options may be exercised within the time frame specified in the resultant contract at the sole discretion of the Government subject to workload and/or satisfaction of the A&E performance under the subject contract.  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  No other general notification to firms for other similar projects performed under this contract will be made.  Type of contract:  Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity Contract.  This proposed contract is being solicited on an unrestricted basis; therefore, replies to this notice are requested from all business concerns.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for technical representative services at Ellington Field to support maintenance of Honeywell specific avionics installed in the majority of NASA-JSC's aircraft fleet.  The technical representative is required to function as a liaison between Honeywell International and NASA-JSC personnel.  The period of performance for this requirement is three years, which consists of a one year base (July 15, 2005 through July 14, 2006) and (2) one-year options (July 15, 2006 through July 14, 2007 and July 15, 2007 thruogh July 14, 2008).	 NASA/JSC intends to purchase the service from Honeywell International on a sole source basis.	This determination was reached based on the fact that Honeywell International has all of the proprietary information rights for Honeywell specific avionics.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Special Operations Acquisition and Logistics Center, Directorate of Procurement intends to award sole source, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to Nordic Ammunition Company (NAMMO), Nammo Raufoss, N-2831 Raufoss, Norway in accordance with FAR 6.302-1; (10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  A five-year ID/IQ contract type is planned with a minimum of 350 each and a maximum of 3,350 each 70-millimeter (mm) multipurpose penetrator (MPP) rounds.  The procurement action will also require testing support and potential development of a 70mm MPP training warhead.   USSOCOM desires the acquisition of 70mm MPP warheads for use on the 2.75 inch Hydra rocket.  The intent is to qualify a MPP warhead that provides an improved capability against an array of hardened targets (concrete /earth & timber bunkers) over the current arsenal.  The 70mm MPP is a derivative of the NAMMO RA79 warhead, originally designed as an anti-shipping missile for the armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  The design features that provide effectiveness against lightly-to-medium armored targets, also makes it a capable system against concrete and earth & timber bunkers.  Delivery is expected on a FOB Destination basis.   The Government does not own current data, drawings, or other specifications to permit full and open competition.     All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal in writing that may be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.     A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) – Orlando, TSD intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Advanced Systems Technologies, Inc.(AST) on a sole source basis. This FFP contract will provide for the follow-on phase of a multi-phased effort for training product development for the SubSkillsNet project. SubSkillsNet is a family of part-task trainers under development at NAVAIR Orlando that focus on tactics, navigation and piloting, collision avoidance, classification of sonar contact information and contact target motion analysis (TMA).  Each trainer is designed to run individually as a single task trainer or networked with other SubSkillsNet trainers to provide a low-cost team training capability. There are currently over two-dozen unique applications that have been delivered to the fleet. The SubSkillsNet software was developed by AST under Navy oversight. 

NAVAIR Orlando TSD has identified requirements for several related products that must be completed in the near term. These products fall into the SubSkillsNet family and add increased functionality to the networked training system. A set of personal computer (PC)-based part-task training software products shall be updated, along with materials to support the training of piloting and navigation teams.  The contractor will be required to provide qualified personnel to upgrade and integrate the individual part-task training software training products for the SubSkillsNet to form a multi-use team trainer and will continue designing, developing, documenting, and testing each of the twelve (12) SubSkillsNet components described in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The delivery schedule for these components ranges from 1 month to 13 months.   

The work will be conducted on site at the NAVAIR Orlando DeFlorez building to be coincident with the laboratory and test facility.  Some integration tasks will be conducted at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Carderock MD, the Naval Submarine Base in Groton CT, and at Lockheed Martin in Manassas VA.  All personnel working on this project must have Security Clearances at the Secret Level. 

The following list contains the specialized skills required to develop and maintain SubSkillsNet, VISIT, and PMOBT applications.

·	Sufficient knowledge of and experience with the NMEA 0183 interface to extend the SubSkillsNet/VMS real-time data communication.  Since NMEA 0183 is a serial protocol, this knowledge also extends to familiarity with virtual serial port software.
·	The capability to write software to read, process, and write Digital Nautical Chart data (DNC) and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED).
·	Knowledge of and experience with SQL, XML, HTML and PSP sufficient to create dynamic databases, generate documentation, and maintain a website.
·	Extensive knowledge of and experience with TCP/IP programming, especially as it relates to interfacing to the Common Basic Operator Trainer (CBOT), the Sonar Basic Operator Trainer (SBOT), and the Naiad library high-level networking functions used throughout the SubSkillsNet product line.
·	Ability to implement DIS protocol data units (PDUs), standard and experimental, to create real-time visualizations of ocean surface, underwater, ships, navigation aids, and landmass.
·	Experience with hardware and software interfaces to servo-digital converters and custom USB boards.
·	Experience with MicroSoft Visual Studio C++ IDE, InstallShield, Visual Source Safe, 3D Studio Max, DirectX9 (sound, interface, and 3D)
·	Familiarity and experience with creating surface ship, submarine, and aircraft spherical photographs.  This process requires professional photography skills using specialized equipment and subsequent digital editing and “stitching” of adjacent photographs to create each spherical node.  Also required is knowledge of maintaining and extending 3D rendering software that projects each resulting image file onto a flat display surface.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  After reviewing the above information, interested parties that believe they are technically capable of meeting all of these requirements, including the delivery schedules, may provide a technical capabilities statement with sufficient technical information to allow for an evaluation of the company’s ability to meet the Government’s requirements.  Please provide the technical capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer, Patricia Neal (Davenport), at Patricia.neal@navy.mil ,  FAX 407-380-4164, Phone 407-380-4064, as soon as possible, but NLT 22 April 2005.  NAVAIR Orlando, TSC, will consider all responses.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The purpose of this amended Synopsis is to correct an error in the Synopsis initially published in FedBizOpps on April 5, 2005.   Specifically, the four incumbent contracts were awarded in 2001, and those incumbent contracts therefore have the identifying digits 01 rather than 00 just before the letter C.  Accordingly, the four incumbent contracts are:  DTFH61-01-C-00180 (SAIC);  DTFH61-01-C-00181 (Cambridge Systematics); DTFH61-01-C-00182 (Battelle); DTFH61-01-C-00183 (Booz-Allen & Hamilton).

We are proposing a requirement to require all incoming and  outgoing material to be shipped to a centralized location in order to confirm  receipt + verification of correct asset, accuracy of shipping documents and to  perform a final inspection before shipment.  Since cost is also a priority for  our customers, we don’t want this to result in a large price increase.  We  would like your comments concerning the best commercial practices for this  requirement.  Is there a better way to ensure asset in-transit visibility?   Please provide your comments by 3 December 2004. NOTE: All Prospective Offerors:  Please review all updated attached files  below and provide your comments and questions by 3 December 2004.  It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.

INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and  operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently  active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some  customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives  more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material  (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is  not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for  supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However,  the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD  approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of  the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized)  sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award  fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised  to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of  contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

Please provide your comments by 3 December 2004. NOTE: All Prospective Offerors:  Please review all updated attached files  below and provide your comments and questions by 3 December 2004.  It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.

<DESC>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) anticipates issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for offers to administer the Department of Defense (DoD) National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship Program on or about 01 Feb 05.  The NDSEG program promotes education in science and engineering disciplines relevant to the defense mission through three-year graduate fellowships to U.S. citizens who have demonstrated ability and special aptitude for advanced training in science and engineering.  Preference is given to applicants who indicate an intention to pursue a doctoral degree in science, math, and engineering (SME) discipline.  NDSEG Fellows may choose U.S. institutions of higher education with an accredited program in the appropriate SME discipline.  Recipients of NDSEG Fellowships do not incur any military obligation.  The NDSEG Fellowship program provides monthly stipends to the Fellows as well as payment of full tuition and required fees to the institution of choice.  Each application will be evaluated and ranked by a disciplinary panel of academic experts from the science and engineering discipline of the applicant’s proposed advanced degree program.  Final selection of awardees is made by the three participating DoD services:  the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the Army Research Office and the Office of Naval Research.  The current stipend amount starts at $30,500, prorated monthly based on a twelve-month academic year.  The present contract (F49620-02-C-0041) was awarded in August 2002.  The contract covers the administrative cost of the program and allows for transfer of funds (pass through funding) to the contractor to pay participants’ stipends and academic fees.  The present contract’s period of performance for the pass through funding is scheduled to end July 2005.  AFOSR plans to compete and issue a follow-on contract.  AFOSR is seeking qualified sources to provide the necessary personnel, accounting, administrative and database management services, and other resources required for the administration of the NDSEG Fellowship program.

MARKET SURVEY
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Description 


The Container IPT, Agile Combat Support Systems Squadron (ACSSS), Air Armament Center, Eglin AFB FL, is requesting information from potential sources capable of updating and improving or redesigning the Government’s Container Design Retrieval System (CDRS).  CDRS is a database of long life, reusable containers established to prevent the proliferation and duplication of munitions containers within DOD.  CDRS provides tri-service users (which include the Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard, Marines, Defense Logistics Agency and contractors) with a means of submitting a request via phone, fax, email ( cdrs@eglin.af.mil ) or through the CDRS websites, https://peonet.eglin.af.mil/containers/site.htm  or https://wmnet.eglin.af.mil/containers/site.htm to the Container IPT to search its database for possible existing or proven containers or container designs.  The current CDRS was written in 1991 in Microsoft ACCESS and contains approximately 6000 containers.  The data provided by the tri-service users to the Container IPT and captured in the database include: Requestor Information: Project Lead (Full Name), Street Address, City/Base, State/Province, Zip/Postal Code, Telephone (area code and DSN), Fax (area code and DSN), E-mail, DOD/Government Activity (Office Symbol), Contractor, Contract Number, Government POC, POC Information: POC Address, POC City/Base, POC State/Province, POC Zip/Postal Code, POC Telephone (are code and DSN), POC Fax (area code and DSN), POC E-mail, Item Description: Nomenclature, NSN/Part Number, Dimensions: Length, Width, Height, Diameter, Weight (lbs), Fragility of Item (linked to Fragility Factors), Item DOD Hazard Class, Drawing Available (Yes/No radial buttons), Special Handling Requirements or Constraints, Container Requirements: Quantity, Date Required, Number Items Per Container, Container Composition, Shock Migration System, Opening Style, Other Required Features.  Features/improvements to CDRS desired include: auto back-up, incorporation of standard fail-safe software devices to prevent inadvertent loss and corruption of information, enforcement of referential integrity, automatic entry date tag to identify date CDRS request submitted, feature to prevent unused spaces and blank records from being saved to the database, check all objects for dead ends and errors, indicator on each form to show user the number of records returned from a filter, improved ease of adding new records (autonumber or macro for creating sequential and unique key field values, check default values, and improve error handling for invalid new records), simple switchboard tied to an autoexec macro, improve look of reports (headers, footers, fonts, etc), consider a form for all reports with command buttons and report descriptions, addition of “Email This Record” functions, investigate how to automatically import missing FEDLOG records, and create the following automated reports:  compact and expanded view of assets and requests, Email ready responses to container requests, Cost savings statistics, Database activity metrics, Customer feedback reports.  ACSSS has no software platform preference.  Upgrades and improvements or redesign must be cost effective (currently the ACSSS projected budget for this project is $40K), user friendly and compatible with Windows XP Operating System.  Responses to this request for information (RFI) will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  In order to initiate an exchange of information, we are requesting that interested parties submit any or both of the following: (1) an up to 5 page paper that identifies proven software or database upgrade and improvement solutions and explains potential for adaptation to CDRS, and (2) product brochures or marketing materials.  Firms responding to this RFI should state whether they are or are not a small business concern or small, disadvantaged business concern as defined by FAR 52.219-1 and 52.219-2, respectively.

<DESC>The Defense Commissary Agency, Facility Program Manager (DECA/FPM) is contemplating a Rapid Ordering Contract for Commissary Sustainment (ROCCS) providing for decentralized ordering of work to optimize individual commissary sustainment beginning in FY06.  The primary tool to implement ROCCS will be multiple award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for maintenance (except maintenance of Refrigeration and HVAC equipment), repair, renovation, alteration and minor construction of its commissaries in the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii.  This Sources Sought synopsis and Request for Information (RFI) seeks to identify 8(a) or HUBZone 8(a) concerns and to obtain industry comment on the concept based on the generalized information contained in this document.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Section Code is 23.  This RFI is neither a formal solicitation nor a request for proposals.  This RFI is for informational and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Defense Commissary Agency.  This is not an acquisition of commercial items as defined in FAR Part 12. See note 26. 


ROCCS Concept:

Program Objectives:  

The DeCA Facility Program Manager seeks to improve its commissary maintenance/sustainment delivery process and results.  Specifically, DeCA is interested in increasing the quality of the delivered products, increasing user satisfaction, decreasing time to award and delivery of completed maintenance, repair, renovation, alteration and minor construction projects.

Program Scope:

ROCCS projects will consist of maintenance, repair, renovation, alteration and minor construction ranging in value from $50.00 to $500,000.00 on individual delivery orders in each district.  DeCA’s total annual workload requirement to be divided among nine Districts is estimated to be $15,000,000.  It is the intention of this acquisition to award two (2) 8(a) IDIQ “basic” contracts in each of the ten(10) Districts using the procedures outlined in FAR Part 15 and supplements thereto.  The ten (10) Districts in the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii are identified as follows:  

(1) South Central District - Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, twenty (20) commissaries.
(2) South East District - Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and South Carolina, forty-one (41) commissaries.
(3) Mid-Atlantic District - North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Washington DC, twenty six (26) commissaries.  
(4) NorthEast District - Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania, nineteen (19) commissaries.  
(5) North Central (East) District - Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin, twelve (12) commissaries.  
(6) North Central (West) District - Colorado, North Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming and South Dakota, twelve (12) commissaries.  
(7) North West District - Idaho, Washington, and Montana, nine (9) commissaries.  
(8) Western District - Arizona, California, Utah, and Nevada, thirty-two (32) commissaries. 
(9) Hawaii District consists of five (5) commissaries.
(10) Alaska District – Alaska, five (5) commissaries

The total number of commissaries is 181.  Each district will be solicited separately.

The government envision the primary 8(a) contractor for each district to set-up several subcontractor relationships with other 8(a) or other small business concerns at the individual commissary or state to provide all requirements within that particular district.  

The government invites industry to comment regarding its thoughts, ideas, concerns, perceived benefits, possible inhibitions and weaknesses of this ROCCS concept.  Recommendations for process improvement are encouraged.  

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The contract will not be awarded to split a district into smaller groups.  Example District 1 consists of commissaries located in the states of Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.  The government will not split District 1 and award just Texas.  The period of performance will commence approximately 30 days after date of award through two years thereafter with 2 one-year options to extend for a total performance period not to exceed 48 months.  The first solicitation will be issued on or about 01 June 2005.

The ROCCS contractor shall be required to perform work in the district identified, with 24/7 availability, provide emergency response service within two (2) hours of notification.  The Commissary must remain open and operational during business hours throughout the period of performance.

DeCA would greatly appreciate your input concerning any aspect of the content of this RFI document.  Your comments are important and will be considered in the development of realistic goals and objectives.  Please comment as appropriate; prefer you address each question below in formulating your response.  The following are additional factors concerning the contract acquisition strategy that we would like you to consider and offer your comments.   

1.  The basic IDIQ contracts will also include a guaranteed minimum dollar amount.  What guaranteed minimum dollar amount would you consider to be sufficient to interest you enough to submit a proposal and why?

2.  The Government contemplates that the contract will include a two (2) year base period with two (2) option years.  Is this an appropriate program duration?  If not, why?

3.  Would there be anything that you recommend to ensure that DeCA would consistently obtain successful projects in terms of project cost, project schedule, innovation, quality and customer satisfaction?

4.  Are there any unrealistic requirements/stipulations that would prevent your firm from responding to an RFP for this type of contract? 

5.  The government intends to negotiate pre-established pricing for work call responses that would originate through a government operated response center.  It is intended that labor rates for response calls be tied to applicable Davis Bacon or Service Contract Act wage rates.  It is also intended that work above the emergency or routine response call level would be issued to the ROCCS contractors through Task Orders that would be negotiated based on labor and material charges.  Is this pricing strategy reasonable and appropriate for the type of work to be performed?

6.  Would the contractor be able to establish a pre-determined, single rate for all trades at a specific location and still comply with applicable Davis Bacon or Service Contract Act wage rate provisions, or would it be better to segregate wage rates by trades?

7.  It is envisioned as part of the contract strategy, that the contractor will be required to establish a network of relationships with local contractors to respond to routine and emergency service calls.  The government envisions that pricing for each response call that the contractor will make will include a trip charge that would cover the contractor/subcontractor overhead and travel time to get to the location.  What would you consider a fair and reasonable charge, comparable with standard industry practice, to make a response call for maintenance and repair services?

8.  The government envisions placing a $5,000 maximum on work that can be addressed through response calls and a $500,000 maximum on work that can be negotiated on individual Task Orders.  Are these limits appropriate and reasonable?

DeCA contemplates hosting an Industry Day Conference at Lackland AFB, TX the week of the 23 May 2005 to discuss the ROCCS concept and acquisition strategy.  If interested in attending please submit your list of attendees, titles and/or professions, to aid in determining a suitable meeting place.  

Please forward your email responses to the Contracting Officer, Devindranath Gokool (email gokool.devindranath@randolph.af.mil) or Linda Cavazos (email linda.cavazos@randolph.af.mil) no later than 03 May 2005.

<DESC>The Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) anticipates issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for offers to administer the Department of Defense (DoD) National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship Program on or about 01 Feb 05.  The NDSEG program promotes education in science and engineering disciplines relevant to the defense mission through three-year graduate fellowships to U.S. citizens who have demonstrated ability and special aptitude for advanced training in science and engineering.  Preference is given to applicants who indicate an intention to pursue a doctoral degree in science, math, and engineering (SME) discipline.  NDSEG Fellows may choose U.S. institutions of higher education with an accredited program in the appropriate SME discipline.  Recipients of NDSEG Fellowships do not incur any military obligation.  The NDSEG Fellowship program provides monthly stipends to the Fellows as well as payment of full tuition and required fees to the institution of choice.  Each application will be evaluated and ranked by a disciplinary panel of academic experts from the science and engineering discipline of the applicant’s proposed advanced degree program.  Final selection of awardees is made by the three participating DoD services:  the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the Army Research Office and the Office of Naval Research.  The current stipend amount starts at $30,500, prorated monthly based on a twelve-month academic year.  The present contract (F49620-02-C-0041) was awarded in August 2002.  The contract covers the administrative cost of the program and allows for transfer of funds (pass through funding) to the contractor to pay participants’ stipends and academic fees.  The present contract’s period of performance for the pass through funding is scheduled to end July 2005.  AFOSR plans to compete and issue a follow-on contract.  AFOSR is seeking qualified sources to provide the necessary personnel, accounting, administrative and database management services, and other resources required for the administration of the NDSEG Fellowship program.  The successful offeror will be required to work with the incumbent contractor, as necessary, to smoothly transition administration of the program, as well as be required to transition administration of the contract to a successor contractor when the contract performance period ends.  Functions required to administer the program include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:  advertising the NDSEG Fellowship program; soliciting qualified applicants; collect and receipt of applications in a secure electronic (online) format; distribution of applications among the disciplinary panels for evaluation to the three participating DoD services for selection; making offers of appointment to selected applicants and notifying unsuccessful applicants; administering payment of stipends to Fellows and payment of tuition and required fees to institutions; gathering and maintaining data, suitable for analysis and presentations, from current and former participants and unsuccessful applicants; organize a yearly NDSEG conference.  DoD anticipates awarding a minimum of one hundred (100) and a maximum of three hundred (300) new three-year NDSEG Fellows each fiscal year subject to the availability of funds.  AFOSR anticipates a contract with a potential length of seven years to cover five Fellowship classes.  Under the proposed contract, the administration provided by the contractor will be through a Cost Plus Fixed Fee arrangement, while the pass through funds for students’ stipends, tuition and fees will be through a Cost Reimbursable arrangement.  The proposed service North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS Code) is 56110, Management Services, size standard $5.0M.  Respondents should identify if they are a small disadvantaged business based on this NAICS code.  Interested sources are requested to provide a concise capability statement, limited to three pages, addressing past three years of experience relevant to the above described functions, to include:  experience in similar programs; knowledge of appropriate means to publicize the program and recruit participants; familiarity with issues related to conducting research in science and engineering; ability to attract university faculty members of the science and engineering community to serve on evaluation panels; cost accounting and financial management systems adequate to track costs, issue stipends and pay academic expenses; database management capabilities to gather and maintain data; and other resources necessary to conduct a program of this magnitude in a timely manner.  Reference to past customers for similar services should include organization name, point of contact name and telephone number.  Capability statements will be screened using the above described capabilities to identify qualified sources.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide capability statements no later than 17 Dec 04 to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Joseph Williams, at AFOSR/PK4, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, Virginia 22203-1977; or fax (703) 696-6240.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) will host an Industry Day for the Persistent Unmanned Maritime Airborne Surveillance Capability.  NAVAIR intends to release a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek proposals for research support in developing innovative solutions which provide persistent unmanned maritime airborne surveillance capability.   Concepts developed under the BAA may be considered in the development of future ISR mission system improvements.  The Navy’s desire is to develop ISR mission system enhancements for implementation in the 2012 timeframe, concurrent with other planned ISR improvements.  The Navy is in the process of recapitalizing its land-based maritime ISR capabilities, currently provided by the aging P-3 and EP-3 aircraft.  The Navy believes that the integration of manned and unmanned systems enables the creation of an overarching maritime architecture that can effectively enhance ISR mission performance and result in improved cost effectiveness.  The desired outcome of this study is a capability based definition and overarching systems architecture that will support the development of a family of systems approach to maritime ISR.  The Navy is developing alternative approaches to providing cost effective ISR capabilities and will consider deliverables from this effort as part of that process.
This Industry Day will provide an opportunity for Navy leadership to brief planned ISR program and mission system improvements to industry.  Additionally, NAVAIR will discuss BAA goals with industry, and conduct one-on-one dialogue with potential BAA prime offerors. The Industry Day will be conducted on 2 May 2005 at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Kossiakoff Center, 11100 Johns Hopkins Road, Laurel MD 20723-6099.  Directions and lodging options can be found at http://www.jhuapl.edu/aboutapl/facilities/facil_html/conference.html.  Attendees should plan to arrive between 0830 and 0900.  Industry Day will begin at 0900 and briefings will continue through 1200.  Lunch will be made available between 1200 and 1300 after which written questions may be answered.  Questions left unanswered may be answered and made available via the web at a later date. One-one-one meetings with potential primes will be conducted from 1330-1800.  If more one-on-one meetings are requested than time allows, additional meetings will be scheduled at a later date.  Attendance at Industry Day is limited to a maximum of 5 individuals per organization.  To register for Industry Day email Randal Marbury at randal.marbury@navy.mil.  The subject line of your email response shall read:  PUMAS Industry Day.  Responses shall include business name, address, attendee’s full name and a point of contact phone number.  Clearances are not required and all discussions will be unclassified.   Please note that Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory personnel will be in attendance during the one-on-one meetings. This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind.  The Navy will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by an offeror for travel expenses, presentations, marketing efforts or data offered for examination; therefore the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.

<DESC>The Government has a requirement to procure commercial off-the-shelf/non-developmental item (NDI) Multi-Functional Aiming Lights (MFAL) for both U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps units.  The MFAL will give the Soldier/Marine the capability to employ an  IR aiming laser/pointer and IR illuminator in a small, lightweight aiming light that is weapon-mounted or hand-held.  Desired, but not required, capabilities are a visible aiming laser and/or white light illuminator.  When weapon-mounted, the MFAL will pr ovide the Soldier/Marine a capability to accurately aim his weapon during periods of darkness when used with an image intensification device such as the AN/PVS-7, Night Vision Device, or the AN/PVS-14, Monocular Night Vision Device.  The MFAL shall incorpo rate a low power training mode for force-on-force training and a high power mode for combat operations.  In the low power mode, the IR aiming laser/pointer and IR illuminator shall have a Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance (NOHD) of less than 25m and shall hav e a range of 600m in clear, quarter moon conditions.  In the high power mode, the IR aiming laser/pointer and IR illuminator shall have a NOHD of less than 220m and shall have a range of 2000m in clear, quarter moon conditions.  If the IR illuminator is a fixed-beam type, a capability to diffuse the IR illuminator beam shall be provided, which will allow illumination of a 20x30x8 feet darkened room or enclosure.  If proposed, the visible aiming laser should be visible with the naked eye and have a minimum r ange of 25m in daylight (with daylight defined as that time between sunrise and sunset) but not in direct sunlight.  If proposed, the white light illuminator should provide facial recognition at a range of 25m inside a darkened room or enclosure.  The MFAL  shall have the capability to be quickly mounted to and dismounted from the M16A4 modular weapon, M4/M4A1, M240B, and M249 (threshold), M136, M203, MK19 and M2 (objective) and must be able to mount on a U.S. Army standard rail (MIL-STD-1913) using an inter face device.  The MFAL aiming lasers shall retain a zero position within 0.5 mrad after being subjected to the shock of one combat load (210 rounds/M855 ammunition) of the M4/M16 rifle.  The MFAL must have dual activation controls:  an on/off switch which shall be located on the device housing and a wired remote control switch which shall momentarily activate each of the functions i.e. IR aiming mode and IR illuminator mode.  The device will weigh no more than 10oz with batteries installed (threshold), 8oz (objective).  The MFAL System shall consist of the MFAL, a soft carrying case, MIL-STD-1913 interface mounting brackets, remote cable switch, batteries, operators/maintenance manual with detailed bore sight procedures included, and pattern generators for t he IR aiming laser.  The Government may award one or more, 5-year, Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a minimum quantity of 2,000 and a maximum quantity of 340,000 under full and open competition to meet u rgent requirements for deploying U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps combat units.

Description:

The General Services Administration, Federal Technology Service (GSA-FTS), on behalf of the Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP), is issuing this notice to inform industry that an initial RFQ (Phase I), for the Technology Insertion FY06 (TI-06) will be issued on or about May 20, 2005, with a subsequent on-half day information briefing on or about May 23, 2005.  Read-ahead draft versions of the RFQ (without the benchmark codes) may be released as early as 29 April.  The information briefing will include a general overview on the afternoon of May 23, beginning at 2:00 p.m. EDT, followed by vendor-specific, one-on-one information exchange meeting and question and answer sessions individually scheduled for May 24-25.  Each vendor will be allowed 30 minutes for their May 24-25 session.  A final RFQ (Phase II), is anticipated on or about September 12, 2005.  Phase I of the RFQ will be issued primarily to establish general pricing and related HPC technical capabilities that are deliverable on or before June 30, 2005.  Phase II of the RFQ will request offerors to provided detailed pricing, configuration, performance, maintenance, and delivery information for one or more specific HPC system configurations, all in response to a suite of DoD Benchmarks designed to demonstrate the capability of proposed systems to significantly improve the capabilities at HPCMP’s Major Shared Resource Centers and Distributed Centers.  The application benchmark codes that are anticipated to be included in the TI-06 application benchmark suite are recognized by the following names: Aero, AVUS, GAMESS, COBALT, CTH, HYCOM, LAMMPS, OOCore, Overflow-2, WRF.  Questions can be submitted to GSA at any time during the RFQ process.  Responses to the RFQ will only be considered from companies who:  (1) have offerings obtainable via existing GSA Contracts under Schedule 70 “General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, Services”; (2)  have demonstrated success in large scale manufacturing of commercially available, production HPC systems.  Furthermore, the Government financial appropriations associated with this acquisition do not permit the purchase of any supercomputer which is not manufactured in the United States; and (3) have clearances allowing access to sensitive DoD technology and facilities.

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information - Future Cargo Aircraft
<DESC>Executive Summary The US Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) desires industry comments regarding potential commercial FAA certified cargo aircraft to fulfill the Future Cargo Aircraft (FCA) role.  Of particular interest are comments about the aircraft performance capa bilities, contractor maintenance concepts and contractor training capabilities. Development of these comments is to be at no cost to the US government. Comments are to be submitted no later than 9 May 2005 in White Paper format (not proposal) accessible by Microsoft Word or EXCEL, PDF, and/or photo/picture files (bmp, JPEG, GIF).  E lectronic data submission is required.  Please contact debra.long@redstone.army.mil for further guidance or mail standard CD format disc to PEO Aviation, Attn:  SFAE-AV-AS-FW, Building 5308, Redstone Arsenal, AL, 35898-5000. Description On February 23, 2004, the U.S. Army announced the termination of the Comanche Helicopter Program.  As a result, the Army will restructure aviation organizations to reflect current and anticipated needs.  Specifically, the Army plans to procure 33 new FCA d uring the time period of FY07-FY11.  The FCA is a key component in the Armys transformation of its fixed wing fleet.  Fixed wing, multi-purpose, cargo aircraft will support a full range of sustainment operations and will transport time-sensitive/mission-critical supply items and/or personnel  over operational/tactical distances to forward-deployed troops, in remote and austere locations.  These fixed wing aircraft will normally operate from permanently established bases in the theater, and will operate as required from forward bases to include : Intermediate Staging Bases (ISB), theater aerial ports of debarkation (APOD), and airfields located near sea ports of debarkation (SPOD).  The FCA provides an order of magnitude improvement by replacing multiple Army platforms (i.e., C-23, C-26, and C- 12) and complementing existing joint capability with a single, more capable, airborne cargo platform.  To support the Future Force, the FCA will be a multifunctional aircraft, able to perform logistical resupply, casualty evacuation, troop movement, airdro p operations, humanitarian assistance, and missions in support of Homeland Security. To support the Future Force Brigade Combat Team (BCT), it will be necessary for mission-critical/time-sensitive supplies and key personnel to be delivered from intermediat e staging bases directly to the BCT, often operating in high threat environments in remote, austere locations. With dispersed forces operating at greater ranges in a non-contiguous battlespace, the range from the Forward Operating Bases (FOB) to the maneuv er units has extended beyond the logistical resupply range of the Armys rotary wing aircraft.  For aerial sustainment operations, the FCA will perform limited organic service support directly to the tactical maneuver units and/or the closest forward suppo rt base for further movement by Army rotary wing aircraft or ground transportation. The Fixed Wing Product Manager (FW PM) seeks information, comments and suggestions from manufacturers who intend to perform in a prime contractor role. For informational purposes only, the following notional contract schedule and quantities are provided: * Planned RFP release  1 Oct 2005  * Planned Early Operational Assessment 1 May  1 Jun 2006 * Planned Contract Award Jan 2007  * Planned Quantities  33 aircraft during FY 07-11.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  FERC05C50175 is issued as a request for proposal and all provisions/clauses are those in effect through FAC 01-25 correction. This solicitation is unrestricted under NAICS number 519190, All Other Information Services, and the size standard is $6,000,000.

Statement of Work:  1. INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requires a disaster recovery facility that supports the general support system (GSS) and e-Library systems Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) and the FERC Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). The facility must be activated and operational following the declaration of a disaster that disables the primary facility. The facility must be capable of hosting the GSS infrastructure and providing retrieval of documents for the eLibrary system via the internet using current eLibrary web interfaces.

2.  BACKGROUND.  The GSS provides core computing resources and functionality to FERC’s staff at its Washington D.C. location at 888 1st St., NE.  For the purpose of this RFP this includes email, network storage, Active Directory domain structure, and database hosting.  The eLibrary system (formerly known as FERRIS) is a database system that manages, stores, and retrieves documents that have been received or issued by the FERC after November 16, 1981, plus a very limited number of older document files and dockets that have been retrofitted into the system. There are currently 2.5 million documents in the system and about 1.6 million files that are referenced in the documents.

3. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORT. 3.1 Technical Requirements.  FERC has identified one option for creating a disaster recovery site. Offerors are encouraged to suggest their own interpretation on the selected option and the associated recovery time.  A general description follows:  Hot Standby. The contractor maintains a secondary site that meets all requirements but data is not synchronized and no traffic is directed to the site. In the event of a disaster data backups must be restored before traffic can be re-directed to the site. Recovery time should be within twelve to twenty-four hours of declaring an emergency.

Recovery time would optimally be within twelve to twenty-four hours of declaring an emergency. FERC is primarily concerned with a solution that is affordable and is secondarily concerned with the objective of restoring within an optimal timeframe. Offerors are encouraged to propose solutions that are comparable in cost to Warm Standby (equipment is on-hand or acquisition times are minimal), but innovative in addressing the 24 hour objective.
 

3.1.1 Infrastructure and Environmental requirements. In order to guarantee availability and support the recovery at a secondary location due to a disaster, certain minimal requirements exist.  The facility must not be within a 20 mile radius of the primary site (888 1st St.) and all equipment and all systems listed must have N+1 redundancy.  The contractor’s facility must provide the following:

•	Completely redundant and dedicated; 100Mb/s or higher Public Internet access; 
•	100Mb Ethernet switched backbone;
•	The network must be protected by a properly configured, stateful inspection, hardened operating system firewall with intrusion detection.  The firewall must also have the ability to create a standard IPSEC 3DES VPN with other firewalls.  Preferably a Cisco PIX firewall would be used;
•	Adequate facility security including features such as 24 hour a day manned and video security monitoring of the facility and access to the facility is restricted to facility customers and is verified with a combination of ID check, biometrics and/or a “man trap”.  Access to the FERC equipment shall be further restricted to FERC authorized individuals;
•	The facility must provide redundant A/C power and on site diesel generators with sufficient fuel to last for 2 days with contracts for additional fuel delivery
•	Access to the facility must be possible 24 hours a day 365 days a year to designated, authorized FERC personnel.
•	The facility must be able to maintain a temperature between 62 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit
•	The facility must have a multi-zone fire suppression system
•	To control flooding the facility must be built above sea level, without having equipment located in a basement, and with proper drainage and a moisture detection system
•	Facility must not be located in seismic zones 4 or 3 and must be location specific seismic compliant.  Non-structural components and equipment must be anchored and braced in accordance with the requirements of the 1997 Uniform Building Code

3.1.2. Hardware/Technical requirements. In addition to the requirements below, the contractor must have the ability to restore data from the following media types; DLT, SDLT, DAT, DLT4 and 12” 30GB Optical WORM (for FileNet).

3.1.2.1 GSS. The GSS can be broken down into several distinct components including; Exchange 2000, Active Directory, Network Storage, and database hosting.  Each of these components has their own technical design and hardware requirements.

Exchange 2000 is used by FERC to provide email functionality for its staff.  The system currently consists of 1,063 mailboxes with a total private storage totaling 133GB.  In the event of a disaster these mailboxes must be accessible from a remote location via the Internet using POP3, MAPI, and HTTP.  Security can be assured by creating a site to site VPN from the remote location to the DR facility.  When the disaster occurs, the entire current mailbox content will be restored to the secondary facility’s Exchange system.  When the disaster has passed and the system is being transitioned back to the primary facility all current content from the secondary facility will be imported.  To provide minimal functionality the system must have the following specifications:  Intel Dual 2.7 GHz, 3GB Ram, and 200GB storage.

FERC’s Active Directory infrastructure is required to provide authentication services as well as support the Exchange 2000 system.  Overall the AD system has approximately 5,000 objects, 100 organization units and 11 domain controllers.  During a disaster a VPN must be in place with the proper ports open to the remote location to allow authentication and communication with the AD domain controllers.  At a minimum two domain controllers will be required with the following specifications:  Intel Single 2.7 GHz, 2GB Ram, and 40GB storage.

Network storage must be made available via Windows network shares and provide a total 3TB of space.  Client systems must be able to access their data during the disaster utilizing the site to site VPN.   For remote users, a SharePoint Portal server will be used to provide secure web access to files in the network storage system.  The SharePoint server needs to have the following specifications:  Single 2.4Ghz, 1GB Ram, and 40GB of storage.  Additionally some users and regional offices will utilize a VPN client to connect through the secondary facility firewall to allow access to files and applications.

FERC has many online programs that depend on the functionality of their database systems.  All database systems are currently hosted on the Windows 2000 platform and consist of thirteen SQL 7.0, and four SQL 2000 databases with a combined total of 145GB of data.  The secondary facility will need to have two servers, one for each type of database system.  The SQL 2000 server needs to have a Single 2.4Ghz, 1GB Ram, and 140GB of storage.  The SQL 7.0 server should have a Single 2.4Ghz, 2GB Ram, and 160GB storage.  

 3.1.2.2 eLibrary. There are three servers that are required for minimal operation of the eLibrary system, the web server, Verity server, and FileNet/Oracle server.  Each of these systems must meet or exceed the specifications of the current systems and the applications that are to be installed on them.  In addition to these requirements each system must have access to a shared super DLT320 tape drive or its own in order to facilitate the restoration of data from the primary site.  Each system must be of sufficiently small form factor so as not to incur additional costs due to space requirements in the cabinet.  Each system must also utilize RAID 1 or 5 in achieving the required drive space.

The web server must be a rack mountable Pentium single processor 2.4 GHz or higher with 2GB of RAM.  This system will be running Windows 2000, fully patched with sufficient virus protection.  Additionally it must have at least 2GB of free hard drive space not including the operating system.

The Verity server must be a rack mountable dual processor Pentium 3GHz or higher with 2GB of RAM.  This system should be running Windows 2000 server, fully patched with sufficient virus protection.  Additionally it must have at least 90GB of free hard drive space not including the operating system.

The FileNet/Oracle server must be a rack mountable dual processor 64bit 1.2 GHz or higher with 2 GB of RAM.  This system should be running AIX 5.2.  It must also have at least 1.2TB of internal or external storage available not including the operating system to load the optical disks into cache.

The FileNet system must have a direct connection to an optical jukebox with a 12” 30GB drive to facilitate loading of the FileNet cache to the hard drive or the ongoing access to 40 optical platters for document retrieval.

3.1.3 Software requirements. 3.1.3.1 GSS. The following commercial software must be installed and maintained for minimal operational status of the GSS.  All software will be provided by FERC.

•	Microsoft Exchange 2000
•	Windows 2000 Server
•	Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) version 81
•	Microsoft SQL 7.0

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combine synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number FDA-SOL-05-00040 and the solicitation are issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  This acquisition is unrestricted as to the size of the business.  The NAICS Code is 541990 and size standard is $6 million. All interested parties are invited to submit a quotation for the following requirement: 
BACKGROUND:
One of the missions of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is to monitor the safety of marketed medical devices.  The current monitoring systems in place rely on adverse event reporting.  Several studies have shown significant rates of underreporting.   New monitoring systems that could be developed include routine searches of various data sources such as hospital discharge codes, electronic hospital records, or emergency room records.  Unfortunately, studies currently underway show that attempts to create such systems will all fail to capture rates of adverse device events because device-specific medical information is not routinely documented in medical records.  In other words, both device use and problems related to device use are not adequately recorded in patient charts.  For most of the instances when device use and device-related problems are recorded, information about the specific device and the nature of the problem is inadequate.  
Good documentation of both device use and device problems is necessary for scientifically investigating the safety of devices.  For patient safety reporting of adverse device events, it is essential that information on device utilization be routinely documented.  For improving patient safety, reports of adverse device events may be lead to analysis of the use of all or a sample of a particular device to obtain information about the likelihood of such events and may lead to patient follow-up by providers of their patients using such devices.  In these cases, having unique device identification in the patients’ medical records, and pointers to a data base for information about that specific device is necessary.  
There are many barriers to good routine documentation: lack of awareness of the need to document, lack of financial incentive, lack of knowledge of how to describe particular devices, and lack of time for documentation.  Since the barriers are multi-factorial, a multifaceted solution to the problem of poor documentation will probably be required.  Simple exhortations to busy providers to write down more information are unlikely to be effective.  An example of new solutions to be considered includes the development of “smart” technology as an effective and inexpensive way to set up automatic documentation of device use, especially in adverse event situations.
One way to examine and facilitate potential solutions to the issue of medical device identification and routine documentation is to bring experts from the relevant fields together to discuss the problem and recommend actions.  A separate effort is underway to improve the nomenclature and identification of devices.  This current effort regards routine documentation.  Because of the possibility that one or two dominant personalities could steer the course of a workshop, two workshops will be held to increase the range of ideas that are expressed by the participants.  Participants will be chosen from the fields of drug epidemiology, health services research, health care insurance, information technology, clinical data standards and technology, human factors engineering, social science, medical device manufacture, medical device regulation, and high technology development and engineering.  Sectors to be represented include non-FDA federal government, professional societies, consumer groups, academia, health care providers, health care payers, third party health research contractors, information technology firms, and technology development entrepreneurs.  The workshops will need to be facilitated by people with a broad understanding of medical devices.  Each workshop should have a relatively small number of participants to encourage conversation.
PROJECT PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this project is to work with people and organizations who are interested in furthering device documentation, patient safety, and the exchange of device information, and who understand health care delivery and are developing new technologies.  We want to stimulate and record their ideas regarding the encouragement and enabling of routine documentation of medical device use.  The best vehicle for this work is through targeted workshops.
SCOPE OF WORK:
Provide professional services to organize, recruit non-CDRH participants, host, facilitate, and document two workshops to brainstorm and obtain feedback on ways to encourage and develop routine documentation of medical device use and medical device related problems. These workshops would be held with CDRH and invited members of industry, government and academia.
Tasks for each of two workshops:
(1)	The length of each workshop will be one and one-half days.  The dates will be determined by the contractor in consultation with the Project Officer.  Each workshop will include approximately 10 to 15 invitees from outside CDRH and up to 6 from inside CDRH.  The non-CDRH invitees will be different at each workshop.  The distribution of background profiles of the invitees will be approximately similar for each of the workshops.  The background profiles will be distributed among three dimensions in a way that maximizes the diversity of the participants.  The first dimension is field: drug epidemiology, health services research, health care insurance, information technology, clinical data standards and technology, human factors engineering, social science, medical device manufacture, medical device regulation, and high technology development and engineering.  The second dimension is economic sector: non-FDA federal government (including health care providers and health care payers), non-profit private organizations (including professional societies, consumer groups, health care providers, and academia), and for-profit private organizations (including academia, health care providers, health care payers, third party health research contractors, information technology firms, and technology development entrepreneurs).  The third dimension is academic degree: bachelor, master, and doctoral.  The fourth dimension is years of relevant work experience: less than 5, 5 to 19, and 20 or more.  All invitees should exhibit evidence of being highly creative. (2) Working with the Project Officer, the contractor will identify invitees, issue invitations, offer travel advice, and, as appropriate, offer honoraria to cover reasonable travel expenses and induce attendance.  Some invitees will not require an honorarium.  The contractor will need to judge the appropriate level of honorarium to offer each invitee. (3) At least two weeks prior to the workshop, participants of the workshop will be sent background material to review.  The material will describe the current state of routine documentation of device use and device related problems, explain the need for improvement, include a preliminary agenda, and provide travel information.  One copy of the background materials will be provided to the contractor by the Project Officer. (4) The contractor will set up an appropriate meeting space large enough to comfortably accommodate all participants for formal presentations and group discussion.  The meeting space must be in the Washington, DC, Metropolitan area and within 3 city blocks of a Metro stop.  If the proposed meeting space is further from a Metro stop, the contractor will provide transportation from a Metro stop. (5) The contractor will provide, set up, and troubleshoot the required audiovisual equipment (at least two microphones and a Windows-based laptop-projector combination) and printed agendas. (6) Each workshop will begin in the morning with prepared presentations covering the background materials.  In the first afternoon, the contractor will facilitate 2 simultaneous brainstorming groups, each in separate rooms, to address specific questions.  The specific questions will have been developed in advance by the Project Officer and the contractor.  In the evening, the contractor will prepare synopses of the brainstorm results.  The second morning will begin with contractor presentation of the brainstorm results, and conclude with discussion by all the attendees. (7) Since work will continue through both morning breaks, afternoon break, and lunch on the first day, meals and break refreshments will be provided by the contractor.  The contractor will accommodate special dietary needs. (8) The contractor will deliver a transcript (PDF format) and report (PDF and Microsoft Word formats) of each workshop to the Project Officer within one month of the workshop.  The report will include the findings, proposed ideas, and decisions, if any.  The contractor will have the option of including their own recommendations.  
The contractor will send to each participant and post on its website an FDA-approved PDF-format electronic report of the two workshops.  Any further publication will be jointly agreed to by the Project Officer and contractor.

CRYSTAL GATE NORTH MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM (AUDIO VIDEO SYSTEM)
RFP HQ0050-05-T-0003 

Questions &  Answers

Para 3.3: "The facilities construction crew will add 4 floor boxes for data, power, and voice connectivity". 

1.  Question: What is the manufacturer and model number of the floorboxes that are provided?

1.  Answer:   The contractor will be installing six (6) of the type RC-3 floor boxes and one (1) of the FRS-500.  These two (2) types of floor boxes are the only boxes that will be installed by the contractor.    

 
Para 3.4: "The conference room tables will include phone lines to support 12 people sitting at the tables along with at least 4 phone lines against one of the walls." 

2.  Question: Is it a correct assumption that phones and phone lines are installed by others? If not, please articulate AV contractor's responsibilities in this area.

2.  Answer:   Yes, the phones and lines will be installed by others.  Neal Jacobson will be in charge of having the telephone contractor pull all phone lines as required.


Para 3.2 states: "The system can include dual 35-50? plasma screens." Para 3.4 states: "A 61? or larger wall mounted plasma display screen is required to be mounted on the rear wall for video presentations." 

3.  Question: It appears that a fixed plasma display at the rear of the room is required and plasma displays at the front of the room are desired but not required. Is this correct?

3.  Answer:   We are not experts in engineering an AV multipurpose room and that is why this contract is out for bids.  We have requested a 10 x 10 projection screen to be located on one wall and have included electricity outlet in ceiling to support the projector.  If this is not conducive for VTC or training and a better solution is recommended (e.g., projection screen & plasma mounted on the same wall) we are willing to review these as options/recommendations.


Para 3.3 states: "This requirement also includes four or possibly 5 conference tables to be furnished by the contractor that must be easily collapsible and removable." 

4.  Question: Could you please provide a sketch showing what you want for tables and seating arrangements so properly sized tables can be provided? Also, we interpret this as tables only, not chairs, credenzas or other furnishings. Please verify.

4.  Answer:   The table configurations are dependent where the floor boxes are installed.  We do want wheels/brakes on the tables so they can remain stationary or collapse and become portable.  Since the room is mult-purpose it should support U-Shape for VTC & meetings and classroom style configurations.


Para 3.5 requires a Hi-Fi: 

5.  Question: There is no item of AV equipment called a "Hi-Fi". Please define what you want for this item.

5.  Answer:   Hi-Fi VCR


Para 3.5:states: "On the cabinet there should be space and wall jacks for 4 phones." 

6.  Question: Please provide phone manufacturer and model OR provide phone dimensions so we can insure that there is adequate space. 

6.  Answer:    Verizon Model #MLX10 


Para 5.1 states: "SECRET clearances and United States citizenship are required for all contractor personnel that support this delivery order." Para 2.1 states: "Support activities include providing documentation, training, and support for 1 year." 

7.  Question: It appears that personnel who install the system are not required to have security clearances but those who provide service and maintenance are required to have security clearances. Is this correct? 

7.  Answer:   While the suite is under construction a SECRET clearance is not required.  Once completed and accredited we don't want to have to provide escort.  Since the installation requires integrating both Unclassified and Classified networks the person who integrates and supports this effort should have a SECRET clearance.


Para 6.2 requires Bi-Weekly Status Reports. 

8.  Question: The Merriam-Webster online Dictionary defines biweekly (Bi-weekly is not a word) as occurring every two weeks and also as occurring twice a week. Which do you mean? Is this for the entire contract period or just the installation phase?

8.  Answer:   Bi The prefix bi followed by a hyphen can be found in any dictionary.  Using http://www.dictionary.com the word can be spelled bi-weekly or biweekly and means "Happening every two weeks".  Bi-weekly report should be provided the entire contract period.

5.  Business Volume Content:   Executive Summary, BID SAMPLE prices, offeror identification information, CLIN 0001 price information for specified delivery order increments, CLIN 0002 price for delivery to Quantico VA, CLIN 0003 replacement part prices (assume a quantity of 100 for each item, but price by the “each”),  CLIN 0004 price for a two-day training package including classroom and live fire sessions conducted at Quantico VA, CLIN 0005 prices will vary by vendor, delivery schedule,  Past Performance Matrix, FAR Part 52.212-3 Form (NOT the SECTION K Form).

This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (as defined in Far part 2.1) prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Solicitation M67854-05-R-1043 is a Request for Proposal (RFP) and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-02 and DFARS Change Notice 20050323.  On behalf of the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS) this notice requests proposals for the procurement of the Scout Sniper Day Scope (SSDS) for the M40A3 and M82A3 rifles. The SSDS is being procured utilizing full and open, best value competition.  A separate RFP for a scope mounting system will be issued immediately following award of the SSDS. The Government intends to award two separate contracts: one for the M40A3 SSDS, and another for the M82A3 SSDS; however, in the event a single offeror proposes one scope that meets the requirements of both the M40A3 and the M82A3, a single Offeror may be awarded both contracts (reference Section 3.7.2 of the Purchase Description).  The Government anticipates issuing Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts (DPAS rated DO-A5) to the successful offeror(s) representing the best value to the Government. The Government intends to award both contracts prior to 15 July 05; however, due to test range availability, the M40A3 SSDS will likely be awarded approximately 30 days prior to the M82A3 SSDS. The provisions at FAR Part 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items apply to this acquisition.  All future information relative to this procurement, including all documentation such as the Purchase Description, Statement of Work (SOW), SSDS Performance Metric Matrix, Contract Data Requirements Lists, Past Performance Matrix, and FAR Part 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Template  will be available to industry through the MARCORSYSCOM website: http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/ctq/opport.asp.  Offerors shall submit separate technical and business proposals along with (5) product (bid) samples with their proposal for the M40A3 and (5) product (bid) samples with their proposal for the M82A3 as an element of their offer.  OFFERORS SHALL STATE THE PRICE OF THE BID SAMPLES ON PAGE 1 OF THE BUSINESS VOLUME.  Offerors submitting proposals for both the M40A3 SSDS and the M82A3 SSDS shall provide separate proposals for the two scopes (i.e., a business volume and a technical volume for each scope, 4 volumes total). The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with FAR Part 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items as detailed below. Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR Part 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, with their offers. The clause at FAR Part 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.  
CLIN STRUCTURE
The Government intends to utilize the following Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure, but actual CLIN structure may vary as a result of the individual selected offeror(s)’ proposal(s). 0001 – SSDS, M40A3, or SSDS, M82A3 (as appropriate), includes packaging;
0002 – Miscellaneous Handling and Shipping (TBD – may include overseas locations, such as Okinawa, Japan);
0003 – Replacement parts;
0003AA, etc. – List applicable replacement parts;
0004 – Training package;
0005 – Contractor level repair;
0005AA – List applicable levels of repair;
MINIMUM / MAXIMUM PURCHASES:
The minimum purchase for the M40A3 SSDS is 600 units.  The maximum purchase for the M40A3 SSDS is 10,000 units.  The Program Office initially intends to procure 600 units of the M40A3 SSDS with a potential to procure more as other Government sources show an interest.  The minimum purchase for the M82A3 SSDS is 100 units.  The maximum purchase for the M82A3 SSDS is 7,500 units. .  The Program Office initially intends to procure 100 units of the M82A3 SSDS with a potential to procure more as other Government sources show an interest.    Minimum and Maximum purchase information for CLINs 0002-0005 will be negotiated with the selected offeror(s).  This contract shall be in effect for five years from the date of award.  
EVALUATION:
The Government intends to complete an initial evaluation based on a review of written proposals and an examination of bid samples.  The Government may consider an Offeror’s noncompliance with the instructions set forth in this document to be indicative of the type of conduct the Government may expect from the Offeror during contract performance. If the Offeror intends to modify their bid sample (in the event of contract award) to meet the requirements of this solicitation, the offeror must clearly state the intended modifications in the technical volume of their proposal and demonstrate how the stated modifications will meet the Government requirements.  Following the initial evaluation, the Government intends to establish a competitive range (which may be limited for purposes of efficiency), at which time the Government will conduct optical performance tests, environmental tests, and a Limited User Evaluation (information concerning scope mounts to be utilized during the LUE is detailed in the Purchase Description) and may hold discussions in accordance with FAR 15.306. The Government will reimburse Offerors, whose proposals are included in the competitive range, for their bid samples.  Bid samples, for Offerors whose proposals are not included in the competitive range, will be returned to the respective Offerors at Government expense in a manner similar to that in which the bid samples were shipped to the Government. In making its “best value” determination, the Government will consider the following non-cost/price factors, in order of descending importance (from most to least important):  (1) Technical Capability, (2) Integrated Logistics Support, and (3) Past Performance.  (For the purpose of this source selection, the evaluation of “quality” as a factor is considered to be inherent in Technical Capability and Past Performance). The Government will assign an acceptability rating for and assess the risk associated with each factor for every proposal.  In accordance with Section 3.7 of the SSDS Purchase Description, evaluation credit will be given for technical solutions exceeding mandatory minimums.  The factors listed above, when combined, are significantly more important than price; however, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination increases with the degree of equality in the overall technical merit of the proposals.  As such, price will be evaluated, but not rated.  The Government intends to consider estimated Life Cycle Costs when evaluating price.

TECHNICAL VOLUME CONTENT.  
Offerors shall be required to address each requirement listed in the RFP.  Offerors shall show that their product meets all KPPs and provide any data available to substantiate their claims. Offerors shall further submit a Certificate of Compliance with the bid samples, certifying that all requirements have been met (reference Section 4.3.3 of the Purchase Description). Offerors may use product literature in their technical proposals; however, any ambiguities noted in the technical capability of the products may have an adverse impact on proposal evaluation.  The technical volume portion of the proposal shall be specific, detailed, and comprehensive enough to enable technical personnel to make a thorough evaluation of its contents.  All ILS items shall be addressed in the Technical Volume.  Additionally offerors should address any Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) items such as non-warranty repair, training, etc. in the Technical Volume. 

BUSINESS VOLUME CONTENT.
The Business volume shall include a one-page Executive Summary briefly describing the overall technical approach. Offerors shall include: Contractor Name, Address, DUNS, Cage Code, and Tax Identification Number (TIN). Offerors shall be required to provide price information for each of the quantity increments listed below.  The first 600 M40A3 SSDSs and the first 100 M82A3 SSDSs should be delivered not later than 150 days after receipt of first delivery order. DELIVERY ORDER INCREMENTS:
1-50,
51-100,
101-200,
201-400,
401-700,
701-1,000.
The unit price of each delivery order will be determined by the number of units ordered on a given delivery order.  Individual orders will be issued using the single price for the increment that corresponds to the total quantity being purchased on that order. Additionally, offerors shall provide price information for replacement parts (lens covers, turrets caps, scope covers, etc) associated with their proposed scope(s) under CLIN 0003.  Offerors shall separately price any proposed Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) items being offered under CLINs 0004 and 0005, as appropriate.  The Government reserves the right to purchase all, part, or none of the selected Offeror’s proposed CLS items. All cost and price information shall be rounded to the nearest dollar. Offerors shall include the past performance information, detailed below, in their Business Volume.  

PAST PERFORMANCE:  
The Government will collect and evaluate past performance information using OSD AT&L, A Guide to Collection and Use of Past Performance Information, Version 3 as a guide. 
Offerors shall provide at least three specific examples of favorable, recent past performance that illustrates evidence of their ability to produce, deliver, and warrant this product.  Offerors shall ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number, and a description of the items procured.  Offerors without at least three specific examples of recent past performance (i.e., a new entrant into the market) will receive not less than a "neutral" rating in Past Performance.  Offerors shall include past performance in their Business Volume.  Past Performance information shall be submitted via the past performance matrix.

SUBMISSION CRITERIA: Offerors should read the terms and conditions of this solicitation carefully and refer any questions to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO).  Proposals shall be prepared using “Arial” or “Times New Roman” 12-point font style on 8 ½ x 11inch white paper.  Tables and illustrations may use a reduced font style, not less than 8 points.

	3.		Award may be made without further negotiations.  Proposal should be submitted initially in the most favorable terms, from a price and technical standpoint, which the Offeror can submit to the Government.
