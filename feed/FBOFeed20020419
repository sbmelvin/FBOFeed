<DESC>NA CONTACT Kenneth Shedlock, Project Manager Engineer, 732 532-5549.  This is a market survey to determine the availability of a commercial foldable stool.  These -drafting-type -stools will be used as seats for soldiers inside a mobile electronics maintenanc e shop van shelter that possesses work stations for performing electronic maintenance, similar to a workshop type environment.  The height of the existing worktable surface is 37 inches from the floor; the old stools that were previously being used are 27 inches high.  Seat backs are not required.  Foldable stools are required to allow stowage in the least amount of space.  Regular non-foldable stools take up a large space during transport, and take away critical storage space that can be utilized for missi on-essential equipment.  A padded-cushioned seat is not required, this type of material will wear out after much use in a tactical environment.  Approximate quantities of these foldable stools that our program requires is 2,000. The vendor shall provide - the government - a spec sheet-company catalog sheet of the above commercially-available furniture, preferably via email. CECOM POC is Ken Shedlock, 732 532-5549, FAX 732 532-3294.   Email address: kenneth.shedlock@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.  The deadline for response to this notice is 10 May 2002.

The Contractor shall be responsible for developing a training plan and shall assist in the plan?s implementation.  To implement the plan, the Contractor shall arrange for and conduct training conferences; shall participate in satellite broadcasts; shall develop a training manual; shall publish articles and brochures; and shall participate in post-training conference activities such as providing answers to questions that arise during the period of performance of this contract.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Control and Data Acquisition System Equipment to be used on the FAST (FRC Acceleration Space Thruster) Experiment, undertaken within the Propulsion Research Center. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from National Instruments Corporation. pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) The Propulsion Research Center is predominantly equipped with control and data acquisition equipment from National Instruments.  In order to be compatible with this equipment, and to leverage the most value out of the previous purchases, it is necessary to obtain components for an upgraded system from the same vendor.  (b) This equipment is needed as soon as possible so as to conduct experiments necessary to evaluate concepts for MSFC proposals on upcoming NRAs.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. local time on May 6, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/KSC intends to contract on a sole-source basis for gaseous nitrogen requirements (GN2) at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), located on the Atlantic Coast of East Central Florida.  The required GN2 must meet or exceed MIL-PRF-27401D, Type I, Grade B.  The approximate quantity of GN2 required per year is 1,800,000 thousand standard cubic feet (MCF). The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The incumbent contractor is Air Liquide America Corporation of Houston, Texas.  Air Liquide operates an air separation facility adjacent to KSC that feeds into the KSC/CCAFS GN2 pipeline system.  Portions of the pipeline are owned by Air Liquide and the government, respectively.  Air Liquide is the identified sole source for this contract.  A description of this pipeline can be viewed at the following internet website:   http://propellants.ksc.nasa.gov/gn2pipeline.htm  NASA expects to award a contract to commence on July 1, 2002, with a 3-year basic period of performance and 2 one-year option periods.  The government will consider offers from sources other than Air Liquide.  It is assumed that any source other than Air Liquide would require at least 1 to 2 years to construct the necessary infrastructure (on-site or near-site) to supply GN2 into the pipeline.  The government will consider making sufficient government property available for a contractor to build the necessary facilities to supply GN2 into the government-owned portion of the pipeline for a subsequent contract.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".

This action is to procure a FAAD C2 System consisting of four  (4) each AN/TSQ-184D Battery Command Posts, four (4) each FAAD C2 Sensor Nodes, and supporting hardware, training and spare parts.   TRW, Inc. is the prime contractor for the Forward Area Air Defense Command, Control, and Intelligence (FAAD C2I) System.  FAAD C2I software is still being developed by TRW, Inc.; maintenance of existing software and procurement of software upgrades and new  software versions can only be provided by TRW, Inc.  TRW, Inc., proprietary software is utilized in the FAAD C2 Systems.  TRW, Inc., owns intellectual property rights to all the FAAD C2I software, and the Government only has the unrestricted rights to use  of the software by the U.S. Army.  TRW is the only contractor with the critical expert technical knowledge of FAAD C2 System software required to effectively develop, produce and support FAAD C2 Systems for FMS.  Unique software must be developed for FMS to support the FAAD C2 systems as certain elements in existing software are not exportable.  Only TRW, Inc. has the unique technical knowledge and capability required to develop compatible new software that will facilitate the effective operation of the FA AD C2I Systems.   TRW, Inc., is the only contractor with the proven in-place engineering/corporate knowledge and capability to meet the development, production and support of FAAD C2 Systems and ultimately the FMS case schedule.  Since TRW, Inc. has propri etary rights to FAAD C2 System software, it would be impossible for any other contractor to perform this contract .  No other sources will be sought for this effort.  TRW, Inc. is the developer of all software for FAAD C2I.  This software contains proprietary software design/codes, which cannot be obtained from any other source.  Subcontracting opportunities should be di rected to TRW, Inc.

These training courses are highly specific to OTS' mission of regulating the nation's Thrift industry.  Dr. Handorf  will use his extensive knowledge of the Thrift industry and his past performance experience in this area to develop and teach these courses to OTS' thrift examination staff which consists of approximately 750 examiners throughout the United States.  

Course topics must include, but not be limited to:

Interest Rate Risk Analysis using the OTS NAP Model;
Bank examination procedures;

Development and presentation of courses must at least be at the examiner skill and knowledge level needed for accreditation required to obtain the level of examiner that would attend these training classes.

Prior to presentation, contractor is to provide a detailed outline of each course and identify teaching methods and class activities that will be used.  Straight lecture will not be acceptable.

No solicitation document exists for this requirement.  A single contractor or small business with the knowledge, experience, and documented past performance of developing and providing the training courses identified in this announcement is requested to email a capabilities statement to james.harden@ots.treas.gov or fax to 202-906-5648.  Vendor is to describe how it can fully meet the requirements stated above, inclusive of past performance information.  



If no responses are received with 15 days of this announcement, the OTS will proceed with sole source negotiations with Dr. Handorf.  The anticipated contract will be a base year with 4 one year options plus an additional option of up to 6 months.  The dollar range of this requirement is $200,000 to $250,000.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to set up central NIDDK facilities for archival storage of biosamples and data collected in large, multi-site studies.  In addition, there is a need for a central genetic sample facility to serve the needs of new studies by providing uniform high-quality laboratory and archiving services.  Central archival repositories will enhance the value of large studies by increasing access to the biosamples and data that have been collected.  Investigators seeking to reanalyze biosamples and/or data from NIDDK-funded large studies will be able to direct their inquiries to a single central entity, rather to numerous laboratories with individual storage and access policies.  Thus, when appropriate, researchers will be able to obtain samples and/or data expeditiously and efficiently.

Objectives:
The repositories will serve three separate functions:
1)	Biosample repository - Gathering, storing, and distributing samples from studies.  The repository will work with investigators in new and ongoing studies to implement an appropriate labeling, aliquoting and storage system that will facilitate the transfer of the biosamples.  In some instances, the repository may be directed to acquire samples from studies already completed.
2)	Data repository ? Consulting with new and ongoing studies to prepare research data for eventual use by others.  Working with studies and other contractors to develop sample labeling and information exchange systems.  Gathering, storing and distributing the complete, finished datasets associated with archived biosamples from completed studies, and helping researchers carry out simple searches of stored datasets.  Creating and maintaining the website for the NIDDK Central Repositories.
3)	Genetics repository - Providing support services for genetics studies, including cell line immortalization, DNA extraction and storage.

Potential offerors may propose on one or more of the projects.  A public pre-solicitation meeting was held on November 28,2001.  A transcript of this meeting may be obtained at www.niddk.nih.gov/fund/repository/trnscrpt_1101.pdf.
 
The Request for Proposals, RFP NIH-NIDDK-02-04 will be issued on May 6, 2002 and proposals are due by 3:00 p.m., August 5, 2002.   To receive a copy of this RFP, please make your request in writing to Ms. Marlene Mireles, Contract Specialist, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Suite 772, Bethesda, Maryland 20817, telephone number: 301-594-8831.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Environmental Technologies Lab (ETL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S. C. 253(c)(1) with Elight Laser Systems GMBH, Warthestr 21, D 14513 Teltow, Germany to lease a stand-alone ozone lidar.  ETL will be participating in the NOAA New England Air Quality and Temperature Forecasting Pilot Program.  Part of this program is an observational study that will be conducted in the northeastern US in conjunction with the New England AIRMAP Air Quality Study in July and August of 2002.  One of NOAA/ETL's roles in the Forecasting Pilot Program is to provide vertical profiles of ozone in the lower troposphere on a continuous basis during the month-long intensive measurement period.  To fulfill its obligations, NOAA/ETL requires a lease of an unattended, stand-alone ozone lidar that is capable of measuring vertical profiles of ozone and aerosol in the lowest 2 kilometers of the atmosphere.  For the success of the project it is important that the lidar data are available to other participating researchers in near-real time.  The lidar will be deployed upstream of the New England study area collocated with a radar wind profiler to characterize the transport of pollutants into the New England area from sources in the Midwest and Ohio River Valley.  The data gathered with the lidar will be used to verify air quality forecast models and to assess whether assimilating continuous upper-air profiles of pollutants, such as ozone and aerosols, will result in performance improvements of air quality forecast models.  The lidar system to be leased shall be capable of measuring vertical profiles of ozone concentration and aerosol backscatter or extinction in the lower atmosphere. The minimum altitude at which data can be retrieved shall be 200 m above ground or less and the maximum altitude shall be approx. 2 km or more.  The vertical resolution shall be on the order of 200 m for ozone concentration and 30 m for aerosol backscatter/extinction; the time resolution shall be 60 minutes or better for both, ozone and aerosol profiles.  The absolute accuracy and precision of the ozone measurements shall be approximately10 ppbv or better at all altitudes.  It is required that the lidar is eyesafe, operates unattended, and provides profiles of ozone concentration and aerosol backscatter/extinction continuously during the month-long intensive measurement period (except for periods of inclement weather, such as fog, low clouds, and rain).  The lidar shall be a stand-alone system in a weather-protective housing, only requiring power hookup at the deployment site.  Routine maintenance of the system shall not be needed more often than once a week.  The lidar system shall be equipped with a computer to store the raw data at 5-minute resolution or better.  The data storage medium shall be large enough to allow archival of the data from the entire, month-long experiment.  It is also required that the lidar is equipped with a modem to allow data transfer to a remote location and to remotely diagnose system performance using the built-in computer.  A data analysis program package allowing the retrieval of ozone and aerosol profiles shall be part of the system.  The lidar to be leased (also referred to here as the "unattended ozone lidar") shall be deployed at a site in western New York State and be fully operational from 12 July through 10 August 2002.  From 24 ? 28 June 2002, the lidar shall be set up and demonstrated at the NOAA/ETL laboratory in Boulder, Colorado.  During this visit, intercomparison measurements between the unattended ozone lidar and the NOAA/ETL research ozone lidar shall be conducted.  In addition, it is required that the vendor of the unattended ozone lidar trains NOAA/ETL personnel on how to operate the lidar, perform routine maintenance, and analyze the data.  The vendor shall provide transportation of the lidar to Boulder, Colorado, from Boulderto the deployment site in New York State, and transportation away from the site in New York State.  Setup, initial alignment and testing, as well as teardown of the unattended ozone lidar, both in Boulder and at the measurement site in New York State, shall be the responsibility of the vendor.  NOAA/ETL personnel shall perform data transfer and analysis, as well as routine system maintenance during the measurement campaign in July and August of 2002.  Any non-routine maintenance or system repairs shall be performed by the vendor and be carried out in a timely manner to minimize system downtime during the intensive measurement campaign.  Expenses associated with system repairs, such as costs for parts, labor, and travel, as well as costs for consumables for the duration of the lease period shall be covered by the vendor.  Payment for electrical and phone services as well as other costs associated with the preparation of the New York State deployment site shall be the responsibility of NOAA/ETL.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100,000).  FAR Clauses in full text are at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/ .  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned. No award will be made on the basis of request in response to this notice.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.

Background
The primary function of the program and all components is to train students for job placement, and to place them in jobs.  This training is accomplished with a mandatory emphasis on zero tolerance for drugs and violence.

Job Corps is a major employment and training program that attempts to alleviate the severe employment problems faced by disadvantaged youth throughout the United States. The Job Corps was established by the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Control of the program was transferred from the Office of Economic Opportunity to the Department of Labor in 1969.  Workforce Investment Act maintains Job Corps as a national program for at risk youth, with emphasis placed on greater involvement of Job Corps Centers with local communities, employers and other Workforce investment programs and services. The program is administered at the Federal level through the Employment and Training Administration, Office of Job Training Programs (OJTP), Office of Job Corps in Washington, D.C., and Regional Offices.

The typical youth served by Job Corps is an 18 year-old high school dropout who reads at the elementary school level, comes from a poor family, belongs to a minority group, and has been unemployed for many weeks or has never held a job. Job Corps provides educational and vocational skills training, work experience counseling, health care, and other support services. The aim of the program is to help youth become responsible adults, prepare for and obtain a suitable job, career and return to school for further training.  Currently, the program serves students between the ages of sixteen (16) and twenty-four (24).

The PRH is constantly under modification and updating.  Therefore, the PRH may vary over the span of this contract.  Modifications of programs may be required as changes in the PRH occur.  Additional programs such as Vocation, Counseling and student related services or other functions may be required.  Close coordination and cooperation with Center management and other Center entities is essential.  Close working experience and contact with the Oregon implementation of the Workforce Investment Act is mandatory.

<DESC>Engineering Services are required to perform a Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) Study and Implementation on a limited number of systems to be selected by the contractor and subject to Government concurrence at the Naval Submarine Base, New London, Groton, CT.  The objective of the study is to apply integrated RCM strategies to maximize facility and equipment reliability while minimizing life-cycle costs. The RCM study will provide the Navy with the optimum mix of reactive, time-or interval-based, predictive-based, and proactive maintenance practices for a limited number of systems at the Submarine Base.  The objective of the implementation phase of the effort is to demonstrate the return on investment of the recommendations made in the study. 

The study shall include but not be limited to the four principles of RCM defined and applied to facilities maintenance as the integration of reactive maintenance (run-to-failure or breakdown maintenance), preventive (interval based) maintenance, Predictive Testing and Inspection (PT&I) (condition based), and proactive maintenance.  Techniques used in applying the principles of RCM shall include but not be limited to the following:  (1)  Age Exploration to determine the most effective intervals for maintenance tasks, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to determine what parts fail, why they usually fail, and what effect their failure has on the systems in total, (2) Predictive Maintenance (PdM) to monitor system performance and/or use of condition monitoring technologies, (3) Preventive/Interval Maintenance to determine time- or cycle-based actions performed to prevent failure, monitor condition, or inspect for failure, and (4) Root Cause Failure Analysis (RCFA) to explore all possible causes related to a machine failure.  

Specific work items of the study will include:  
(1) Develop a detailed list on a limited number of systems/components/devices on infrastructures such as piers, HVAC systems, steam generation and distribution systems, and electrical generation and distribution systems selected by the contractor and subject to Government concurrence to which the principles of RCM (preventive, proactive, predictive and reactive maintenance) can be applied; 
(2) Provide examples of items in private industry and other government agencies that are maintained using RCM that are similar to the items developed in paragraph (1).  Also provide the specific RCM procedures used by private industry and other government agencies on the items identified. 
(3) Develop a prioritized list of recommendations with the top priority being the highest potential payback item; 
(4) Estimate cost of applying consolidated RCM program recommendations; and
(5) Provide any other requirements or identified impediments to the incorporation of RCM principles in Naval Facilities such as organizational changes, revised procurements and/or construction specifications, modifications and/or replacement of existing maintenance management software, logistics, or recommended training. 

The implementation of this study will be included in this contract, and may be identified as an option or phase that can be exercised at the discretion of the government, and will include:
(1) Implementation of selected recommendations from the prioritized list developed in item (3) above.

<SUBJECT>--Technical Assistance for RiverWare source code additions for the Kansas River Systems Operational Model
<DESC>NA The US Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City, MO Engineering and Construction Division requires technical assistance for the RiverWare Software.  Assistance is required for approximately 15 months. IT Services (C++ coding) and Operations Research services a re required for the modification of the “RiverWare” Reservoir System Modeling Software to provide the required simulation capabilities for the Kansas River reservoir system.  NWK acquired the “RiverWare” software through contract DACW41-99-P-0244.  “RiverW are” is proprietary software of CADSWES, which is a non-profit corporation.  The contractor will work with the US Army Corps of Engineers’ designated representative to provide analysis and implementation of Kansas River gated surcharge regulation, analysis  and implementation of Reservoir Lake phase and lake character state variables, analysis and implementation of forecasted incremental flows and inflows, analysis and implementation of forecasted cumulative uncontrolled flows, and analysis and implementatio n of time dependent reservoir system balancing. “RiverWare” is proprietary copyrighted software of CADSWES.  Modifications to “RiverWare” source code can only be made through CADSWES.  Adopting other vender software would require substantial duplication of  effort and cost already invested in “RiverWare” modeling of the Kansas River reservoir system.  Due to the complexity of the Kansas River system, other vender software might also require source code modification to adequately model the river.
