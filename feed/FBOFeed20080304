<SUBJECT>46--Filtration (oil removal) system for water discharge drainage sump pumps
<SOLNBR>08SP101697
<RESPDATE>042208
<ARCHDATE>03042009
<CONTACT>Becky Bailey Contract Specialist 2083785107     bbailey@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>This requirement is a 100% set-aside for small business under NAICS code 333319 where the size standard is 500 employees.  The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement to purchase a filtration system for drainage sump pumps located at the Third Powerplant at Grand Coulee Dam, Washington.  The Government will install the new filtration system.  This acquisition is the supply requirement only.  Background:  The filtration system will be used to remove oil from the water discharge of the Third Powerplant (TPP), Grand Coulee Dam, Washington, drainage sump pumps.  The large drainage sump (at the TPP, Grand Coulee Dam) is equipped with two pumps.  Each pump nominally discharges 3,600 GPM at 100 feet total head.  Each pump has its own (separate) discharge line (that is, not into a common header).  The discharge pipe is 12-inch IPS.  The two pumps operate on a "lead/lag" control scheme, to balance the run time between them.  Under normal conditions, one pump can handle the volume of water coming into the sump.  However, in an emergency, both pumps run to provide additional drainage capacity.  Thus, the required maximum flow capacity of the system is 7,200 GPM.  This facility cannot take either pump out of service for extended periods of time.  The drainage sump currently has an oil skimmer system.  The Government is implementing a positive approach to remove oil and other contaminants from each pump's water discharge.  General System Requirements:  The proposed shall System shall have a flow capacity of 7,200 GPM, to allow both pumps to run in a plant emergency.  During normal conditions, only one of the pumps cycles on and off during the day.  This is the "lead" pump.  The other pump is the "lag" pump.  During normal conditions, the lag pump does not run.  The TPP alternates the lead and lag duties between the two pumps, to balance their running hours.  The filtration system design shall allow maintenance workers to replace the filter media in the lag pump's flow path without taking the lead pump out of service.  This procurement will be conducted as a commercial item, lowest price technically acceptable source selection acquisition under Parts 12 and Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  All responsible small business sources may submit an offer in response to the solicitation (once issued) which shall be considered by Reclamation.  The evaluation factors will be described in the actual solicitation package.  Solicitation No. 08SP101697 for this requirement will be electronically available on or about March 18, 2008, to qualified interested parties at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Subsequent amendments to the solicitation, if any, will be promulgated via the http://www.fedbizopps.gov website.  In order to receive notice of any possible amendment you must be registered at the FBO website for this solicitation. Written and/or telephone requests will not be accepted.  Only vendors registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will be considered for award.  See www.ccr.gov for more information.  Offerors that download this solicitation must monitor the site for amendments.  Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to Becky Bailey at (208)378-5107 or email: bbailey@pn.usbr.gov.  See Numbered Note 1.

NO EXCEPTIONS. FAILURE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A 'NON RESPONSIVE' BID AND REMOVAL FROM AWARD CONSIDERATION<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO requires the renewal of support and maintenance for Remedy software. The annual renewal of BMC Remedy software maintenance for Overseas Systems Support provides an upgrade path from version 6 to the currently available version 7. This upgrade is free to those customers that have purchased the maintenance and is needed by CA to provide a sufficient number of Remedy server licenses for combining the domestic and overseas help desk in the near future. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line. Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for a course entitled ?Pro/Engineer Precision Learning? to be conducted at NASA's Johnson Space Center. The objective of this course is to provide expert insight and mentoring services to Precision Learning Program participants in conjunction with the delivery of Precision Learning classroom workshops. Precision Learning mentoring will help participants apply the theories and ideas obtained in the classroom workshops to actual project work.  Activities include: working with small groups to further expand on lessons taught; working with specific program teams to refine or develop methodologies that would positively impact their respective programs; and identification of opportunities for future Precision Learning activities.   The vendor shall conduct three months (April-June 2008) of assessments, onsite training, and weekly one-on-one mentoring meetings to develop curriculum that specifically addresses the proficiencies and skills gaps of the workshop participants.  The vendor will provide a comprehensive customized learning program consisting of three phases: planning, learning and validation. The planning phase shall identify user roles, build role-based curriculum paths and knowledge assessments, as well as execution of baseline knowledge assessments to enable customization of the curriculum.  The learning phase shall consist of instructor-led workshops and mentoring to include eight 4-hour workshops culminating in Pro/Engineer training licenses.  The final phase shall provide individual follow-up assessments as well as compilation of results to be presented back to the Center. NASA/NSSC intends to purchase the training course from Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC), 140 Kendrick St, Needham, MA 02494-2714.  Pursuant to FAR 13.106, the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1) Precision Learning Workshops are offered exclusively by PTC; 2) PTC training specialists use a concrete learning methodology to determine individual user needs and match them to PTC software-training programs; and 3) PTC training specialists have the necessary experience and capability to design individual learning plans that include: knowledge assessments, curriculum plans based on assessment results, and training schedules. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Megan Willis at Megan.M.Willis@nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 19, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis to conduct the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) for the 2010 and 2011 survey years. The purpose of the NSDUH is to provide current data on substance use and mental health prevalence for the U.S. population (aged 12 and older), each state and the District of Columbia, and to issue reports on survey results. The survey sample will support annual estimates of prevalence for the nation, the 50 states, and the District of Columbia. The contractor will be required to: (1) provide interviewers and interviewer supervisory staff to screen approximately 182,500 dwelling units and conduct 67,500 interviews per survey year, using computer-assisted interviewing technology; (2) develop training procedures/materials and conduct training classes in order to maintain a qualified field staff and satisfy survey fieldwork goals; (3) use statistical expertise to (a) employ a state-based sample design, with an independent, multi-stage area sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and (b) employ small area estimation techniques in order to develop model-based estimates; (4) perform technical writing, analysis, and methodological studies to complete and support the contract tasking; and (5) conduct a Mental Health Surveillance Study (MHSS) and generate a mental health module for NSDUH that can provide accurate estimates of the prevalence of serious mental illness (SMI) among adults (aged 18 or older) at national and state levels. Data collected from an annual follow-up sample of 500 NSDUH respondents will be used to calibrate the NSDUH mental health screening scales, if necessary. The estimated period of performance is 56.5 months. The solicitation may be obtained by either of two ways: by mail, or electronically by downloading a file from FedBizOpps or the SAMHSA Web Site at http://www.samhsa.gov/contracts/contracts.html. Once downloaded, you should determine if you have a continuing interest in the RFP.

<DESC>4 March 2008 Urgent Information concerning the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program  (ATEP) follows:   Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) is not recognizing ATEP's solicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2560. Consequently, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS  post to ATEP did not post on FBO under said solicitation number. After numerous  attempts by PIXS and FBO administrators to resolve the issue, both concluded the  only solution is to reissue ATEP information under a new solicitation number. Therefore to ensure you receive any and all updates to the ATEP, you must  register/ re-register under the new solicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2599. The  name of the program has not changed, it is still the Advanced Technical Exploitation  Program (ATEP). Additionally, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS posting issuing a new sources sought  synopsis is also attached.   That posting issued a suspense date of 1500 local, 14 Mar  08 for submittal of capability statements.  Due to the posting difficulties, a  new suspense date of 1500 local, 18 Mar 08 is established. There are no  other changes to the requirements for submittals.

In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.   Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.

Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer whose name appears herein.  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.

<DESC>Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the provision of corporate-wide implant and e-travel services to NATO Headquarters (NATO HQ) and Allied Command Operations (ACO). 

SHAPE is serving as the contracting agency for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. The estimated total cumulative value of this project is Euro 40 million ($60.9 million).
SHAPE intends to award the contract to the lowest compliant bidder.

The title of the IFIB (Invitation for International Bidding) is NATO HQ/ACO Travel Services Contract. The reference number for this project is IFIB-ACO-SH-08-28. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference number.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The travel services will embrace best commercial practices through the effective use of the internet. E-travel services will be commercially hosted, guaranteeing real time travel information at the lowest possible and practicable cost. Additional back-up services will be provided by a contractor-operated plant (if required).  

The contract will initially include NATO HQ, SHAPE, JFC HQ Brunssum, and JFC HQ Naples. It is contemplated during the term of the contract to extend the subject services to other commands. This will be done through bilateral contract modifications that will allow all commands to benefit from the full buying power of NATO and to streamline and consolidate travel operations.

The IFIB package will contain material at the level of NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

Eligible firms are those that have performed at least three (3) contracts within the last five (5) tears substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation. 

SHAPE will directly e-mail the IFIB to those firms on its bidders list. SHAPE will also post the tender documents on the following website:

http://www.nato.int/shape/community/budfin/ifib/index.htm

As provided for under MBC rules, nominations to the bidders list will continue to be accepted by the contracting agency after the IFIB is issued and until the bid closing date.

BIDDING PROCEDURE

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the contracting agency for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the NATO contracting agency. The NATO contracting agency will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Deadline for requesting Declaration of Eligibility: 25 March

2. Planned IFIB release date: April 2008 

3. Planned bid closing date: June 2008

4. Period of performance: One base year (2009) plus four one-year options

The Contractor shall also deliver a plan for the transition from the legacy system to the new COTS system which meets CRS integration requirements and which demonstrates compatibility with the CRS IT infrastructure.//Offerors will be asked to provide a written proposal and an oral presentation including a demonstration of the user interface and the manner in which the COTS product will handle various scenarios, searches, and reports.

This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). TECHNICAL POC: Mr. Jerry Rubinsky (301) 342-9355 

I. INTRODUCTION. The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR) and the Structures and Materials Engineering Divisions under the Air Vehicle Department (AIR-4.3) are soliciting proposals for research and development (R&D) concepts in the area of structures and materials to support current and future Naval Aviation needs. Concepts proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology. 

II. BACKGROUND. The missions of the Structures and Materials Engineering Divisions of the NAVAIR Air Vehicle Department are to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop, evaluate, and transition those technologies into NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS to impart new military capabilities. To this end, NAVAIR is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. Proposals may be either basic or applied research. Proposals that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered. Multiple awards are anticipated. The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds. While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposer include a Phase I of no more than 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort. No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST. New Structures and Materials, Structural and Material Concepts, Structural Analysis, Modeling and Simulation, and Materials Processing applied to metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: development and application of new and improved structural concepts, analytical modeling and simulation, life tracking, resins, structural reinforcing fibers, core and foam materials, adhesives, and sealants/coatings for naval aviation applications; new and/or lower cost manufacturing processes for structural components (including tooling); new and novel materials, processes and design methods for structural repair; process modeling; engineered materials for low-observable applications; high temperature resins/adhesives; structural and non-structural adhesives, Applique and paint replacement film materials, environmentally compliant surface preparations for bonding, non-chromated and organic corrosion inhibitors for sealants and/or adhesives, novel approaches to toughened resins for prepregs and adhesives; composite property/life prediction and related technologies; fracture phenomena of polymers & composites; galvanic corrosion ; Optical materials and coatings for aircraft transparencies and their repair; and structural and multifunctional (structure + function) materials. Ideas outside of the advertised focused areas will be considered in scope provided they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the interest of the office. IV. 

CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE. NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Grants, Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions). Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/grants.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research. Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government. NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to issue a sole source Request for Proposals (RFP) to Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation (BATC) for continued performance under the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Instrument Servicing (HIS) contract.  This continued performance is required to ensure uninterrupted support to cover existing and potential repairs to HST science instruments through Servicing Mission 4 (SM4). The HIS contract was awarded in 1998 as an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to maximize long-term HST science return through repair and re-use of previously developed hardware and software and common support functions. The HIS contract allows the Government to leverage this unique opportunity by achieving efficient, optimized use and allocation of common resources.  Due to anomalies experienced with current on-orbit instruments, the manifest for SM4 was previously modified to include additional instrument repair efforts. An increase to the maximum value of this IDIQ contract is necessary to allow completion of the design and development effort required for SM4. In order to meet the HST SM4 schedule, and provide the specialized expertise to implement instrument repair solutions, a sole source procurement from BATC is required. No other companies have the knowledge and understanding of the unique HST instruments who can provide the flight hardware in time to support the August 2008 launch date. BATC has designed, built, assembled, integrated and tested three generations of flight instruments for HST. There are currently four instruments on HST built by BATC, including the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).  The continued performance under this contract will allow Ball to continue support for on-orbit anomaly investigation as well as hardware, software, and integration activities for the ACS and STIS repairs that are planned for SM4. BATC will continue support of overall HST on-orbit instrument servicing and anomaly resolution; participate as a member of the Independent Team to review the current HST instrument power supply designs; provide a new Low Voltage Power Supply (LVPS), CCD Electronics Boxes (CEB), and power harness for ACS repair; provide support for designing the interfaces to the ACS power connector; complete development of the STIS repair; provide support for the development and fabrication of the ACS-Repair tools; and  provide support for testing and evaluating system performance for Engineering and Flight Model builds of the instrument repair solutions. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note ?B?. See Notes 22 and 26. Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( C ) (1)?Only One Responsible Source. However, organizations that believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules, may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00PM EST on March 19, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), NIAID, NIH, supports research to identify therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and co-infections with pportunistic pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  DAIDS-sponsored researchers are actively engaged in investigating the basic biology of the targeted pathogens, identifying novel therapeutic approaches to treat diseases caused by these infectious agents, and testing therapeutic agents in vitro and in animal models.  Prior to evaluation in clinical trials, most experimental agents require chemical resynthesis, pharmaceutical analysis, and dosage formulation to ensure products are of sufficient quantity and quality to permit proper testing in humans.  DAIDS currently uses contracts to fulfill its needs for these services.  This solicitation will support the DAIDS drug development effort by accomplishing the synthesis of therapeutic agents in small and large scale amounts, some according to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This solicitation provides for the recompetition of a contract (N01-AI-05402) that was awarded to Starks Associates, Inc. for synthesis of potential therapeutic agents for treatment of infectious diseases.  Over 250 different compounds of interest to DAIDS have been synthesized to date.  Compounds assigned for synthesis include heterocycles (typically containing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur), carbocycles, carbohydrates, nucleosides and peptides.  The majority of synthesized compounds have been used by DAIDS-supported contracts for enzymatic, in vitro, and in vivo studies.  Small quantities of metabolites have been synthesized for use in mechanism of action and metabolism studies and larger, bulk quantities of compounds have been synthesized for animal studies and clinical trials.  The scope of this effort is small scale synthesis of compounds in quantities required for testing in either in vitro screens or animals, and large scale synthesis of compounds for early Phase I clinical studies.  Some compounds will require synthesis in compliance with cGMP regulations.  This contract will provide resources for the synthesis of promising compounds for the treatment of HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis and other infectious diseases of relevance to the research agenda of NIAID.  The major tasks to be carried out are as follows:  1) Initial transition; 2) Synthesize compounds (small scale); 3) Synthesize compounds (large scale); 4) Acquire compounds for efficacy testing; 5) Ship compounds to NIAID; 6) Provide facilities, equipment, and other resources; 7) Information Security; and 8) Final transition.  This is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of seven (7) years beginning on or about February 16, 2008.  It is estimated that six (6) full time equivalents (FTE) will be required on a yearly basis.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. This RFP will be available electronically on/about May 23, 2007, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and through the FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>Communications technology that can provide seamless, robust, connectivity is at the foundation of the Sea Power 21 and FORCEnet Vision ?... to have the right information, at the right place, at the right time ...?  The performance of Command and Control (C2) systems and decision making at all levels of command depend critically on reliable, interoperable, survivable, secure and timely communications and networking, and the availability of high capacity multimedia (voice, data, imagery) communication networks is fundamental to nearly all Department of Navy missions.  The current evolution of naval warfighting from a platform-centric to a network-centric paradigm depends on successfully meeting the implied need for significantly enhanced communications and networking capabilities, extending both to fixed shore facilities and to highly mobile air, surface, land and subsurface platforms, including the so-called ?disadvantaged user?, e.g., small-deck combatants, submarines, unmanned air vehicles (UAVs),  dispersed ground units in urban and radio frequency (RF) challenged environments.  The goal of the Communications and Networking Program within the Office of Naval Research (ONR 312) is to support the FORCEnet vision by developing measurable advances in technology that can directly enable and enhance end-to-end connectivity for mission-critical information exchange among such widely dispersed naval, joint and coalition forces.

<DESC>This program addresses current shortfalls in automated mechanisms for information integration resulting from limitations in technology and uncertainty/imprecision of data and information. The Program seeks to develop hardware and software technologies that (1) provide automated approaches for real-time image processing and analysis; (2) identify and integrate informational content from multiple information sources; (3) offer persistent surveillance of the network and its information space; and (4) provide automatic correlation, fusion, and insight to support decision making with large data sets. This year, a particular emphasis will be placed on the Automated Image Understanding thrust and the Automated SIGINT (Signal Intelligence) Understanding sub-area.

The NIAID is currently supporting approximately 400 trials related to HIV and AIDS in various stages.  These trials range from 10 to 6000 participants and are conducted in 46 countries.  Approximately 22 of the 46 countries are resource limited.  The Contractor may be asked to provide assistance, and assessment, or consultation related to any of the NIAID HIV AIDS funded clinical studies and be aware that NIAID sponsors multiple large, international trials at the same time.

The resultant contract is intended to augment the capacity of services provided by existing research support contracts to provide flexibility and scalability.  Performance will involve daily interaction between the Contractor and NIAID staff for activities that require continuity, a high degree of collaborative problem solving, and time sensitive decision making. Contractor expertise and support shall be provided in the following major areas:  Clinical Research Support, Program Research and Operations Support, Communications Support, Conflict of Interest Mitigation, Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality, and Project Management.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Rasheda Sherron, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-0830
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a sole source, fixed rate purchase order to F & J Specialty Products, in conjunction with the office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Radiation and Indoor Environments National Laboratory (ORIA/R&IE) in collaboration with the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Washington D.C., and Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory (ORIA/NAREL). EPA is continuing its efforts to provide defensible radiological analytical values to the public and other  governmental Agencies.  R&IE supports Superfund projects in cleanup, removal, remediation and radiological emergencies.  EPA under the National Response Plan (NRP) and other federally mandated regulations would be tasked as the Coordination Agency (CA) for specific radiological responses.  These  tasks include but are not limited to supplying support equipment, personnel, and radiation detection equipment to EPA Regional personnel and Incident Command Leadership under the incident Command System (ICS) across North America including Alaska.  In providing this support, both R&IE and NAREL are  tasked with maintaining, repairing, troubleshooting, deploying and operation of the RadNet-DNRMS.  Based on current configuration for engineered hardware and software, F& J Specialty is the only company that EPA can obtain the various services for the High Volume Air Sampler DH-804V.2 and Low  Volume Air Sampler DL-28B, for the RadNet-DNRMS units.  F&J Specialty is the only company that manufactures and can supply EPA with Hardware and Software support.  This means no other manufacturer has the accessibility to proprietary engineered hardware (i.e., parts and components) or proprietary  software designs used on the RadNet-DNRMS units. The contractor shall provide service support on up to 10 deployable monitors to meet EPA objectives for the tasks described for performance period for one year.  F& J can further define the individual component to be repaired or replaced.  EPA is not  expecting the Contractor to repair or replace the Genitron GammaTRACER, GPS or Weather Station.  In addition, EPA is requesting a basic software flat rate contract with possible tier approach to programming.  The basic software rate should include any upgrades within the Period of Performance  including phone support.  As part of the contract costs, EPA would expect that at a minimum the High Volume Air Samplers and standard components, Low Volume and standard components, Data Logger and standard components, to be repaired or replaced.  Currently EPA has RadNet Deployable National  Radiological Monitoring Stations (DNRMS) constructed to meet Homeland Security defense capabilities for radiological emergency response requirements.  The RadNet-DNRMS units are housed in Las Vegas, Nevada, also at the EPA R&IE facility and the Montgomery, Alabama, EPA facility.   EPA obtains  contract support to service a percentage of the RadNet-DNRMS monitors.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement  will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Rasheda Sherron via email at  sherron.rasheda@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/DO requires the renewal of support and maintenance for Remedy software. The annual renewal of BMC Remedy software maintenance for Overseas Systems Support provides an upgrade path from version 6 to the currently available version 7. This upgrade is free to those customers that have purchased the maintenance and is needed by CA to provide a sufficient number of Remedy server licenses for combining the domestic and overseas help desk in the near future. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line. Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.<BR><BR>Support Contract Number: 9809<BR><BR>

<DESC>Amendment to Solicitation No. AG-91S8-S-08-0001.

The purpose of this amendment is to provide a response to solicitation questions.  Following are seven questions and the Government response to solicitation questions:  


QUESTION ONE:  Pg 6, Section B, 1st Paragraph and question one of lst round of questions. Those outfits bidding on all 3 years of Bid Item #1, will they be downgraded for not having a (CA) RPF on Staff?

Response:  No.  As shown on page 6, Section B - Schedule Supplies/Services:  Item 1 requires a Crew Leader and Data Collector.  This schedule contains three separate items.  Firms may submit a quote on any item or all items.  However, within each item, firms must submit a quote/hourly rate for all labor categories, for both on site and off site services, and for all three years (the base year, and each of the two option years).  Each item will be evaluated separately and may be awarded separately.  


QUESTION TWO:  For bid item 1. Of the approximate 1,000-1,200 Plots over the next 3 years:
a)	What % of the plots will be re-measures and what % will be initial installs?
b)	 For those re-measure plots, will all plots have field GPS Coor, or will a % only have maps and approx. BPS coor. (pre 1998? Installs)?
c)	What % of these plots will be in Woodlands, Chaparral & Shrub Veg Types/ Ecosystems? Save to assume these plots mainly on SoCal NF?s?


Response:  National Forest (NF) plots are primarily remeasure.  Some non-NF plots may be new installations. Special study projects on NF may also require new installations. 

Most of the remeasure plots have previous GPS coordinates.  There may be +/- 2% that do not have GPS coordinates. 

Over 90% of the plots are forested, including woodlands, for the Pilot Project (applicable to Item No. 1) on Southern California National Forests and other ownerships shown in the Solicitation.

Over the next 3 years, work is planned for the Southern Sierra as well as Southern California National Forests.  Plot installations will be a mixture of Forested, Woodlands, Hard Chaparral, Soft Shrub and Herbaceous Vegetation Types.  Sample percentages by vegetation type for future project work are not available at this time. 

QUESTION THREE:  Are we to assume that there will or could be more than 1 award for each of the Bid Items?

Response:  Yes.


QUESTION FOUR:  Is there any estimate of yearly total $ orders for Bid item 2?

Response:  No.  The future contracts will be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contracts.  Task Orders will be awarded on an as needed basis, and will depend on the amount of work needed, and amount of budget available.


QUESTION FIVE:  For Stand exams, why would a RPF be required? I could understand under harvesting situations but otherwise it seems like a little overkill by adding an average of $10-$15/hour for no real gain. 

Response:  This is a requirement of our existing Memorandum of Understanding with the State of California.   Additional, the Forest Service has the option to set standards required to meet current and future needs.


QUESTION SIX:  What is the process for dealing with a case where either a plot is on the map and there is no data in the plot summary sheet, or there is data in the summary sheet but the plot is not mapped?

Response:  The plot will be re-installed according to the latest field manual standards, which will include plot mapping as part of remeasurement, regardless of what information is provided from a previous measurement.  


QUESTION SEVEN:  What is the process for getting access to plots on Military installations ? will we need to get a full clearance with paperwork submitted to the military branch or facility significantly in advance of work proceeding?

Response:  Inventory plots to be installed outside of NF ownership, are being done cooperatively with Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNW), and any permissions required will be coordinated in advance by PNW. 

End of Amendment and Government Response to Questions.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Q: Please consider adding FAA certification as an alternate approval requirement other than the OEM or DOD. There is a wide variety of manufactures to address along with component diversity issues. The small business being the target vendor would not posses such certifications. You will notice Solicitation HSSCG38-08-R-H00002 was amended to include FAA certification for this reason.

A: Due to the critical nature of these components, the requirement for OEM or DOD certification for the instruments in this solicitation remains in effect.

Questions regarding Addenda M: Source Selection Procedures & Criteria

Q: Concerning the Source Selection Procedure under minimum supporting documentation on page 32:

1) Copy of current DLSC registration. What is DLSC?
   A: See paragraph H.4 of the solicitation.

2) Copy that depicts evidence of possession of specific technical documents. Are you requesting the cover page from each manual?
   A: The cover page of applicable manuals is acceptable.

3) Copy of QC Manual.  OK

<DESC>The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is the public policy research arm of the United States Congress.  CRS serves the Congress throughout the legislative process by providing comprehensive and reliable legislative research, analysis, and information services that are timely, objective, non-partisan, and confidential, thereby contributing to an informed national legislature.//CRS currently uses a legacy system, the Inquiry Status and Information System (ISIS), which was developed in-house to manage requests for analysis and information from congressional clients.  Assistance is required to provide a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) replacement for that system which not only allows CRS to record, track, and generate reports about requests received, pending, and completed, but also facilitates research management and collaboration and provides client relationship management capabilities.   The Contractor shall provide software, implementation, and training for this COTS system, which will be used by approximately 500 staff members in the CRS research community.  The Contractor shall also deliver a plan for the transition from the legacy system to the new COTS system which meets CRS integration requirements and which demonstrates compatibility with the CRS IT infrastructure.//Offerors will be asked to provide a written proposal and an oral presentation including a demonstration of the user interface and the manner in which the COTS product will handle various scenarios, searches, and reports. Period of performance. This period of performance shall be twelve months from date of award.  The contractor shall deliver the first release of the new system with all mandatory and agreed-upon critical functionality within three months of contract award. It is anticipated that the solicitation/RFP will be released on or about Friday, March 14, 2008.//Mod 0001: A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for Thursday, March 20, 2008. All interested attendees (limited to 3 people per company) should register names via email to jwalker@loc.gov on 3/12/2008.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION CHANGES THE DUE DATE FOR SUBMITTAL OF PROPOSALS TO JULY 30, 2007.

The Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), NIAID, NIH, supports research to identify therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and co-infections with pportunistic pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  DAIDS-sponsored researchers are actively engaged in investigating the basic biology of the targeted pathogens, identifying novel therapeutic approaches to treat diseases caused by these infectious agents, and testing therapeutic agents in vitro and in animal models.  Prior to evaluation in clinical trials, most experimental agents require chemical resynthesis, pharmaceutical analysis, and dosage formulation to ensure products are of sufficient quantity and quality to permit proper testing in humans.  DAIDS currently uses contracts to fulfill its needs for these services.  This solicitation will support the DAIDS drug development effort by accomplishing the synthesis of therapeutic agents in small and large scale amounts, some according to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This solicitation provides for the recompetition of a contract (N01-AI-05402) that was awarded to Starks Associates, Inc. for synthesis of potential therapeutic agents for treatment of infectious diseases.  Over 250 different compounds of interest to DAIDS have been synthesized to date.  Compounds assigned for synthesis include heterocycles (typically containing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur), carbocycles, carbohydrates, nucleosides and peptides.  The majority of synthesized compounds have been used by DAIDS-supported contracts for enzymatic, in vitro, and in vivo studies.  Small quantities of metabolites have been synthesized for use in mechanism of action and metabolism studies and larger, bulk quantities of compounds have been synthesized for animal studies and clinical trials.  The scope of this effort is small scale synthesis of compounds in quantities required for testing in either in vitro screens or animals, and large scale synthesis of compounds for early Phase I clinical studies.  Some compounds will require synthesis in compliance with cGMP regulations.  This contract will provide resources for the synthesis of promising compounds for the treatment of HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis and other infectious diseases of relevance to the research agenda of NIAID.  The major tasks to be carried out are as follows:  1) Initial transition; 2) Synthesize compounds (small scale); 3) Synthesize compounds (large scale); 4) Acquire compounds for efficacy testing; 5) Ship compounds to NIAID; 6) Provide facilities, equipment, and other resources; 7) Information Security; and 8) Final transition.  This is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of seven (7) years beginning on or about February 16, 2008.  It is estimated that six (6) full time equivalents (FTE) will be required on a yearly basis.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. This RFP will be available electronically on/about May 23, 2007, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and through the FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE REPLACES AND SUPERSEDES Sources Sought Notice Reference-Number-FA8217-08-R-TBD3 posted on 26 Feb 08.   

This Sources Sought Synopsis constitutes a Request for Information to assist the Air Force in conducting Market Research.  This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the Air Force potential requirements for the development, test, and delivery of one pre-production Remote Generator Controller (RGC), and the possibility of an Option for up to 3 EA follow-on production units.    The RGC must interface with both the Mobile Electric Power (MEP) MEP-806B (GENSET) and the Joint Treat Emitter (JTE) Threat Emitter Unit (TEU) to control the generator operations.  This control includes but is not limited to start, monitor, adjust report status messages to the exact format that the JTE is expecting, and shut down of the GENSET. This development phase is expected to take approximately 6-10 months.

The RGC must be a kit that can be installed in the field by Military Power Production technicians by installing the kit on existing GENSET.  The environmental requirements for the RGC must meet or exceed those of the GENSET.   The government does not have a competitive bid package for the digital interface to the GENSET.  Interested parties should clearly identify with supporting rationale if they have the ability to meet the requirements without this competitive bid package from the Government.  

As part of the associated data package (drawings, data and software necessary for the maintenance and/or competitively contracted maintenance) the Air Force desires to receive no less than "government purpose rights."  If a responding company is not able to meet this requirement, a detailed of list of rights should be included in the response.

All pricing arrangements ae being considered.  However, a rsponding company must provide rationale if they believe that a firm-fixed-price pricing arrangement is not appropriate for the pre-production unit price and/or the production unit price. 

Each interested entity that has the capability to meet the requirements identified above hereby has the opportunity to provide supporting rationale that they can meet the identified requirements; each response may also include any other additional information that is requested within the Sources Sought Synopsis.  The Government also requests that each interested entity also provide a ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude) price for the development/pre-production unit and a ROM price for three follow-on production units; note that delivery of these ROMs is not required.  Note that any response with price data provided to this Sources Sought will not be used to make an award decision, or to obligate the Government in any way. 

Please respond to:  Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, OO-ALC/84 CBSG/PKR; Attn: James G. Thiros; 6039 Wardleigh Road, Bldg. 1206; Hill AFB; UT 84056-5838 (or e-mail: James.Thiros@hill.af.mil), fax (801) 586-3366.

Responses are due no later than 1600 (4:00 PM) MST on 12 March 2008.  No phone responses will be accepted.  

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this sources sought synopsis/Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.  Copies of the submitted information will be reviewed and may be used to develop a Request for Proposal.

<CONTACT>Wilma Estrada, 757-878-5003
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to BAA W911W6-08-R-0006 is to publish all questions received and responses provided to date. QUESTION 1: One of the solicitation topics highlighted in the description discussed the development of corrosion monitors. Is t here any additional technical information on the type of corrosion monitors desired and/or the materials of interest? Is there any additional information to help understand the areas of corrosion that the solicitation is trying to focus on? RESPONSE 1: No additional information can be provided beyond the announcement and the ASSP document referenced therein. As stated in the announcement, AATD is interested in efforts to mature and evaluate corrosion sensors for rotorcraft structures. Note that the announce ment expresses no preference in sensing mechanism or sensor type as long as it is effective. In accordance with the announcement, impact to the structure and aircraft, such as size, weight, and wiring needs, will be considered in evaluating the proposed co ncepts. Structural materials of interest are those found in current rotorcraft concepts. Structural materials of interest are those found in current rotorcraft structures, as defined in the referenced ASSP 2005-Joint Services VTOL Rotorcraft. QUESTION 2: I s Applied Research and Development in Durability Damage Tolerance (D&DT) and Rotorcraft Airframe Technology (RAT) a new opportunity or is there an incumbent? If there is an incumbent on this opportunity, can you provide the following information-award date , contract number, contractor name, award amount? RESPONSE 2: Even though work has been previously done in similar or supporting areas, RAT & D&DT are new opportunities. QUESTION 3: Is there an anticipated time frame for the BAA release? RESPONSE 3: The an nouncement, as published in FedBizOpps dated February 11, 2008, constitutes the only solicitation. QUESTION 4: Is this the final solicitation for this effort? The listing on FedBizOpps indicates that this is a presolicitation. RESPONSE 4: Per the announcem ent, no further solicitation will be issued. The announcement contains all information needed to respond. QUESTION 5: Please authorize me to access the links provided in your AATD BAA for W911W6-08-R-0006. RESPONSE 5: Here are the links associated with BAA  W911W6-08-R-0006. The links appear to be working. http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/docs/IAC_CP.ppt<BR>http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/docs/ASSP_Structures_TOs.ppt<BR>http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/docs/OSST.ppt<BR>QUESTION 6: In reference to the subject s olicitation, when an OTHER TRANSACTION proposal/contract is anticipated the standard deliverables are normally a quarterly status/financial report and a final report. Will this hold true for this solicitation and the data deliverables called out on page 3 of 5 are solely for CPFF proposals/contracts? RESPONSE 6: Based on QUESTION 6, the following section of the BAA is revised as follows: DATA DELIVERABLES: The following data deliverables are desired: Management Plan, Bi-Monthly Cost and Performance Progress  Reports, Final Report, Final Briefing at Ft. Eustis, and Briefing Charts. The following are anticipated only if applicable: Test Plans, Test Reports, Software Development Plan, and Software Requirements Specification. Specific data deliverables will be ne gotiated between the parties and will depend upon instrument to be awarded and applicability. Contractor format will be acceptable. QUESTION 7: The BAA Solicitation W911W6-08-R-0006 on RAT refers to several topic areas addressing Structures Technology Obje ctives and a link to a Powerpoint presentation, http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/docs/ASSP_Structures_TOs.ppt.  <BR>Slide 9 in the presentation lists numerous attributes for the Structures Technology Baseline. May I get clarification on what each of these a ttributes mean? RESPONSE 7: The Aviation S&T Strategic Plan (ASSP), including the Structures Tech Area Technology Objectives covered in detail in the subject ch arts, was developed several years ago through a collaborative process involving the Government (joint DoD and NASA) and Industry. It would therefore not be appropriate for us to potentially deviate from how the community understands these attributes by pro viding interpretation beyond what is contained in the collaborative ASSP charts. QUESTION 8: The subject BAA asks for separate proposals for Topics 1 and 2 but also states that multiple proposals are acceptable. Does this mean a contractor can submit multi ple proposals under one topic, e.g., multiple proposals under Topic 2? RESPONSE 8: The synopsis states that multiple proposals are acceptable, and contains no prohibition against multiple proposals being submitted under the same topic. Therefore, yes, an O fferor may submit more than one proposal under one topic. QUESTION 9: For Topic 1, is the Army targeting both rotating and non-rotating structures for the D&DT methodology?  Do they anticipate an approach that is applicable to both? RESPONSE 9: The Aviatio n S&T Strategic Plan (ASSP) charts (URL provided in the synopsis) refer to many examples of structures applicable to this BAA, and those examples include both rotating and non-rotating structures. See, for example, charts 8-9 and 11-16. The breadth of appl icability of any proposed methodology is left to the Offeror to describe and substantiate. QUESTION 10: Please clarify the following abbreviations: FP comp skins, HSM frames/subfloor, 42 fps survivable, 23 HEI tolerance. RESPONSE 10: FP comp skins refer to  Fiber Placement Composite Skins, which is an automated composites processing technique, HSM frames/subfloor refer to High Speed Machined frames/subfloor structure, 42 fps survivable refers to an aircraft enabling occupant survival in a 42 ft per sec verti cal impact, 23 HEI tolerance refers to typical ballistic threats up to USSR 23mm HEI anti-aircraft projectiles. QUESTION 11: What does the question mark after 5000 represent in the following statement in the solicitation: Specifically, high-strain (approx.  5000 ?i n/in) capable structural concepts are desired to save weight in primary structure through maintaining structural integrity at strain levels beyond current practice? RESPONSE 11: The question mark was supposed to be the Greek lower-case letter mu, which is the SI prefix micro-, which represents one millionth. Thus high-strain (approx. 5000 ?in/in) in the synopsis is revised to read high-strain (approx. 5000 microin/in). Also, strain rate expressed in in/sec is better expressed in in/in/sec. Thus hig h strain-rates (approx. 1000 in/sec) is revised in the synopsis to read high strain-rates (1,000 in/in/sec or higher).

<DESC>The following is a Request For Information (RFI). This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). The RFI will be used for the purpose of exchanging information to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and enhancing the Government's ability to obtain quality supplies and services at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award. The Government believes industry feedback is important and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in increased competition, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential contractual problem areas associated with the draft requirement. The United States Marine Corps seeks to improve the ability to cool the crew compartment of the M1A!  1 Main Battle Tank.  Currently, there is no dedicated cooling system in the M1A1 tank.  Crewmembers have no way to reduce the extreme temperatures experienced while supporting the Global War on Terror, especially in the summer months.  A climate control system or microclimatic cooling system should reduce heat stress and fatigue on the crewmembers to increase their alertness.   The USMC seeks information from any vendor that has the capability of reducing the heat stress of the M1A1 crewmembers.  Proposed systems shall meet all threshold system characteristics.  While not required, the ability to meet the objective system characteristics is highly desirable. Threshold system characteristics: 1.Can be operated both when the engine is and is not running. 2.Does not impact the Nuclear, Biological, or Chemical Protection system of the tank.3.Does not introduce hazardous or volatile substances into the crew compartment of the tank.4.Does not have an impact on the accomplishment of crew tasks and crew egress. 5.Does not require welding or drilling on the tank.Objective system characteristics: 1.Power consumption of no more than 36 amps to allow the Auxiliary Power Unit to power the system when the engine is not running. 2.	If an individual cooling system, the ability to provide 200 Watts of cooling per individual at 125 ?F and 14% humidity. 3.Utilize a Non-Developmental or Off the Shelf System already in use by other tracked vehicles. 4.Be able to be installed in a field environment, with no requirement for special tools. 5.Shall be capable of maintaining a cool environment while tanks operate with turret hatches in the open position. All contractors who provide goods/services to the DOD must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR). Any forthcoming soliciatation will require online certifications and representations (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. Failure to comply with ORCA registration may make the offeror ineligible for award. Questions concerning this RFI shall be submitted to michael.klaniecki@usmc.mil, with a subject line :M1A1 Crew Cooling Comp!  artment System Questions: not later than 1100, 04 April 2008. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by submitting a white paper, technical data for the item, past performance, and their Rough order of Magnatude (ROM) for the effort, no later than 1100, 04 April 2008. Responses to this RFI shall be submitted by email to michael.klaniecki@usmc.mil, with a subject Line :M1A1 Crew Cooling Compartment System Response: THE SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERENMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO ENTITLEMENT TO PAYMENT OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT CHARGES BY THE GOVERNMENT WILL ARISE AS A RESULT OF SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI AND GOVERNMENT USE OF SUCH INFORMATION.

<DESC>Indian Country Corrections Feasibility Study Statement of Work  Indian Country Corrections Feasibility Study Thirty calendar days after a contract is awarded, the contractor shall present to the Assistant Secretary ? Indian Affairs, Office of Indian Energy and Economic Development, a brief, preliminary study examining the feasibility of developing and operating regional, for-profit, private correction facilities on American Indian trust land.  This study is intended to be a brief, but informative, review of private correction facilities and their potential economic viability for Indian reservations in the Western United States.  The report should provide enough definitive information to allow a decision to be made to either continue evaluating the project or reject it as a viable option.  Basic information about the current location and status of existing facilities, as well as current inmate populations will be made available from the Office of Indian Energy and Economic Development. Assumptions:   ?	The penal facilities shall be constructed on American Indian land for which the federal government acts as trustee. ?	They shall be constructed and operated by private prison corporations, as lessees on Indian trust land, or by federally-recognized Indian tribes and their subcontractors on Indian trust land. ?	They shall be regional in nature. ?	They shall meet design and construction procedure standards established by the Federal Bureau of Prisons Design and Construction Branch.   ?	They shall be safe, humane, and appropriately secure, and shall meet operating standards established by the American Correctional Association. ?	They shall operate profitably, returning to investors within a reasonable time their initial capital and construction costs. ?	Because the facilities shall be constructed on federal trust land, they shall meet the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and all other relevant federal laws, including those relating to accessibility. ?	The facilities shall house federal, state, and/or tribal prisoners, including prisoners from outside the state in which the facilities are located. The study shall examine the known demographics of inmate populations, and identify regions where, there is a critical lack of prison beds, including those for high security and pre-trial confinement. The study shall correlate its findings concerning regional demand for prison beds to locations on Indian trust land where private, regional prisons could be developed and operated profitably to meet that demand. You may submit your interest via fax to Meridith Potts at 703-390-6562.  Please include your POC information and fax number with your request

<CONTACT>Jacob M. Punzalan, Contract Specialist 671-339-5185 jacob.punzalan@navfacmar.navy.mil Norma A. Borja, Contracting Officer 671-339-3901 norma.borja@navfacmar.navy.mil
<DESC>Sources Sought /Request For Information This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  The intent of this synopsis is to identify potential qualified firms capable of providing temporary worker housing described herein.  Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will assist the Government in making the appropriate acquisition decision for the planned procurement.  This is not an announcement of availability of a solicitation. The scope of work for Worker Housing would be to provide berthing, messing, security, access to medical/dental care, transportation (which may include parking facilities) and MWR-type facilities for an off-island workforce dedicated to building Marine and DoD facilities for the Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI) at various locations on the island of Guam.  The number of workers would vary according to the building schedule, from about 1,000 - 2,000 up to a peak of about 15,000.  It is the desire of the DoD that the Worker Housing would be scalable to accommodate the varying number of workers.   The intent of this RFI is to identify potential sources and to obtain information in regard to soliciting proposals for the Worker Housing.  Some of the DoD sites being considered are South Andersen, South Finegayan, and Navy Barrigada.   The DoD is currently interested in identifying risks and advantages associated with various options for the procurement of housing services and/or facilities. Some of the acquisition strategies being considered include: 1) contractor build, operate, maintain, and remove the temporary housing;   2) government lease of modular facilities, contractor operate and maintain housing;  3)  DPRI construction contractors supply housing for their workforce;  4) contractor build, operate and maintain, and remove housing for all workers, via contract agreements with DPRI and other contractors paying for use of the worker housing; 5)  Enhanced Use Lease (in whole or in part) where government provides a ground lease and a contractor (or contractors) build housing and lease to contractors and receive a  return on investment for building, operating and maintaining and removing the Worker Housing, or constructing other facilities through use of government land over a long term lease; 6) Gov!  ernment of Guam sponsor worker housing development on non-DoD lands to be turned over for section 8, low income housing, or other uses, later.  Certain combinations of these various acquisition strategies might also be considered. DoD's preferred option is to have alternative financing rather than direct government funds involved in the development of and operation of the worker housing.  Specific information requested is as follows:  strategies for 1) building, operating, and removing (or reusing) the worker housing;  2) assuring that if construction contractors provide housing for their workers, those workers will be provided consistent, minimum living standards which are in compliance with DoD and local standards.   Responses should include considerations of site and location, limitations of site and location, and any other pertinent information the responder deems should be brought to the attention of the DoD.   Interested firms are encouraged to respond to the Government's market survey questionnaire by downloading the associated market survey questionnaire form by clicking on the link associated with this Sources Sought Notice.  Marketing brochures or elaborate descriptions of the company are neither necessary nor desired. This market survey is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for the requested information. The Government will not provide a debriefing on the results of this survey nor will respondents be contacted regarding information gathered.  No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of this sources sought notice or Government use of any information provided.   As noted above, the Government intends to prepare and publicly present a summary of the results from this RFI.  Accordingly, interested parties are encouraged to mark their submissions to identify any proprietary information so as to avoid the release of that particular specific information.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL (RFP), AND A CONTRACT AWARD WILL NOT BE MADE FROM THE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF INTEREST.  The Statement of Interest is due thirty (30) days after this posting date. The maximum length of the Statement of Interest is seven (7) pages. POC: Jacob M. Punzalan, Contract Specialist (671) 339-5185 OR EMAIL: jacob.punzalan@navfacmar.navy.mil.

<DESC>OBJECTIVE AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTRACT

The Office of Infrastructure and Engineering in the Bureau for Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade (EGAT/I&E) will have technical management and responsibility for this Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC).  The purpose of this Infrastructure Sector IQC is to provide ready access to short and long-term professional technical assistance and capacity building in the areas of energy, information and communications technology (ICT), roads and transport, water and urban issues to USAID Washington and USAID missions abroad in countries that are assisted by USAID.  The tasks awarded under this contract will support USAID?s objective of fostering sustainable infrastructure development in USAID-assisted countries.

This contract shall complement and reinforce the activities of the I&E Office, other USAID Washington Pillar/Technical Bureaus, USAID Regional Bureaus, and USAID Regional and Bilateral Missions.  The contractor shall provide professional services and experienced personnel with the specific skills sets required in IQC Task Orders.  

The Infrastructure Sector IQC will address the following sectors:

A.	Energy 

Expanding access to modern energy services empowers people to take a major step out of poverty into a better future.  Energy increases economic growth, employment opportunities, private sector investment, and competitiveness; strengthens democracy and fosters political stability through improved transparency and communication; enhances national security; improves quality of life by enabling better health care, education, and access to clean water; and protects the environment and public health.  Unfortunately, more than 2 billion people, or one-third of the world?s population, have no access to electricity or other modern forms of energy.  Expanding access to safe, affordable, efficient, reliable and clean energy to power economic and social development is the cornerstone of USAID?s energy mission.

B.	Information and Communications Technology (ICT)

Information and communications technology (ICT) has become a powerful tool in the fight against world poverty, providing developing countries with an unprecedented opportunity to meet vital development goals, such as poverty reduction, basic health care, economic growth and education, far more effectively than before.  ICT depends on affordable access to telecommunications networks.  These include Internet (IP) networks as well as mobile phone networks, the latter increasingly being used for data applications as well as voice communications.  These networks can be used by the private sector, civil society and governments themselves.  Governments use ICT for e-government applications to improve the quality of services to citizens and businesses.

C.	Roads and Transport

In many countries, roads and highways provide the dominant mode of land transport and play a vital role in improving people?s lives and in contributing to national economic growth.  They often carry more than 80 percent of passenger-km and over 50 percent of freight ton-km in a country.  Consequently, roads and highways form the backbone to the economy and provide essential links to the vast local and community (rural) road networks.  Sea and air ports also provide important entry ways for the movement of goods and people.

D.	Water and Sanitation

Water is essential to life, and because over one billion people still lack access to safe water and nearly two billion lack safe sanitation, more than three million people die every year from avoidable water-related disease. Water security is a rapidly growing issue.  The poor are particularly vulnerable when water is either unclean or in short supply.  At the same time, water is a key development ingredient that impacts on a variety of factors that sustain and enhance life, as well as serving as a major input for industrial production (e.g., food processing). 

E.	Urban Management

Over 90 per cent of the world's population growth in the coming two decades will occur in developing cities - most of it in urban slums.  In the absence of sound governance and management practices, rapid urbanization will harm the environment.  It will also create life threatening water shortages, deplete valuable natural resources, strangle economic growth, widen income disparities and increase the spread of disease. However, well-managed cities can become engines of economic growth, enhance national prosperity, and increase both domestic harmony and international goodwill.  In a global and increasingly urbanized world, cities play a key role in building a better future.  Cities and local governments need the skills and tools to manage their resources effectively, deliver critical urban services, partner with the private sector, and foster economic growth for the betterment of their citizens.

<DESC>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE REPLACES AND SUPERSEDES Sources Sought Notice Reference-Number-FA8217-08-R-TBD3 posted on 26 Feb 08.   

This Sources Sought Synopsis constitutes a Request for Information to assist the Air Force in conducting Market Research.  This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the Air Force potential requirements for the development, test, and delivery of one pre-production Remote Generator Controller (RGC), and the possibility of an Option for up to 3 EA follow-on production units.    The RGC must interface with both the Mobile Electric Power (MEP) MEP-806B (GENSET) and the Joint Treat Emitter (JTE) Threat Emitter Unit (TEU) to control the generator operations.  This control includes but is not limited to start, monitor, adjust report status messages to the exact format that the JTE is expecting, and shut down of the GENSET. This development phase is expected to take approximately 6-10 months.

The RGC must be a kit that can be installed in the field by Military Power Production technicians by installing the kit on existing GENSET.  The environmental requirements for the RGC must meet or exceed those of the GENSET.   The government does not have a competitive bid package for the digital interface to the GENSET.  Interested parties should clearly identify with supporting rationale if they have the ability to meet the requirements without this competitive bid package from the Government.  

As part of the associated data package (drawings, data and software necessary for the maintenance and/or competitively contracted maintenance) the Air Force desires to receive no less than "government purpose rights."  If a responding company is not able to meet this requirement, a detailed of list of rights should be included in the response.

All pricing arrangements ae being considered.  However, a rsponding company must provide rationale if they believe that a firm-fixed-price pricing arrangement is not appropriate for the pre-production unit price and/or the production unit price. 

Each interested entity that has the capability to meet the requirements identified above hereby has the opportunity to provide supporting rationale that they can meet the identified requirements; each response may also include any other additional information that is requested within the Sources Sought Synopsis.  The Government also requests that each interested entity also provide a ROM (Rough Order of Magnitude) price for the development/pre-production unit and a ROM price for three follow-on production units; note that delivery of these ROMs is not required.  Note that any response with price data provided to this Sources Sought will not be used to make an award decision, or to obligate the Government in any way. 

Please respond to:  Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, OO-ALC/84 CBSG/PKR; Attn: James G. Thiros; 6039 Wardleigh Road, Bldg. 1206; Hill AFB; UT 84056-5838 (or e-mail: James.Thiros@hill.af.mil), fax (801) 586-3366.

Responses are due no later than 1600 (4:00 PM) MST on 12 March 2008.  No phone responses will be accepted.  

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this sources sought synopsis/Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.

The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service (NTIS) in Springfield, VA, is currently performing market research to determine what order processing software currently exists in the marketplace from various vendors that can be used to take and track orders for approximately 3 million technical documents in its permanent collection and track revenue and costs across all product and service lines. Documents are available in a variety of formats, such as paper, microfiche, electronic download, diskette, audio-visual and CD-ROM. NTIS handles demand requests for specific titles and maintains annual subscriptions with varying frequencies. Each year, NTIS adds 30,000 titles to the collection, processes approximately 38,000 demand orders, ships 80,000 demand copies, maintains over 7,400 active subscriptions and ships 53,000 subscription copies. In addition, NTIS provides distribution services to other federal agencies, processing 56,200 orders and shipping nearly 12 million copies, much of this in bulk, freight shipments.

NTIS currently operates a legacy system that hosts a commercially available order processing, accounts receivable and inventory software package developed by Computer Information Services, Inc. that has been heavily customized to NTIS specifications. The software was originally developed for the commercial publishing industry and runs on Hewlett Packard (HP) equipment, employing a HP-Unix operating system with shared disk space and multiple computer network access. The order processing system has been in place for over ten years. It is aging, highly customized, overly complex, and lacks certain flexibilities, such as adjusting for a change in the frequency of a subscription product. The existing system is not supported by the private sector. 

Vendors of commercial order processing software/system are requested to respond in writing or by e-mail to the following three elements to the POC no later than 21 March 2008.  --
--  Vendors may respond to all or any of the following three elements.  Vendors who submit a response will be added to the interested bidders list.  Vendors that do not submit a RFI response but desire to be included in the interested bidders list should contact the POC and notify him of their interest. 
--  Vendors that submitted a response to Solicitation Number SB1342-OPS, "Commercially Available Software for Order Processing" issued on January 29, 2008, are not required to submit a response to this request. 

(1) Vendor "Yes/No" Response to Specific Functional Requirements. Vendors are requested to download copies of Documents 2, 3, and 4 from www.ntis.gov/os_rfi. 
--  Document 1 is a copy of this request. 
--  Document 2, Key Definitions, identifies critical terms used in the other documents. --
--  Document 3, System Requirements, specifies the actual requirements of the order processing system and the relative weight NTIS attaches to each requirement. Vendors should fill in the column marked "Vendor Yes/No Responses" with the appropriate response. 
--  To assist vendors in understanding the context in which these System Requirements were developed, Document 4, Use Cases, is provided. A "use case" is a technique used in software and systems engineering to capture the functional requirements of a system.  

(2) Additional Comments on Specific Functional Requirements. Although the System Requirements Document attempts to capture all necessary information, vendors should provide as much additional information as they deem appropriate on the following aspects of their products: (1) ease in taking and tracking orders quickly and efficiently; (2) ability to generate, report and download data necessary for tracking revenue, cost of goods sold, and production data (subscriptions, subscribers, copies, etc.) across all product lines to generate auditable financial data and statements in accordance with generally acceptable accounting principles, including requirements of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board and the Office of Management and Budget; (3) ability to track inventory simply, maintain accurate inventory balances and cost; (4) ease of accessing sales and marketing data to analyze product sales patterns and market NTIS products to new and existing customers; (5) ability to ensure that products are shipped quickly and efficiently; (6) ease of maintenance; and (7) extent to which various modules (e.g., finance, order fulfillment, inventory) are able to communicate easily using a web service or similar technology.

(3) Vendor's Product Specifications. Please indicate (1) the name of the company that owns the software product and its version number; (2) the name of the company that owns the copyright to the software product; (3) its technical capabilities in as much detail as possible; (4) the types of network environments in which it may be deployed; (5) whether the software is Web accessible, (6) its security features; 7) whether the product may be administered remotely; (7) the operating systems on which platform applications may be deployed; (8) the type of database underlying the application(s) or the brand name of the database(s) upon which the system relies; (9) the type of interaction the database allows (i.e., ODBC or proprietary API, etc.); (10) whether the system(s) can use Web services and, if so, what is the underlying technology (e.g., SOAP), and (11) whether the software product(s) is Section 508 compliant by submitting a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, available at http://www.access-star.org/ITI-VPAT-v1.2.html. (12) Please indicate whether the software may be purchased as a stand-alone product or whether it must be purchased as a "bundle" that includes other software products for which licenses must also be purchased,(13) detailed description of security features, (14) Please indicate whether the software (and any other bundled products)is available for ordering through any GSA Federal Supply Schedule and/or any Government Wide Acquisition Contracts, and if so, the contract numbers for those contracts. (15) Please provide commercial list price information (NOT SPECIFIC PROPOSAL PRICING).

There would be approximately 50 users in one location (Springfield, Virginia).

VENDORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT NTIS IS WILLING TO CONSIDER SOME CHANGES TO ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES TO ACCOMMODATE AN AFFORDABLE ORDER PROCESSING SYSTEM THAT GENERALLY MEETS ITS NEEDS.

<OFFADD>Department of the Air Force, Air Mobility Command, 6th Contracting Squadron, 2606 Brown Pelican Ave., MacDill AFB, FL, 33621-5000, UNITED STATES
<SUBJECT>R -- INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.  It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This agency intends to award to Telos Corporation, 19886 Ashburn Road, Ashburn, VA 20147-2358 off of their GSA Schedule contract # GS-35F-4315D.

USSOCOM at MacDill AFB, FL requires TELOS Automated Messaging Handling System computer software.  AMHS computer software allows users to log into the command?s Defense Messaging System (DMS) server via a web based interface.  This gives USSOCOM users the capability of sending and receiving collateral SECRET DOD Organizational Messages.  The commands messages are archived and cataloged on the DMS server through a built-in database that is controlled by a Microsoft Structure Query Language (SQL) database, which allows the retrieval of historical messages.  The software also centralizes and reduces the amount of FORTEZZA cards needed throughout the infrastructure because of its unique web interface feature

A contract for the AMHS computer software will be awarded to Telos Corporation following no response back to this notice of intent.  The justification for the use of this brand name description in the acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company. The reason for this is the TELOS AMHS software is proprietary software that is designed for the Defense Messaging System (DMS). The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) mandated that all DOD agencies use TELOS AMHS software to process DMS message traffic 

The TELOS AMHS software is a Department of Defense initiative, and mandated for use throughout DOD through the Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI).  Telos Corporation is the only contractor found able to supply these items as we require.  If no response to this notice is received by Noon (12:00PM) EST on March 18, 2008, the award for these services will be made to Telos Corporation.  The POC for this notice is Barbara A. Squitieri, Contract Specialist, Phone: (813) 828-3978; Fax (813) 828-5111, Email: barbara.squitieri@us.af.mil.  Please use this contact information for any questions.

Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read: 22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Solicitation number AG349BS088178 is being issued as a request for quotation. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24. This requirement is a total Small Business Set-aside for NAICS 541712, small business size standard of 500 employees. Contractors are responsible for reading and complying with this entire combined synopsis/ solicitation and monitoring website, http://www.fbo.gov for any additional information relating to this requirement. Submission of quotations shall be in accordance with the instructions identified under Item A.5, Instructions for submission of quotations listed below. All information requested as identified under Item A.5, Items A through E shall be submitted with quotation.

Companies with the demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide specified services in accordance with the specified delivery schedule are invited to respond to this request.

BACKGROUND: The USDA National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture (NCCCWA) is conducting experiments to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms in rainbow trout. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are one base pair differences in DNA sequences between individuals of a population that are used as genetic markers. NCCCWA is constructing Reduced Representation Libraries (RRLs) in an effort to discover SNPs using both Sanger and 454 Sequencing technologies.

(A.1) STATEMENT OF WORK - The USDA NCCCWA requires Sanger Sequencing and 454 Sequencing on specific Reduced Representation Libraries (RRLs) and Bioinformatics to identify specific Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications contained in this document.  The contractor shall provide all services, supplies, equipment and facilities necessary to provide the deliverables specified below.

Item 01. The NCCCWA will evaluate 5 restriction enzymes for use in creating RRLs and provide three such libraries to the contractor to obtain sequences via Sanger protocols for 960 reads each. Government will provide libraries to contractor within 45 calendar days of award.

Deliverable 01. Contractor shall utilize Government provided RRLs to obtain sequences via Sanger protocols for a total of 2880 chromatograms (960 x 3 libraries) having average read length of 500 Phred 20 base pairs or better.  

Submission of Deliverable 01 for review and approval shall be by FTP or other Government approved method.  Required delivery date is 30 calendar days after receipt of libraries. 

Item 02. Upon approval and acceptance of Deliverable 01, the NCCCWA will evaluate sequences provided under Deliverable 01, choose optimal enzymes for SNP discovery and create 4 RRLs using the selected enzymes. Two of these libraries will be constructed using DNA from clonal lines; two more will be constructed from pooled DNA samples from NCCCWA broodstock. The NCCCWA requires 454 sequencing for half runs for each of 2 clonal line samples and the 2 pooled samples for a total of 4 half runs. Government will provide libraries to contractor within 20 calendar days after receipt of Deliverable 01.

Deliverable 02. Contractor shall utilize first set of Government provided RRLs to obtain sequencing from 4 - half runs of 454 sequences on RRLs created from 2 clonal lines and 2 pooled diploid samples.
a.   200,000 or better reads per half run having average read lengths of 250 base pair
b.   50 Mb per half run

Submission of Deliverable 02 for review and approval shall be by FTP or other Government approved method. Required delivery date is 30 calendar days after receipt of first set of RRLs.

Deliverable 02a. Contractor shall utilize second set of Government provided RRLs to obtain sequencing from 4 - half runs of 454 sequences on RRLs created from 2 clonal lines and 2 pooled diploid samples.
a. 200,000 or better reads per half run having average read lengths of 250 base pair
b. 50 Mb per half run

Submission of Deliverable 02a for review and approval shall be by FTP or other Government approved method. Required delivery date is 30 calendar days after receipt of second set of RRLs.

Item 03. Due to an evolutionarily recent genome duplication event, rainbow trout are undergoing the process of re-diploidization. The impact on SNP discovery is that divergent paralogous sequences may be mistaken for allelic variation. In this experimental design, SNPs identified within clonal lines, which are expected to be homozygous at all loci, must be ruled out as candidate SNPs. Assembly pipelines for SNP discovery must account for the genome duplication and assembly parameters shall include a stringency of greater than 94% identity over 100 base pairs.

The NCCCWA requires the identification of SNPs within and between these samples excluding those identified within clonal lines utilizing the following method or any other proposed method that is acceptable to the Government.
1. Identify SNPs within the entire sequencing dataset (combining all sequences from first and second sets of RRLs).
2. Identify SNPs within the four half runs of clonal lines and removal of them from the final report of SNPs. (SNPs identified between clonal lines are acceptable.)
Government will provide libraries to contractor within 20 calendar days after receipt of Deliverable 01.

Deliverable 03. Contractor shall provide identification of SNPs -report in tab delimited tables: 
a. SNPs identified within clonal lines
1. consensus sequence
2. position and type of sequence variants
3. number of observations for each variant (similar to minor allele frequency)

b. SNP Table - excluding those identified within clonal lines
1. consensus sequence
2. SNP variants (alleles) position
3. allele 1 (GAT or C)
4. allele 2 (GAT or C)
5. Minor Allele frequencies in pooled diploid samples
6. number of observations for each SNP

Submission of Deliverable 03 for review and approval shall be by FTP or other Government approved method. Required delivery date is 45 calendar days after receipt of first and second sets of libraries identified under Item 2.

Item 04. Sequence and SNP Data submission to GenBank Database. 

Deliverable 04. Upon approval and acceptance by the NCCCWA technical point of contact, Contractor shall submit all sequence and SNP data to the GenBank Database in accordance with submission requirements identified at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/submit.html

Government will provide review and approval for GenBank Database submission within 60 calendar days after receipt and acceptance of Deliverable 03. Required delivery date for GenBank Database submission is 10 calendar days after Government approval.  Government will provide final review and approval of GenBank Database submission within 10 calendar days. 

(A.2) SHIPMENT AND DOCUMENTATION - Shipment shall be FOB Destination to and shall be made between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays to USDA-NCCCWA, 11861 Leetown Road, Kearneysville, WV 25430.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis.  The NAICS Code is 511210.  It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Active Motif, 1914 Palomar Oaks Way, Suite 150, Carlsbad, CA 92008, to acquire licenses to Alma Bioinformatics, S.L., AlmaKnowledgeServer Version 2.1 (AKS2) text-mining software and maintenance support for a 12-month Base Period and three (3) successive 12-month Option Periods to support the NIH Human Salivary Proteome Project.  Active Motif is Alma Bioinformatics? sole authorized North American re-seller of AKS2 software and maintenance support.  The Human Salivary Proteome Project is a collaborative effort, co-funded by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) and CIT, to compile a catalog of proteins found in human saliva.  A Wiki-based system has been developed to store experimental data and to provide a platform for researchers in the community to annotate these proteins with their functions and other pertinent information.  In addition, another usage of the system will be to utilize ontologies and text-mining techniques for knowledge discovery and expertise identification.  To achieve this goal, CIT and NIDCR require a text-mining software application that must meet all of the following requirements of the knowledge discovery component of the Human Salivary Proteome Wiki: (1) Able to extract and categorize biomedical concepts from free text and uncover associations between diseases, genes/proteins, chemicals, drugs, etc; (2) Can map to external authoritative databases where users can retrieve additional information; (3) Provide for intuitive interfaces that allows users to visualize publication trends and relationship networks; (4) Include listings of all the NIH PubMed abstracts in which the concepts of interest are found; (5) Ability to identify experts in any areas of research; (6) Provide the option to install the tool locally to ensure the highest level of security for Government data; (7) Able to keep data up-to-date; and (8) Provide a flexible API that third party tools can use to efficiently query the system, without which the integration of the knowledge management component to the Human Salivary Proteome Wiki would be extremely difficult.  In addition, AKS2 provides the following additional unique functionalities:  (A) Uses an un-biased automated text-mining technology to extract associations from journal abstracts with little or no human curation; (B) Finds associations among not only biomolecules but also associations between biomedical terms and biological actions; (C) Allows customers to get weekly updates of processed journal abstracts; and (D) Offers a unique collection of visualization and reporting features for displaying literature information derived from text analysis.  To meet the needs of the researchers who use and contribute to the Human Salivary Proteome Wiki, AKS2 is necessary to enhance the knowledge discovery capability of the system.  The applications of this system are far-reaching, and CIT envisions its adoption in other proteome research communities as well.  CIT and NIDCR have determined that AKS2 is the only commercially available software that can meet all of the requirements stated above.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their software products and support specifications which will be considered by the agency.  Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide a software product that can fulfill all of the software requirements specified above.  Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This requirement is being processed for CIT and NIDCR by the National Library of Medicine (NLM).  NLM intends to make an award for this commercial item in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award.  Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at:  http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html.  Responses must be received by the NLM Point of Contact within ten (10) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM Synopsis No. 08-075/jc shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.  RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO: Joan Coulter at jc224a@nih.gov.  Inquiries regarding this notice may be made to Joan Coulter (301) 496-6546; Fax 301 402-0642.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement. The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for Air Force Behavioral Health Optimization in Primary Care Program (BHOP) Subject Matter Expert Support to Mountainview Consulting Group, Inc., Dr. Kirk Strosahl, PhD, Principal, is recognized as the technical matter expert in training of providers for the Air Force Behavioral Health Optimization in Primary Care Program (BHOP).  Dr. Strosahl developed the manual used for BHOP training across the Air Force and developed the integrated behavioral healthcare model of which the AF BHOP is composed.  Mountainview Consulting Group conducted all of the initial training and implementation of the AF BHOP and developed the copyrighted model.  Mountainview Consulting Group?s model is currently the only model with empirical evidence of both effectiveness and wide consumer and provider acceptance thus, the rationale for adopting this model.   Mountainview Consulting Group, Inc has proprietary rights in the training methods and materials and thus makes them the only source to able to provide the training and conduct the presentations.  Dr. Strosahl is identified, revered and actively marketed AF and DoD-wide as the leading expert and primary point of contact (POC) for BHOP training and consultation services. He has successfully established and continues to maintain key contacts, collaborative partnerships and effective working relationships throughout the AF for which he has earned a positive reputation as the recognized BHOP POC.  More recently he was selected as the DoD BHOP expert consultation for the implementation of this model across all of the military services.  His designated role as the BHOP Training Consultant has been incorporated into all  AF presentation and resource materials, all written program products and  in all training materials and training manuals produced, distributed and currently in use.  Moreover, Dr. Strosahl assisted in the development of all training materials and resource materials that are currently in use for this program throughout the AFMS.  Note:  All of the written materials used in BHOP were developed with Dr. Strosahl through use of his copyrighted materials. Dr. Strosahl is required for program continuity and fidelity, economic stewardship and consistency of currently existing and widely disseminated published products and resources, and for assurance of proper training of clinicians.  This is vital to ensure that patients are receiving the appropriate level of care and the model is being appropriately implemented therefore, he is the only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy this agency requirement. The 311 Human Systems Wing/PKBA intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because BHOP is the only model specifically used by the Air Force community. Questions should be directed to Robert T. Batkins via email: Robert T. Batkins@brooks.af.mil. Note 22 applies.

SINGLE MOLECULE MASS SPECTROMETER IN SOLUTION USING A SOLITARY NANOPORE

I. Invention Abstract

The invention of the single molecule mass spectrometer permits measurement of an electrical current passing through a stable nanopore under an applied voltage, while partial occlusion of the pore occurs by molecules that reduce the electrical current.  Reduction of the electrical current occurs because the nanopore's size is commensurate with that of the molecule. The nanopores may be modified to interact selectively with chosen targets. Specific averaging methods are used that, in effect, act as signal averaging of the individual currents and allows these current levels to be assigned to molecules of different sizes. In addition, the kinetics of the chemical interactions of the analytes within a given nanopore can be found once the current levels are assigned. The set of current levels together with the kineticsprovide a novel two-dimensional method of analysis for charged and uncharged molecules in solution.

A more complete description of the invention, its development and reduction to practice is presented in the attached article entitled "Single-Molecule Mass Spectrometer in Solution Using a Solita Nanopore," published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) of the United States of America, May 15,2007, volume 104, number. 20, pages 8207-8211.

II. Background
	
In carrying out its responsibilities to promote technology transfer under the Stevenson-Wydler Act of 1980(as amended by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA) of 1986) the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through its Office of Technology Partnerships (OTP) often seeks patent protection for inventions.   These inventions are developed at NIST laboratories during the course of scientific and technical activities carried on in support of the NIST mission. The decision to file a non-provisional patent application for a specific invention is made when NIST determines that a patent for the invention will significantly enhance the technology transfer/commercialization attractiveness of the invention to the private, for-profit sector.

V. Deliverables

The highly variable nature of the patent process and the large, diverse number of necessary interim work products often required to support the preparation, submission and prosecution of a patent application, make it difficult to specify the exact number, type and content or these work products or to prepare a schedule for their production and delivery.

NIST understands that decisions to prepare these interim products are within the realm of a patent attorney?s professional practice and dictated by what the attorney believes to be the ?best professional practice? in the client?s interest. No time schedule or list of work products can possibly anticipate all of the contingencies that can arise during the patent prosecution that require such products. Nevertheless, the following deliverable products have been identified for production and delivery to the intended recipients during this contract:

V.1-Non-Provisional Patent Application suitable for timely submission to the USPTO 	with all required supporting forms, declarations and other documentation.

V.2-All submissions, e.g., amendments to the application, prepared by the Contractor in 	response to first, second and subsequent office actions taken during the patent 	prosecution by the USPTO.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

Solicitation Number SB134108RQ0127 is issued as a request for quotation. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541199.  The NIST Technology Services Laboratory has a requirement for preparation, submission and prosecution of a Non-Provisional Patent Applications and an Accelerated Patent Application for the following National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Invention. Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide services in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW), Preparation, Submission and Prosecution of a Non-Provisional Patent Application for the following National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Invention:


I. Invention Abstract

The current state of the art to produce "cleaned and shortened" raw carbon nanotubes (CNTs) raw as provided staring material is to use combinations organic dispersants, high power ultra-sonication, strong mineral acids and oxidizers. While processing conditions can be: adjusted in attempts to minimize CNT damage, up to 90% of the CNTs are destroyed in the process of producing true nano-length scale purified CNTs. Another approach (unsuccessful) was to use "ball-milling" methods to process CNTs. This method is similar to crushing used in a mortar and pestle. Ball milling has been reported as being one of the most destructive methods to process CNTs. All current methods to process tubes have not been shown to be easily scalable. For example, sonication tends to form nano-bubbles inside the individual/freed chiral (less-stable) CNTs, which causes cavitations and subsequent side-wall damage. Before the CNs are "cut" by sonication, the cavitations "blowout" side walls leaving behind "moth eaten" tubes (as shown by SEM). Higher power and higher concentration samples cannot be processed using sonication. Strong acids, oxidizers or organic solvents have been used to process the CNTs but tend to destroy starting materials and chemically modify (oxidize) the CNTs.

Wrapping CNTs with expensive biopolymer molecules such as DNA to facilitate separation do not address the first steps of descaling, debulking, debundling, and catalyst removal outlined in this disclosure. DNA has been shown to be useful in size and chiral separation of already-processed-tubes. DNA, could however, be added once the CNT material has been sheared. sorted and cleaned with ethanol- additional processes to be discussed in future disclosures.

I. Invention Abstract
We describe a design for an atomic magnetometer that simultaneously achieves high sensitivity, simple fabrication and small size. This design is based on a diverging (or converging) beam of light (in a single spatial optical mode) that passes through an alkali atom vapor cell and that contains a distribution of beam propagation vectors. The existence of more than one propagation direction permits longitudinal optical pumping of the atomic system and simultaneous detection of the transverse atomic polarization. The design could be implemented with a micro-machined alkali vapor cell and light from a single semiconductor laser. A small modification to the cell contents and excitation geometry allows for use as a gyroscope.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

Solicitation Number SB134108RQ0129 is issued as a request for quotation. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541199.  The NIST Technology Services Laboratory has a requirement for preparation, submission and prosecution of a Non-Provisional Patent Applications and an Accelerated Patent Application for the following National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Invention. Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide services in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW), Preparation, Submission and Prosecution of a Non-Provisional Patent Application for the following National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Invention:


I.	Invention Abstract

The Orthogonal Tracking Microscope comprises a method and device for tracking particles in three dimensions. The method relies on a micro-fabricated sample chamber with integrated reflective optics.

Robust algorithms for finding the centroids of one or more particles in 2D digital images acquired by digital video microscopy are widely and freely available. Such methods require only that the signal to noise be above some threshold, and can routinely compute the lateral position of a tracked particle with spatial precision below 10 nm and temporal resolution limited only by the speed of the imaging camera. On the contrary, methods for tracking particles with this accuracy in three dimensions suffer from several drawbacks. The depth information (particle position along the optical axis of the microscope) is typically reconstructed from the Airy pattern ofa particle within a two-dimensional image. It is difficult in practice to match an experimentally acquired Airy pattern with a theoretical pattern calculated from diffraction theory. The forward problem of calculating an accurate Airy diffraction pattern from first principles is not only difficult but computationaIty expensive, and the inverse problem of deconvolving the depth information from an experimental Airy pattern is subject to many errors. Other methods of three dimensional tracking which do not rely on Airy pattern deconvolution require mechanical manipulation of the microscope stage and/or optics during video imaging; this limits the time resolution of the rnethod to some tens of milliseconds and limits the tracking capability to a single particle at a time.  
 
The new method for tracking particle position in three dimensions uses integrated reflective optics to obtain two (or more) images of a particle from orthogonal perspectives. The reflective optics provides a side-on view of the imaging volume. This view essentially translates the optical axis into a lateral axis, allowing a particle position along the optical axis to be imaged via conventional microscope geometries. This translation reduces the problem of tracking in three dimensions to the simpler problem of tracking in two dimensions twice. We may use established two-dimensional centroid-finding algorithms to accurately determine particle depth as well as lateral position.  
 
This invention obviates the complexity of solving the forward and inverse problems of Airy pattern deconvolution, and provides better accuracy. In cases where multiple particles are coincident in one image plane, the addition of an orthogonal imaging plane allows the unambiguous identification of particle positions in all three dimensions.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquistion Regulation as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  
The solicitation number H92222-08-R-0027 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-25.   The associated NAICS code is 333314 and the small business size standard is 500.  This acquisition is subject to the Non Manufacturer Rule of the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 13, Chapter 1.  The rule requires that small business bidders either be the actual manufacturer of the product or the provider (as a nonmanufacturer) of the product of another small business manufacturer.  If there are no small business manufacturers of the product being procured, a waiver to the nonmanufacturer rule would have to be requested from and approved by the SBA. All responsible small businesses may submit a quote, which shall be considered by the agency.
The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to procure the following item(s):

CLIN	0001	Description 	AN/PVS-7B Night Vision Goggles				Quantity   42	RDD  1 JULY 2008
							

The AN/PVS-7B is a single tube, bi-ocular night vision goggle configuration.  The system employs user-friendly controls, an integrated IR illuminator, and internal low battery and IR indicators.  The PVS/7 is light weight and significantly reduces operator fatigue compared to older heavier models.  The AN/PVS-7B can be operated for up to 40 hours, powered by two "AA" alkaline batteries.  In addition, the AN/PVS-7B has a quick-release lever that permits one-hand mounting and un-mounting, an IR-on indicator, and a low-voltage indicator.

The AN/PVS-7B must be equipped with filmed image intensification tubes with a figure of merit (FOM) below 1250, where the FOM is calculated by multiplying the signal to noise ratio by the resolutions measured in line pairs per millimeter.  The image intensification tube must not employ an auto-gating feature.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-08-R-625445 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.  This is a unrestricted procurement.  The NAICS is 332999.  

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.
