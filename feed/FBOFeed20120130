In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (15) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.  
AWARD WILL NOT BE WITHHELD AWAITING QUALIFICATION.  For qualification information/source approval requests contact OC-ALC/BC, 3001 Staff Drive, Ste #1AC85A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3009.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing the protective clothing kits, per the attached draft (SOW).

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

NASA is performing a Phase 1 effort to define interface requirements and operationsconcept and to perform risk assessment for the possible deployment of the BigelowExpandable Activity Module (BEAM) on the International Space Station.  As part of thiseffort, sensor systems are being assessed for measurement of different parameters ofinterest, including temperature.  To leverage off previous development and certificationefforts and to address operational and program constraints, the Wireless Strain GageInstrumentation (WSGIS)previously purchased from Invocon, Inc. has been identified as asystem to acquire temperature measurements.  However, due to differences from theoriginal Invocon application, firmware changes are required to use the WSGIS for BEAM. In addition, the update to the USB driver for the Enhanced Wideband Micro TriaxialAccelerometer Unit (TAU)family of systems is required to enable its operation with theT61P laptop that is used aboard the ISS. NASA already possesses the WSGIS hardware andother Invocon systems being affected by this change and the WSGIS firmware is proprietaryprotocol. Therefore, NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Invocon, Inc.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to Jennifer Krause at jennifer.krause-1@nasa.gov not later than 4:30p.m. local time on February 10, 2012.

<SUBJECT>Basic Notice: Standard Missile-3 Block IIB Missile Product Development Phase
<SOLNBR>HQ0276-12-R-0001
<CONTACT>Joy M. Smith, Procuring Contracting Officer, Phone 540-663-1984, Email joy.smith@mda.mil - Jennifer N. Brooks, Contract Specialist, Phone 5406637793, Email jennifer.brooks@mda.mil
<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice is being issued to communicate the Government's intent to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with FAR Part 15 for Full and Open Competition for the Development and Production of Standard Missile-3 Block IIB, or SM-3 IIB Interceptors. For planning purposes only, the Government anticipates the product development contract award in 1st quarter, FY14. At this time there are no anticipated partial or total set-asides for this acquisition. The Agency anticipates a single award.
<p>The Missile Defense Agency is responsible for developing a Ballistic Missile Defense System; integrating land, sea, air, and space based assets to defend the United States, friends, and allies, and deployed forces from ballistic missile attack. The SM-3 IIB is a key element to expanding the battle space by adding an additional layer to our homeland defense against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM). The goals of the program are to develop an operational, hit-to-kill missile fielded in the 2020 timeframe to counter first generation ICBMs targeted at the U. S. Homeland early in their flight. It will serve as the first tier of the layered defense of the U.S. Homeland. The SM-3 Block IIB missile will also provide a large defended area against regional, intermediate range ballistic missiles. The SM-3 IIB will be integrated into the Aegis Weapon System, using Aegis BMD 5.1 and the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System as a point of departure. The SM-3 IIB will be launched using Engage on Remote data, leveraging the BMD distributed sensor architecture and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) network of 2020. The SM-3 IIB is targeted for incorporation into Phase 4 of the President's Phased Adaptive Approach.</p>
<p>The successful offeror will need to demonstrate prime contractor experience in designing, developing, and manufacturing state-of-the-art ballistic missile defense interceptors, experience in land and/or sea-based interceptor system integration, and demonstrated interceptor production capability.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:<br />The following criteria have been developed to guide prospective offerors as to the priorities applied to evaluation of future technical proposals. These criteria are preliminary and may be modified prior to release of the final solicitation.</p>
<p>1. ICBM Defense Performance*<br />1.1. Defended Area of U.S. Homeland<br />1.2. Launch Area Denied<br />1.3. Level of protection <br />1.4. Maximize Government defined Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 4 operational architecture<br />1.5. Maximize reliability<br />* See paragraph CLASSIFIED ATTACHMENTS below, which describes how to request additional information.</p>
<p>2. Minimized Life Cycle Cost<br />1.1. Minimize modifications to Aegis Combat System<br />1.2. Simplicity of design for operations and sustainment<br />1.3. Minimize unit cost<br />1.4. Minimize fleet management cost of ICBM interceptors</p>
<p>3. Schedule Realism</p>
<p>As in all source selections, the Government will evaluate Technical, Management, Past Performance and Cost proposals.</p>
<p>FUTURE UPDATES:<br />This pre-solicitation notification as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov/. All interested offerors are encouraged to register at this website to receive email notifications when information related to this acquisition is updated or documents related to this acquisition are issued and available for download. The Government requests that all interested parties ensure they are listed on the "Interested Vendors List" in FBO. As a rule, the MDA will not send notifications directly to interested offerors and it is in the interested offeror's best interest to periodically check this website for updates.</p>
<p>The Government will conduct a Q&amp;A session to address questions related to the evaluation criteria no later than February 29, 2012. A subsequent announcement will be issued with further details.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order and is not a request for competitive proposals under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The government intends to solicit a quote and enter into a purchase order with Idaho Technology, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT.
<p>The Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM) at National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC), Bethesda, MD, would like to procure the following item with this vendor:</p>
<p>Item Number: RFIT-ASY-0001<br />Description: Film Array (FA) Respiratory Panels/Kit (30/pack) <br />Unit of Issue: Package <br />Quantity: 20<br /><br />The Clinical Center is a clinical research hospital providing medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Clinical Center (CC) provides patient care facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related areas, and other training programs. The Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM) and its Microbiology section supports this critical patient care mission through analysis/sampling of laboratory specimens generated from these research protocols.</p>
<p>The FA Respiratory Panel is a multi-plexed nucleic acid test intended for use with Idaho Technology Film Array Instrument for the simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of multiple respiratory viral nucleic acids in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from individuals.</p>
<p>Idaho Technology, Inc is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the above-referenced respiratory panels, which are used to help diagnose and treat patient disease in the Microbiology section of DLM. These panels are specific for the existing instrument (Idaho Technology Film Array Instrument, Serial Number FA1182), and are the only ones that can meet the needs of this patient care test and ongoing research protocols. It is therefore deemed in the Government's best interest that these items be procured through Idaho Technology, Inc.</p>
<p>There would be harm to DLM's ability to provide suitable patient care if we were to take a chance on other respiratory panels during ongoing research protocols, specifically due to our time-sensitive mission and short turn-around times on providing laboratory analysis in support of critical patient care. There would be great harm to the NIH Clinical Center and DLM/Microbiology section specifically if there were significant delays due to changing over respiratory panels during ongoing analysis.<br /><br />As this is an award to a Small Business, the Government shall consider all responses from Small Businesses, as verified through the Small Business Administration (SBA) or as reported at Central Contractor Registration (CCR), that are received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. All responses must be received before February 13, 2012, 12:00PM, Eastern Standard Time. The proposed award date will be approximately February 15, 2012. Please email Doug Reed, Contract Specialist, at douglas.reed@nih.gov with questions or capability statements pertaining to this notice. No phone calls please.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a purchase order and is not a request for competitive proposals under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The government intends to solicit a quote and enter into a sole source purchase order, base and four (4) option years with Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc., Newark, DE.
<p>The Clinical Center is a clinical research hospital providing medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Clinical Center (CC) provides patient care facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related areas, and other training programs. The Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM) supports this critical patient care mission through analysis/sampling of laboratory specimens generated from these research protocols.</p>
<p>This requirement is a reagent rental used for a Research Development Program within the Department of Laboratory Medicine (DLM). The reagents used must be in compliance and suitable for use with the Siemens Immulite 1000 Immunoassay System.</p>
<p>The reagent rental agreement includes the complimentary use of the Siemens Immulite 1000 in exchange for annual reagent supply purchases (specifically, Immulite 1000 Cortisol, Immulite CON6 Multivalent Control Modul, Immulite LKPM Cleaning Kit, Immulite LSCP Sample Cups, Immulite LPWS2 Probe Wash, and Immulite LSUBX Substrate), as well as on-site basic maintenance service (8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday), and Immulite 1000 training for one (1) technologist.</p>
<p>The complimentary use of this equipment in exchange for annual reagent supply purchases results in a cost savings to the Government, and is therefore in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there would be harm to DLM's ability to provide suitable patient care if we were to take a chance on other reagents/equipment changeovers during ongoing research protocols, specifically due to our time-sensitive mission and short turn-around times on providing laboratory analysis in support of critical patient care. There would be great harm to the NIH Clinical Center and DLM specifically if there were significant delays due to changing over reagents/equipment.</p>
<p>The Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. All responses must be received before February 7, 2012, 12:00PM Eastern Standard Time. The proposed award date will be on or before February 21, 2012.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to inform all firms about an upcoming competitive requirement for an undetermined number of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA's) for installation and alteration support services for Aircraft Launch and Recovery Equipment (ALRE) and Support Equipment (SE) at both shipboard and shore site locations for NAVAIR in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW). A five-year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) will be issued to offerors that successfully meet the evaluation criteria. <br /><br />This synopsis is for informational purposes only. A formal solicitation will be issued in the near future. All offerors competing for the issuance of a BOA will be required to submit a Technical, Past Performance, and Cost Volume. The cost volume will be for informational purposes only and will be used to help facilitate future Task Order (TO) awards should a BOA be awarded after evaluation of submissions. Issuance of BOA's will be based on evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth in the formal solicitation. A basic ordering agreement is not a contract. Each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions of the BOA.<br /><br />Firms issued a BOA may receive requests for proposals leading to award of orders. Evaluation factors for award of specific orders will be based on factors as deemed desirable and set forth for each specific requirement. Specific orders will be competed among those firms issued a BOA. <br /><br />Under this BOA program, firms selected for a BOA will compete on TO's for requirements. The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities Page website (http://www.fbo.gov) and the Naval Air Systems Command Business Opportunities Page (https://webadmin.navair.navy.mil/navair/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.display&amp;key=OpenSolicitations) for new entrants once a year or at intervals that will guarantee adequate competition. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement. <br /><br />The labor mix and estimated man-hours of direct labor for performance will be determined at the TO level. The total estimated ceiling over the 5 years for ALRE installation and support services is $49,407,934. The approximate range in value of orders is expected to be $1500 to $3.64M. The foreseen average number of orders per year is 16. <br />

<DESC><br />The Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Submarine Security &amp; Technology Branch (N87C5) of the Chief of Naval Operations' (CNO) Undersea Warfare Division (N87) are interested in receiving proposals focused on the identification of science and physics based signal detection technologies that, individually or as a system, can impact the security of the SSBN and the survivability of the SSGN/SSN submarine forces. Passive and active detection technologies with near term (0-5 years), mid-term (5-10 years) and far term (10-20 years) implications will be considered.
<p><br />As part of its effort to understand the impact of technology on submarine security and survivability, the SSBN Security Technology Program (SSTP) may entertain proposals focused on improving the understanding of the generation, radiation, propagation, scatter, and detection of a variety of signal types (acoustic, chemical, optical, electromagnetic, hydrodynamic and radiological) associated with a submarine's operation. The SSTP is currently placing emphasis on Science and Technology (S&amp;T) related to acoustic, optical, electromagnetic, and hydrodynamic phenomenology.</p>
<p>The ONR is seeking participants for this program that are capable of performing advanced S&amp;T research that support demonstrating capabilities to achieve the goals described in this announcement.</p>

This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.201, for Full and Open Competition after exclusion of sources and FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The Office of Surface Mining, Western Region, 1999 Broadway, Denver, Colorado, 80202 has a requirement to procure the following item:
Statement of Objectives for Server Client LicensesTechnical Innovation and Professional Services (TIPS) uses a software license management package to manage twenty-nine licensed software packages.  By utilizing software that can track check-out and usage of these software packages TIPS has saved millions of dollars by avoiding purchases of software licenses that are not needed for concurrent use.
ObjectivesTo use an integrated software asset management suite for automated IT asset auditing and software license management.  The software will show whats installed on our network and report details about its usage.  It will also control access to licensed software and run detailed deployment and usage reports for the entire organization or for specific departments.  
This software will need to integrate enterprise-wide software and essential hardware auditing and automatically keep audit information current for desktop and portable computers using a transparent, incremental, auto-discovery protocol.
TIPS requires built-in and customizable reports that can be scheduled for periodic execution.  These reports need to provide an integrated view of software and hardware asset allocation, software usage patterns, and license compliance for all of our computers using Windows applications.  Reports should be readable in any web browser with either public or authenticated access.  The software architecture will need to be based on a dedicated network server process using its own highly optimized network protocol and scalable to support hundreds of client computers.
The Government intends to award a sole source contract to:Sassafras Software, Inc., PO Box 150, Hanover, NH 03755
The Government will consider all responses received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.201, for Full and Open Competition after exclusion of sources and FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The Office of Surface Mining, Western Region, 1999 Broadway, Denver, Colorado, 80202 has a requirement to procure the following item:

<DESC>This procurement is restricted to Service Disable Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms.  The requirement is for the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center, 921 NE 13th Street, Oklahoma City, OK 73111. This requirement is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Applicable NAICS code is 541330 and small business size standard of $4.5 Million. 

This project will engage an Architect Engineering firm to utilize professional engineering services to provide a design analysis of the current facility infrastructure at the Oklahoma City VA Medical Center and the Lawton Outpatient Clinic for Project 635-12-304, Generator Power Survey.  This study specifically will involve: 

1.	The requirements for the installation of additional natural gas generating capacity, along with the accompanying generator enclosures, electrical switchgear, transfer switches and breakers, feeders, and electrical components such that the end result is enough electrical generator capacity to handle the peak loads of the entire Oklahoma City VA Medical Center and the Lawton VA Outpatient Clinic such that the hospital and the clinic can continue all normal operations for a minimum of 96 hours without commercial power. The Scope of Work will also include:

a.	An analysis of the existing electrical systems of the medical center along with historic energy consumption information to determine the size of the additional generator capacity necessary to achieve the 100% backup power goal with additional capacity for reasonable future growth.
b.	Recommendations for new facility infrastructure and modifications to current facility systems in order to achieve the 100% backup power goal.
c.	Interviews with stakeholders to determine other critical factors for the design.
d.	Conceptual drawing equaling approximately 35% of a complete design effort.
e.	A preliminary cost estimate detailing the actual construction of the work contained in the project scope.  The estimate must contain sufficient details to allow for accurate budgeting of the future construction project.

Design completion timeframe is estimated to be 150 days after receipt of the Notice to proceed. The A/E firm shall also be required to perform construction period services after award of the construction contract. 

Qualifications (SF330) submitted by each firm will be reviewed and evaluated based on the following criteria in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.602-1 and VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) Part 836-602-1 as follows: 

1) Professional Qualifications: the qualifications of the individuals which will be used for these services will be examined for relevant work experience and accredited education (Bachelors of Science in the specific field minimum) and their record of working together as a project team. The specific state licensed/registered professional disciplines which will be evaluated are a minimum one of each (Oklahoma licensed architect, electrical engineer,fire protection engineer, cost estimator, AutoCAD operator).  Note that lead engineer must be Oklahoma P.E. 
(2) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence: specific experience and technical skill in the type and scope of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in designing for federal agencies, healthcare design, eldercare design, research abilities for EBD (evidence based design, knowledge of 2010 ADA Standards & NFPA 101 Life Safety codes, Knowledge of Joint Commission and HIPPA requirements, energy conservation, and the use of recycled materials. 
(3) Capacity to Accomplish the Work: the general work load and staffing capacity of the design office which will be responsible for 51% of the design, and the ability to accomplish the work in the required time will be evaluated. This includes ability to produce scaled construction documents in minimum version AutoCAD 2010. 
(4) Past Performance: the past performance of the firm on contracts relevant in scope to the advertised project that were accomplished with the Department of Veterans Affairs, other federal agencies, and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules will be examined. Project past performance references older than 3 years will not be accepted. 

(5) Claims and Terminations: record of significant claims against the firm or terminated contracts because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services will be examined. 
(6) Location of Design Firm: the geographic proximity of each firm to the location of the VA Medical Center will be evaluated. This criterion will apply to the office from which the majority of the design services will be performed.  Firms within 250 miles of the medical center will receive a maximum score. Firms more distant than 250 miles will receive a zero score for this criterion. 
(7) Memberships in professional associations: Each professional discipline has voluntary associations such as (AIA, ASID, AAHID, NSPE). The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes that professionals who maintain association memberships are more invested in their field and are therefore more knowledgeable about current industry trends. 

Submission Requirements:
This procurement is 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). Qualified SDVOSB firms are required to submit: 2 copies of Standard Form (SF) 330 (available at http://www.gsa.gov/forms) to include Part 1 and Part 2.

In addition, firms are requested to provide one electronic copy of their entire SF330 submittal via CD. Submission information incorporated by reference is not allowed. 

FAILURE TO CLEARLY ADRESS ALL SEVEN LISTED EVALUATION CRITERIA AND INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THE SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS ABOVE MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF SF330. 

Prospective SDVOSB firms are reminded that in accordance with VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 852.219-10, at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance of the contract shall be spent for employees of the SDVOSB concern or employees of other eligible service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.

Failure to become registered and verified in the VetBiz registry will result in denial of contract award. After receipt of verification application, the VA Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) will conduct an SDVOSB verification investigation of the firm and based upon their findings will either find the firm eligible or ineligible for SDVOSB verification. Any AE firm that represents itself as an SDVOSB eligible firm but subsequently found ineligible for verification by VA OSDBU will result in that firm being barred from contract award. Interested firms are reminded that in accordance with FAR 4.12, prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications (ORCA) in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov database, prior to award of a contract (FAR 4.11).

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Our current position is to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The 377th Civil Engineer Group, KirtlandAir Force Base (Albuquerque) NM 87117 requires a bridge contract to succeed contract FA9401-11-C-0010 which expires on 31 Mar 12. The new bridge contract will consist of a nine (9) month basic period of performance with nine (9) 1-month options. AFNWC/PKOC anticipates making an award to Chugach Management Services, Joint Venture (CMSJV), 3800 Centerpoint Drive, Ste 601, Anchorage, AK 99503. Interested parties may e-mail susan.mcdaniel@kirtland.af.mil or fax 505-846-5744, Attn: Susan McDaniel, not later than 6 Feb 12, 3:00 p.m. MST.
<p>IAWFAR Part 5.207(c) (15), the proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government anticipates to solicit and negotiate withonly one (1) source under the authority of FAR 6.302. All responsible parties may identify their interest and submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the government. This current position is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within five (5) business days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. Responsible parties must clearly demonstrate in the submitted documents that there will be no service interruptions and no added investment and start-up costs associated with award of a bridge contract to any contractor other than the incumbent contractor. Documentation submitted will not exceed five (5) pages and will be submitted electronically to the cognizant Contracting Officer listed in the first paragraph above. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, supervision, vehicles, services, and other items necessary to perform base civil engineer functions in support of KirtlandAir Force Base and other geographically separated locations. This consists of Admin Management, Customer Support; Facility/Infrastructure Maintenance and Support, Operations (Physical Plant Operations), Grounds Maintenance, Real Property Management, Logistics Support (Material Control), Civil Engineer Computer Systems Management, Readiness/Emergency Management, Disaster Preparedness/Disaster Response. Contractor must comply with all standard commercial practices, Federal, State, and local laws in the performance of this contract. <br />In summary, several contractors can perform these services on a long-term basis; however, there is only one (1) contractor (CMSJV) who appears to be capable of performing these services on a short-term basis (i.e., bridge contract) with no service interruptions and without added investment and start-up costs.&emsp;</p>

<DESC>This is a Service Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform educational training services.
The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) - Division of Performance and Accountability is planning a Principal Leadership Academy. The following requirements are needed to implement the Academy:
The purpose of the BIE Principal Leadership Academy (PLA) is to prepare principals to achieve rapid and sustained improvement of their schools by providing them with training, mentoring, and support. The training will focus on the principal's role in setting direction, managing change, engaging people, and improving instruction. The mentoring and support will ensure that training is effectively translated into practice. Principals successfully meeting the requirements of the program will be certified as Rapid Improvement Leaders. Certified Rapid Improvement Leaders will be eligible to serve as Rapid Improvement Mentors for subsequent cohorts of principals.
The goals of the Principal Leadership Academy are:Goal 1. Content. BIE will develop training and support curriculum and protocol that effectively prepare in-service principals to lead the rapid improvement of their schools.Goal 2. Standards. BIE will establish rigorous training and implementation standards as criteria for principals earning recognition as Certified Rapid Improvement Leaders.Goal 3. Delivery. BIE will deliver the one-year PLA program to two cohorts of principals, reaching a total of 100 principals.Goal 4. Output. Seventy-five percent of the principals who enter the Principal Leadership Academy will earn recognition as Certified Rapid Improvement Leaders.Goal 5. Outcome. Schools whose principals earn recognition as Certified Rapid Improvement Leaders will achieve gains on NWEA assessments in reading and mathematics of at least 20 percentage points in two years following the principal's entry into the Academy.
Rationale"School districts are struggling to attract and retain an adequate supply of highly qualified candidates for leadership roles" (Knapp, Copland & Talbert, 2003).This is indicative of the schools and ELOs in the ADD, East and West; a common phenomenon is the recycling of known ineffective principals across schools in regions of the ADDs.
"Principal Candidates and existing principals are often ill-prepared and inadequately supported to organize schools to improve learning while managing all of the other demands of the job" (Young, 2002; Levine, 2005).Current school assessment data reflects a limited ability of BIE school principals to implement research-based strategies and approaches to improving teaching and learning; further, information provided by line offices and schools indicates an extreme weakness in principals having a global understanding of schooling and certainly, a lack of managing the resources necessary to attain that knowledge. The ADD, East and West also have a shortage of "highly qualified administrators, seeking to or committed to working in underserved communities and schools," which are more rural and miles from large towns or cities.
Eight of the nine Education Line Offices in the ADD East provided information on the number of years principals have held this leadership position. Approximately 64% of the principals in these eight line offices have more than 5-years experience; with 4% possessing 11-29 years experience in a principal position.
Seven Education Line Offices in the ADD West provided information on the number of years principals have held this leadership position. Approximately XX% of the principals in these seven line offices have less than 5 years experience; XX% of the principals have more than 5 years experience with XX% possessing 10+ years experience in a principal position.
Research suggests that the successful school leader influences student achievement in several important ways, both through their influence on other people or features of their organization, and through their influence on school processes. Following is a general expectation of skills necessary for BIE principals to be able to embrace and utilize to impact student achievement through school improvement.  
Project StructureThe Principal Leadership Academy will be directed by a project manager and core management team and designed, developed, and delivered by three teams.Management Team - provides project leadership and directionDesign Team - creates content framework, critiques certification criteria and recommends candidates for certification.Development Team - creates materials, recommends certification criteria, and trains instructors and mentors.Instruction and Mentoring Team - trains principals, monitors principal's implementation, and mentors principals.
Program ComponentsThe Principal Leadership Academy will include the following program components:
1. Orientation: Two webinars prior to Basic Leadership Training to discuss reading assignments and review project goals and timelines.2. Basic Leadership Training: Four full days of training in the summer focused on:a. Setting direction (rapid improvement leadership indicators)b. Managing change (team processes and data use)c. Engaging people (communication, motivation, coordination of all stakeholders, including tribal councils, school boards, parents, and teachers)d. Improving instruction (full implementation of indicators of effective instruction)3. Implementation: Upon completion of the Basic Leadership Training, principals will implement two strands of work: 1) Project tasks assigned by the PLA, and 2) Individually-designed project created by each participant within guidelines established by the PLA.4. Mentorship: Each principal will be assigned a mentor (one mentor will assist 5-8 principals) who will review the principal's work in Native Star and provide feedback through the year. Each mentor will hold a monthly webinar with his/her mentees. Mentors will document their interactions in the PLA management system.5. Site Visits: Each principal's school will be visited by the mentor for a two-day site review and consultation at least twice during the year.6. Mid-Year Training: In January following the summer Basic Leadership Training, the principals will meet for a 3-day Mid-Year Training.7. Summative Meeting: The principals will meet for three days in the summer at the end of the year-long project to present their portfolios of work, plan next steps, and, for those meeting certification criteria, a graduation ceremony.
Data and Management SystemsThree web-based systems will be integral to the project:1. NWEA's assessment and data systems2. Native Star's improvement systems, including the indicators guiding the Management Team and the special Rapid Improvement Leader system for the principal and mentor3. A Project Management System, to document the implementation of the project and inform its evaluation

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to seek sources interested in developing, implementing, and maintaining in-store marketing programs. There is no solicitation package available nor does this commit the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) to issue a solicitation or make any award(s). DeCA is seeking companies interested in planning, implementing, and maintaining no cost and/or revenue producing cutting edge technological solutions used in retail to provide in-store marketing, informational tools, and other value added consumer services. As examples, programs may include entrance marketing, health and wellness and ordering kiosks, in-store TV advertising, interactive advertising as well as other tools that are currently in or being tested in the marketplace. Any costs associated with the development, execution, and continuing management of an offeror's program will be borne by the offeror and at no cost to DeCA. Offerors may present multiple programs to DeCA. Offers should include a complete listing of trading partners (other retailers) where the offeror's programs are currently in use.&nbsp; <br /><br />
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Defense Commissary Agency is a Department of Defense (DoD) Agency that manages and operates supermarkets for the Armed Services throughout the world, with annual sales of over $5.9 billion. Currently, there are 247 stores in DeCA, 178 are located stateside to include Alaska and Hawaii. The remaining balance of stores are located elsewhere throughout the world. For more information on DeCA you may go to <a href="http://www.commissaries.com/">www.commissaries.com</a>. The commissary benefit exists for the Service members, military retirees, and their dependents. As such, the commissary presents a family friendly environment and projects such image to its patrons. Marketing or advertising shall not display or consist, in whole or in part, of ads for cigarettes, condoms, alcohol, or any product or service that is contrary to DeCA's family-friendly environment or that is illegal in the jurisdiction of the commissary locations. Advertising should generally be limited to products carried in the commissaries although cross advertising of items and services in other military resale and/or MWR programs may be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proposed programs must meet DeCA's objectives, to include thorough, professionally devised concepts delivered in a consistent fashion throughout the Agency's stores. These programs must be flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of store sizes and layouts, varied and compressed operating schedules, and dissimilar product assortments and department mixes, both in stateside and overseas locales. They must also demonstrate their impact on patron use, whether it be through sales lift, customer spending habits, and/or patron acceptance/use. It is anticipated that the DeCA total advertising/marketing, informational, and customer services program will blend multiple approaches to the delivery of: (1) product and service advertising, (2) the enhancement of manufacturers and brand equity within the commissary system, (3) the distribution of coupons, (4) health and wellness services, and (5) the delivery of other value added services aimed at maximizing the customer shopping experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Offerors are required to furnish all supervision, personnel, and unique services necessary to implement and maintain its advertising program within DeCA worldwide. Programs offered may make use of existing commissary equipment (e.g., gondolas) and physical plant (e.g., walls, floors, overhead areas) provided that program elements/equipment are DoD compliant and are compatible with and do not reduce the operational efficiency of the commissary's equipment and physical plant. Offers requiring electronic communication shall not be based on the use of DeCA Systems and should not interfere with DeCA systems including in-store wireless and ESL's. Offers of programs will not preclude DeCA from establishing any other additional in-store marketing/advertising program or prohibit the use of any other coupon dispensing methods in the commissaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;All offeror's programs must ensure compliance with all applicable governmental laws and regulations. Compliance with government IT security and PPI will be considered. Further, all offerors will ensure they have received all required authorization and consent from advertisers to use their intellectual property, including trademarks, logos, or copyright material in the offer(s). Offerors shall be responsible for and obtain as necessary, at their own expense, all necessary licenses and permits, and shall comply with all applicable federal or state laws, rules, and regulations. Programs may not include additions to existing commissary product category assortments nor alter the commissary self-service operational environment. All data produced and products resulting from any future agreement shall become the property of the government with unlimited rights. The government's intent is to receive technical offers and oral presentations only from prospective contractors capable of providing in-store programs. The government reserves the right to reject any offer they do not find to conform with the general requirement of this notice. Contractor(s) shall note that submission of technical offers does not guarantee further consideration of any offer.<br /><span style="mso-tab-count: 1"><br /></span>The Agency plans to evaluate each offer by reviewing its technical acceptability and any revenue potential. Further consideration will be given only to those proposals determined to provide best value to DeCA. Technical offers will not be returned to any offeror.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:     This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not intend to award a contract from this announcement or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, but is seeking information on available sources capable of providing a firefighting aircraft study resulting in a report identifying the appropriate number and types of aviation resources necessary to effectively meet future fire management needs. <br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture -Forest Service (USFS) has a multi-faceted mission that involves management of the National Forest System, cooperating with State and local agencies, and providing wildfire protection.  The aerial firefighting mission is extremely complex in terms of aircraft use, aircraft characteristics, bases, contracts, costs, dispatching, mission objectives, tactics, strategy and communications. The USFS contracts large fixed-wing aircraft configured with retardant delivery systems to drop retardant on wildfires.  These aircraft are commonly referred to as airtankers (Type 1 &gt;3000 gallons and Type 2 1800-2999 gallons).  The Forest Service also contracts heavy helicopters for water delivery to the fireline.  Fixed-wing water scooper aircraft have not been directly contracted to the USFS, but have been used through interagency contracts and agreements.  Under current practices, the USFS uses a broad range of tactical and strategic approaches with airtankers including direct and indirect attack under initial attack, extended attack and large fire support.
<p>A USFS-appointed Technical Team (USFS Team) consisting of fire operations specialist, fire scientists, an aviation specialist, and fire planners, will oversee this analysis, provide data and data access and provide subject matter expertise. A USFS Team Project Leader will be identified to the contractor upon contract award.</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:     The Forest Service Incident Support Branch is seeking small business vendors who can provide research and analysis to include <br />1) Review of the scientific literature and internal or contracted reports related to airtanker, helicopter and scooper use, aircraft characteristics, bases, contracts, costs, dispatching, mission objectives, tactics, strategy and communications which identify how the variety of aviation missions have been modeled in the past and a review of past studies to identify the primary factors that influence appropriate fleet composition.<br />2) Define the utility and operational parameters of large airtankers (LAT), heavy helicopters (defined as Type 1), and water scoopers in accomplishing the variety of aviation missions supporting wildfire management, including summary of the circumstances (fire management types; Type 5- Type 1, fire size, missions, basing, dispatching, geographic and logistical factors) under which each aircraft type can effectively operate. The data in the final report shall be documented by aircraft class (LAT, heavy helicopters and water scoopers) and aircraft type; and <br />3) Examine recent (CY 2000- CY 2011)aviation usage trends (including fire type/size) and explore how various combinations of new and existing aviation resources could meet capacity and demand levels projected from historical use. Access to the data will be provided by the FS immediately after contract award. This analysis shall identify the appropriate mix of airtankers (Type 1 and Type 2), heavy helicopters (Type 1) and water scoopers.</p>
<p>SUBMITTAL INFORMATION: Qualified Interested Offerors must respond to Kellen Logan, by Wednesday, February 15, 3:00 PM MST. via email: klogan@fs.fed.us. Questions should be submitted by email as well.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 541990 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and the small business size standard is $7.0 million in annual receipts.
<p><strong>Background:<br /><br /></strong>The Chernobyl Research Unit (CRU), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is responsible for a research program in radiation effects on cancer and other diseases. CRU develops, administers, and evaluates a contract-supported applied research program.</p>
<p>The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986 resulted in massive releases of radioactive materials into the atmosphere and contamination of large areas with significant levels of radioiodines (up to two months after the accident), radiocesiums and other radionuclides. Among the population groups affected by the accident, a larger number of individuals who were exposed to radioiodines as fetuses, children or adolescents present a special concern, as the young thyroids are known to be especially susceptible to the carcinogenic effect of radiation exposure.</p>
<p>The Belarus-American Study of Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Diseases Following the Chernobyl Accident (BelAm) is a part of NCI's Chernobyl research program. Belarus was chosen as a study site because it was considered to be one of the most contaminated areas by radioiodine fallout from the Chernobyl accident. The original BelAm cohort population consisted of persons who were children or adolescents at the time of the accident, who had thyroid activity measurements made within a short time following the accident on April 26, 1986, and who lived in specified affected areas.</p>
<p>There is special concern for cancer and other health risks associated with exposure to radiation during prenatal period (in-utero), as fetuses are considered especially vulnerable to radiation damage. Initial data from a parallel study suggested a high risk of thyroid cancer associated with prenatal (in-utero) exposure to radioactive iodine from the Chernobyl fallout. In 2011, NCI began collaboration with Belarusian investigators to assemble a new cohort study in Belarus of persons who were in-utero at the time of the accident to be added to the BelAm research program. Initial efforts are currently underway to construct this cohort and radiation doses.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:<br /><br /></strong>The purpose of this project is to provide support for detecting thyroid and other pathology in persons who have been exposed to radiation as released by the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station in April 26, 1986. The study deals with a recently assembled in-utero cohort which includes persons who were exposed to Chernobyl fallout radiation in-utero and early life and a main cohort which has been established and consists of subjects who were age 18 or under at the time of the accident, had their dose to the thyroid gland measured, and lived in the Chernobyl affected areas in Belarus.</p>
<p>Support will be provided by establishing and following up with the Belarusian in-utero cohort, following up and maintaining the main cohort, processing and managing data, and providing quality control.</p>
<p><strong>Project Requirements:<br /></strong><br />Major tasks of the Contractor include the following:<br /><br />1. Establishment and Follow-up of the in-utero cohort: (a) Locating and contacting in-utero cohort subjects and their mothers and conducting personal interviews with the mothers. (b) With input and guidance from the NCI, developing methods to calculate pre- and postnatal doses for all subjects of the in-utero cohort. (c) Preparing and providing an error-free, complete and up-to-date database of personal dosimetry interviews. (d) Identifying vital status and last known address of the in-utero cohort members and their mothers, and contacting them according to the procedures described in the study protocol. <br /><br />2. Maintenance of the main cohort: (a) Acquiring updated contact and medical diagnostic information using the Chernobyl State Registry. (b) Linking the main cohort with the National Belarusian Cancer Registry for each specific cancer site reported to the Registry beginning in 1987 and through the latest calendar year for which complete incidence data are available. <br /><br />3. Data Processing and Management: (a) Creating and maintaining a master database of the in-utero cohort that links to computerized databases of questionnaires, vital status, tracing history, and other study data, which are to be entered. (b) Delivering an accurate, complete and up-to-date electronic master database on demographic, medical, cancer incidence and other relevant information. (c) Updating the database for the main and in-utero cohort with information obtained as a result of record linkage to the State Chernobyl Registry and National Belarusian Cancer Registry.<br /><br />4. Quality Control and Reporting: (a) With input and guidance from NCI, developing and implementing procedures to assure the quality of data collected, entered and managed. (b) Maintaining comprehensive documentation for all study databases. (c) Collaborating with NCI in preparation of scientific papers to be published to peer-reviewed Western journals.</p>
<p><strong>Other Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<p>This work requires the contractor to have access to the cohort who experienced fallout from the Chernobyl accident. The Belarus government has mandated that all research related to the Chernobyl accident must go through the Republican Research Center of Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology, so the contractor must have the capability to get approval from this institution.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:<br /></strong><br />The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is one year, with two one-year options.</p>
<p><strong>Submission Information:</strong></p>
<p>To be deemed capable of providing the current need for the study, the offeror shall submit a written capability statement demonstrating the ability and experience in performing the requirements noted in this notice. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following criteria:<br /><br />1. The ability to acquire approval from the Republican Research Center of Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology. <br /><br />2. Experience and capabilities of personnel with managing the BelAm cohort study, database management, and dosimetry.<br /><br />3. Demonstrate proven organizational approach in managing cohort studies.</p>
<p>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above. Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of your capability statement, as well as the eligible small business concern's name, point of contact, address and DUNS number.</p>
<p>All capability statements sent in response to this SOURCES SOUGHT notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Jame Chang, Contract Specialist, at jame.chang@nih.gov in MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by February 8, 2012, 3:30PM, EST.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the name and telephone number for a point of contact) to the contract specialist listed in the announcement within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The United States Geological Survey, Columbia Environmental Research Center, Columbia, MO has a need for a state-of- the-art swim tunnel to analyze the impact of sublethal metals exposure on the swimming performance of endangered populations of white sturgeon. The CERC presently does not have the apparatus necessary for evaluating swimming performance of very small (less than 1 gram) fish subjected to flowing water.  The apparatus requires a water bath to maintain water temperature, as well as water pump having an output that can be controlled by a frequency converter in order to control the water speed. The apparatus shall meet the following requirements:

Vendor shall provide troubleshooting assistance by phone to USGS personnel. 
2.	Total water volume of the apparatus shall be 5 L the test section shall be 30.0x7.5x7.5 cm, range of water speed shall be 3 to 110 cm/second. Overall dimensions of the apparatus shall be 117 x 40 cm.
3.	Apparatus shall be constructed of anti-corrosive materials. The test section shall have a double lid for adding and removing fish. Adjustable baffles (vanes) for modifying flow profile in test section. Speed control with analog input/output, ports for oxygen and temperature probes.

Based on the information at this time, the government considers the supplies specified as a sole source from Qubit Systems, Inc., 700 Gardiners Road, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, K7M 3X9 and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
A. GENERAL INFORMATION
1.	Title of Project: Veterans Administration Analysis of Aerosol Data from Shands AGH Facility in Gainesville, Florida
2.	Scope of Work: The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to accomplish the deliverables described in this statement of work (SOW), except as may otherwise be specified. The purpose of this IAG is to analyze aerosol and related data collected during testing of a decommissioned hospital. The results of the analysis will assist VHA staff in understanding the potential effectiveness and practical implications of options for creating isolation surge capacity using HVAC controls.
3.	Background: The U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is interested in studying strategies to safely create negative pressure isolation space for surge capacity using engineering (HVAC) controls and in developing a better basis for hospital ventilation standards. One challenge is that the dispersion of infectious aerosols and, to a large extent, non-infectious respiratory aerosols is challenging (if not impossible) to study in an active hospital setting because of safety concerns. Air flow "standards" have been utilized by hospital engineers for decades to minimize the risk of airborne disease transmission. Despite established standards, there is little scientific data supporting these practices.
In this study, established standards were challenged using a recently decommissioned hospital in Gainesville, Florida, in which non-infectious aerosols (surrogates for infectious particulates) were studied under various environmental conditions and ventilation patterns. Multiple tests were conducted under a range of HVAC conditions. Data collected included particle counts, tracer gas concentrations, HVAC airflows and pressure differences between numerous building spaces.
4.	Performance Period: The contractor shall complete the work required under this SOW in 365 calendar days or less from date of award, unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer (CO). If the contractor proposes an earlier completion date, and the Government accepts the contractor's proposal, the contractor's proposed completion date shall prevail. The work shall begin within 30 calendar days of award, unless otherwise specified.

Notice Type:

Synopsis: 

This is a Sources Sought notice for small business general construction firms and market survey for Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for construction project identified below.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) is seeking a small business general construction firm to perform Project No. 663-406, correct seismic deficiencies at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle Division, 1660 South Columbian Way, Seattle, WA 98108.  The general construction firm must be classified under one or more of the following small business programs: (1) Service-Disabled Veterans-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) (2), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), (3) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), (4) Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), (5) Section 8(a), and/or (6) HUBZone.  The magnitude of this construction project is between $20,000,000 and $50,000,000.  Interested general construction firms must be firms with an approved NAICS Code 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.   A bid bond as well as payment and performance bonds shall be required. 

This project consists of seismically strengthening Building 100 at the VA Seattle Campus.  Specifically, this project will replace all braced frame members in Building 100, Nursing    Tower (NT) and Community Living Center, with buckling restrained braces in addition to bracing Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing systems as required in the building's interstitial spaces.

At eight stories tall, Building 100 NT and CLC were built in 1985 and serve as the inpatient wards in the main hospital.  The Seattle campus is the VA tertiary referral center for Veterans living in Alaska, Idaho and Washington.  Over 90 percent of all patient activity at this facility goes through Bldg 100 in any given day, so this project will resolve a critical patient safety issue.  Four sections of Bldg 100 have been identified by the VA for seismic renovation.  As a major tertiary inpatient facility, Building 100 NT ranks 10th and Bldg 100 NHCU ranks 19th on the list of Exceptionally High Risk (EHR) Buildings in the VA Seismic Inventory report.  

At this time, no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a solicitation. Bondable small business contractors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought.  

Responses should include the following information: 1. Company Name, 2. Address, 3. Point of Contact, 4. Phone number and e-mail address, 5. Business size determination and qualifying Small Business status, 6. DUNS number, 7. Available Bonding Capacity, 8. Construction experience of similar size and complexity. The estimated price range for this project is between $20,000,000 and $50,000,000. Please provide your email responses to ronald.ferrer@va.gov by 2:00 p.m. (PDT) on February 10, 2012.

Small business concerns failing to respond to this ad will not be precluded from responding to the solicitation. 

NOTE: This is not a Request for Proposal and the Government is seeking information for market research purposes only. The Government may or may not issue solicitation documents for this project.

Note: If this project is solicited as "full and open competition", in order to mitigate adverse effects to the small business community, prospective large prime contractors will be required to submit a small business sub-contracting plan as part of their bids. The ability to meet and exceed small business goals will be incorporated into the source selection criteria.  In addition, prospective large prime contractors will be encouraged to enter into small business teaming agreements. 

Project Labor Agreement Questionnaire:  A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 22.503 Policy states: (a) PLAs are a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement.  Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects; (b) an agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will - (1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and (2) Be consistent with law. 

PLA Q	UESTIONNAIRE (Please respond to the questions below)

1.	 What is your company's history with Project Labor Agreements (PLA) and its use on construction projects?


2.	Would your company likely submit a proposal for the VA construction solicitation that requires the use of a PLA?


3.	If VA requires a PLA, what would likely be the impact on construction cost for this project?

4.	Would the requirement to use PLA on a construction project restrict competition?


5.	Do you expect subcontractor resistance should VA require the use of a PLA on this construction project?


6.	Do you have additional comments regarding the use of a PLA for this project?

<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Fort Sill Contracting Office's intent to award a follow on contract for the AIT (13 Series) Instructors for the period of performance beginning 20 March 2012 - 19 March 2013.  Two sole source 8a contracts were awarded 18 March 2011 and 1 April 2011 to Principal Technologies, 525 Central Park Dr, Ste 400, Oklahoma City, OK, 73105.  The follow on contract will be performed under the same terms and conditions of the two existing contracts, W9124L-11-C-0002 and W9124L-11-C-0006, which were awarded under the 8a Program.  This will be an 8a sole source procurement. The follow on contract will be issued to the current contractor, Principal Technologies, 525 Central Park Dr, Ste 400, Oklahoma City, OK, 73105.  The contract type is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  This follow on contract will provide critical services to the USAFCOEFS until a competitive multiple-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Task Order can be awarded on one of the newly established Fires Center of Excellence's (FCoE) multiple-award ID/IQ contracts.  This action is accomplished under authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement requires mandatory instructor certifications to be held prior to teaching this course.  Certifications normally take up to 120 days to obtain for these positions. Due to time constraints there is not enough time to provide Fair Opportunity to the FCoE contractors per guidance in following the task order competitive procedures which would allow a new contractor a phase-in period for non-certified instructors to obtain certification.  Award to any other source would result in a lapse in service which would result in mission failure. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and is posted for five (5) calendar days.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this twelve month period would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract is based on this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code remains 611430.   Any comments or questions to this notice, or detailed capabilities must be emailed to Patricia M. Dominguez:  patricia.m.dominguez2.civ@mail.mil or Debra K. Seals: debra.k.seals.civ@mail.mil, at the Mission Installation Contracting Command, Fort Sill.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Philips Research North America 345 Scarborough Road Briarcliff Manor, NY 10510. The National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland requires The Thermal Imaging Probe System (Philips) will be used to develop minimally invasive gene delivery to rodent brain.   The system available from Philips is the only pre-clincal "turn key" system for using high frequency ultrasound to delivery drugs/genes to tissue.  The only other option is to build our own system and we do not have this expertise. In addition, this system has been used by our extramural collaborators (Mark Borden, CU Bolder) who will help us develop the technology here at NIDA.
The Thermal Imaging Probe System is only available from Philips. There is not another system available that would have similar functionality without building our own and ordering components.  No substitutions are possible.  Since, this system is already used within in the labs it is advantageous to continue using the same equipment since all end users are familiar with the machine. To introduce new equipment there would have to be new training and additional cost to get accustom with a new piece of equipment. Mark Borden as stated previously has expertise advice in this equipment and training. 


The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>--Intent to Sole Source to Canberra Industries for Lynx MCA Units

<a href="mailto:Fisher.Trina@epa.gov">Fisher, Trina</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Canberra Industries, Inc., for purchase of five (5) Lynx-Digital Signal Analyzers and three (3) Lynx-19? Rack Mount Kits.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Currently, all instrumentation software utilized in the Las Vegas laboratory is developed and maintained by Canberra Industries. Multichannel Analyzer (MCA) units are specific to vendor software out-of-the-box. Using a different vendor?s MCA hardware would require new software to be purchased, installed and maintained separately. Training would also be required at a significant additional cost both in real dollars and in personnel hours. Per the Canberra Site-Wide Service Agreement #1343, any additional equipment purchased from Canberra is covered under the agreement for on-site repair and maintenance which is an additional cost savings.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 1 calendar day of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete  the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Trina Fisher via email to Fisher.Trina@epa.gov no later than 3:00 pm EST 1 calendar day after the date of this announcement. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>The Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements, (PLAs), for a large scale construction contract, (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:  <br>Fort Bliss Hospital Replacement Project<br>Fort Bliss, TX 79906<br><br>Project Description:  Construct a new 1,132,237 SF Medical Facility to replace the existing Williams Beaumont Army Medical Center at Fort Bliss, Texas.  The facility will consist of main hospital, in-patient and out-patient clinics, administrative building, clinical investigation building, and central utility plant. Project Number 72481  The project will be designed in accordance with criteria prescribed in Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-510-01, (MIL-HDBK-1191),  DoD  Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings UFC 4-010-01, Americans with Disabilities Act and Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADA/ABAAG), and applicable energy conservation legislation.  Air conditioning: (estimated 4,550 tons).   <br>Range of Magnitude:  Over $500 Million.  <br>Period of Performance:  three years after date of award, estimated.    <br><br>PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<br>Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy Subpart 22.503:<br>a.)	Project Labor Agreement, (PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.<br>b.)	An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:<br>1.)	Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and...<br>2.)	Be consistent with law.<br><br>Some of the factors that maybe considered regarding their use are:<br>a.)	The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br>b.)	The complexity of the project.<br>c.)	Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br>d.)	Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br>e.)	The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br>f.)	The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br>g.)	The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br>h.)	Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.<br><br>Please reference FAR Provision: 52.222-33 "Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement" and FAR Clause: 52.222-34 "Project Labor Agreements."<br>In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLA's. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br>a.)	Should PLA's be executed on this selected large dollar contract at El Paso/Fort Bliss, Texas? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?<br>b.)	Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br>c.)	Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<br>d.)	Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts?<br>e.)	Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade? <br>f.)	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.<br>g.)	Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br>h.)	Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the El Paso/Fort Bliss, Texas area?<br>i.)	Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential offerors and/or subcontractors to meet their Small Business utilization goals?<br> <br>Note:  For yes or no answers, please provide supporting narrative.<br><br>Please provide your comments via email ONLY to: james.bales@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 6 February 2012.<br>Agency/Contracting Office:  <br>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District<br>ATTN: CESWF-CT (Room 2A19)<br>819 Taylor Street<br>Fort Worth, Texas  76102-0300<br>

<a href="mailto:tonya.braileyjordan1@us.army.mil">USACE HEC, Ft. Belvoir</a>
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a Sole source Firm Fixed Price Contract with The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) for the purposes of executing the Nepal GIS Integration project on behalf of the U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), Office of Defense Cooperation (U.S. Embassy - Kathmandu), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Nepal Ministry of Home Affairs. This procurement is for a unique service based upon the unique capability of the cooperative partners work together and leverage limited resources.  An announcement will be made in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) and the competition advocate will be advised as to the results. Nepal is a region at risk from major earthquake events. As a result of the seismicity of the region, earthquakes are frequent; due to poorly constructed buildings and roads these events have been devastating to its population. Major earthquakes causing catastrophic damage have occurred in 1934 and 1988. Located in a mountainous and remote region, Nepal's urban population represents about 14 percent of the total population and is primarily located in Katmandu. In the Katmandu Valley, the population (approximately 2.5 million based on the 2001 census) inhabits poorly constructed buildings on a former lake<br>bed, which can amplify the ground shaking during an earthquake. Also, unregulated urban development has resulted in existing farmland being replaced with poorly constructed single and multistory buildings. Katmandu has only one airport and three roads connecting it to the outside world which, in all likelihood, would be made impassible by a major earthquake event. Katmandu has been identified as the highest risk for earthquake fatalities when compared to other<br>cities in the world. Its quality of building construction has been compared with<br>that of Haiti.<br><br>A broad range of international organizations and donors are currently identifying and funding disaster preparedness programs in Nepal with little coordination of effort. With a focus on applying geospatial information to support effective decision making, synchronizing the access to and development of GIS resources will help the Government of Nepal and the international community make well informed decisions on prioritization and allocation of resources for disaster risk reduction projects.<br><br>b.  Objectives of this Contract.  The objective of the Nepal GIS Integration project is to improve disaster planning, preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery in Nepal.  This project will identify and collaboratively engage existing capabilities and resources enhancing the development and use of geospatial data, value-added information products and GIS-based tools addressing the potential impact of major regional earthquake events.  Geospatial information capacity is composed of systems of hardware, software, data, processes, people, organizations, and institutional arrangements for collecting, storing, analyzing, and disseminating geospatial information about areas of the Earth.  Its use before, during, and after an emergency can greatly enhance an end-users' ability to make accurate, efficient, and effective decisions.  Using a collaborative approach, the project will access and apply this capacity supporting the decision-making process related to regional disaster resilience and preparedness.<br>Tasks: The project is composed of three tasks described below. <br>3.1 	Task 1 - Assessment<br>An assessment of current geospatial resources and how they may be used to support emergency management will be conducted. An analysis of existing/emerging information requirements addressing disaster planning, preparedness and response will be completed and a gap assessment will be produced.<br>		3.1.1	Geospatial Resource Assessment<br>In collaboration with national, regional and international organizations this activity will identify existing relevant GIS capabilities and associated information repositories.  This task will inventory and assess agency requirements and current applications associated with geospatial information, currently available GIS resources (i.e., existing data/information resources, hardware, software, training programs, tools, etc.) and characterize these resources in terms of information quality, completeness, validity, relevance, accessibility and required skills to develop and apply these resources.<br>		3.1.2	Requirements Analysis & Gap Assessment<br>This activity will identify gaps in the existing GIS resources, capabilities, access, and use based on the information gathered in the resource assessment.<br>				Deliverables:<br> 	Resource Assessment & Gap Analysis Report<br>This task will be performed 60% by PDC technical GIS specialists, 25% by ICIMOD technical GIS specialists, and 15% by USACE technical GIS specialists.  After the data is gathered per Section 3.1.1, PDC will lead a reporting effort to identify geospatial resource and procedural gaps. 3.2	Task 2 - Pilot Capability Integration<br>Task 2 will use the assessment conducted in Task 1 to identify the most effective means of filling the gaps in GIS resources and information sharing.  This task will engage key organizations providing GIS capabilities for disaster preparedness in Nepal and will generate recommendations on a way forward in the enhancement of regional GIS capabilities.  These recommendations will be presented to the Government of Nepal. <br><br>		3.2.1	Integrated GIS Capability & Operational Concept<br>A pilot capability will be specified and limited integration of a GIS resource to address Katmandu earthquake risk and vulnerability will be completed. Capability integration will not be limited to only hardware, software, people, and databases, but will also address procedures and guidelines that standardize and facilitate information sharing between organizations. <br><br>This task will be performed 40% by PDC technical GIS specialists, 40% by ICIMOD technical GIS specialists, and 20% by USACE technical GIS specialists.  Both ICIMOD's Kathmandu Valley Earthquake GIS tool and PDC's Disaster Aware GIS tool will be evaluated as pilot capabilities.  One or the other, or a combination of the two, will be chosen to complete the requirements in Section 3.2.2.  USACE will support PDC and ICIMOD in defining the integrated GIS capability and operational concept. <br><br>		3.2.2	Pilot GIS Resource<br>A pilot capability, based on existing GIS and associated data/information repositories will be established.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Wage Determination 2005-2317, Rev 11, dated 6/13/2011 applies to this acquisition and is available by full text at </span><a href="http://www.wdol.gov/"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">www.wdol.gov</span></a></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'"><br /><strong>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.wawftraining.com/">www.wawftraining.com</a></span>. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Central Registration database </span>and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.wawftraining.com </span>is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: </span></p>

<DESC>The contractor shall provide all labor, parts and other items necessary to repair a Striker Fire Truck 06L00340 (Infared Camera). The camera was damaged when a garage door fell on it during a tornado. The camera is damaged both externally and internally. The camera will be shipped to the contractor and the contractor is responsible for return shipping after repairs are complete. This is an airplane camera made by L-3 Communications Electro-Optical Systems altered to work on Crash-Rescue fire trucks. The interface program for the camera is the proprietary property of L-3 and Crash-Rescue. The picture below is the camera installed on the fire truck snozzle. The snozzle is designed to punch a hole in the aircraft skin and allow the operator to see inside the aircraft on a monitor in the fire truck which is interfaced through the camera.

<DESC>PART I-SECTION C&nbsp;&nbsp; (See Section C of Solicitation for complete details)<br />DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT
<p>C.1 PREFACE TO DESCRIPTION, SPECIFICATIONS, AND WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p>C.1.1 Background<br />As mandated by Public Law 89-522 dated July 30, 1966, The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH), Library of Congress (LOC), provides reading materials in recorded and braille formats to U.S. residents and U.S. citizens living abroad who are unable to use conventional print materials because of visual and physical limitations. Each year, more than 24 million books and magazines are circulated to these groups. Reading materials (books and magazines) are produced by contractors for NLS/BPH, and are distributed to a readership in excess of 500,000 through a network of 132 regional and sub-regional libraries for blind and physically handicapped individuals. States, municipalities, or other agencies operate these organizations. In addition, books are distributed to schools, multi-state centers, and veterans' hospitals throughout the nation and U.S. territories. All services and products are funded by the U.S. Congress through NLS/BPH and are provided to patrons free of charge including mail to and from patrons through the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
<p>NLS/BPH has about 130,000 titles in its collection and adds 2,700 titles (including music titles) annually. Books are circulated to patrons primarily through the mail from their network libraries located in their jurisdictions. Additionally, several magazines are distributed on a weekly, monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly schedule. Also, catalogs, bibliographies, and newsletters are typically distributed on an annual, quarterly or bi-monthly schedule.</p>
<p>C.1.2 User Materials<br />Contractors who produce books, equipment, or other products shall be cognizant of the consumer-responsive nature of the program and that the specifications for these products have been developed to meet the needs of program users. Materials are produced with the readers' needs foremost in mind and improved through constant monitoring and consumer input. Contractors are expected to familiarize themselves with the equipment-handling practices of blind and physically handicapped clientele and ensure that the supplies and equipment produced shall stand up under such use. A high degree of quality workmanship and product reliability is mandated by the product specification.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>1.1	PROJECT OVERVIEW<br><br>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Philadelphia District, has been tasked with providing support to U.S. Environmental Agency (USEPA) Region 2 during on-site remediation activity at the Lipari Landfill Superfund Site (Lipari) located on Route 322 in Mantua Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey.  Included in the remedial activities at the Lipari site is a slurry wall surrounding a major portion of the landfill, as well as a soil vapor extraction (SVE) system to collect landfill gas.  <br><br>USACE Philadelphia District is in the process of expanding a portion of the slurry wall to encompass additional landfill materials that are presently outside of the slurry wall.  As part of this construction work, USACE will need to perform borings and install additional SVE wells and monitor wells at Lipari.  The location of the site is shown on Figure 1.  <br><br>This work will require the services of a drilling Contractor to drill borings, collect continuous core barrel soil samples using sonic drilling techniques, and install wells.  The drilling Contractor is required to perform all work in accordance with the procedures and schedules approved by the government.  All pilot borings and well installation, as well as all other work items in this contract shall be performed in accordance with all local, State/NJDEP, and Federal regulations and guidance.<br><br>The Contractor shall provide qualified personnel to complete the following major work items under the base contract:<br><br> 	Install 7 soil vapor extraction wells<br> 	Install 2 single cased monitor wells<br><br><br>Three options are also included in this contract.  These options, if exercised, would require the Contractor to complete the following major work items:<br><br> 	Option A - Install 2 single cased monitor wells<br> 	Option B - Install 1 double cased monitor well<br> 	Option C - Install 1 additional double cased monitor well<br><br>The work under this contract consists of furnishing all plant, labor, materials, supplies, and accessories required to accomplish the pilot borings, obtain the required soil samples and install the monitoring wells, together with all other operations incidental to the work, which shall be performed in strict accordance with these specifications and the applicable plans and drawings, subject to the terms and conditions of the contract.  The drillers shall have a copy of these specifications with them on the site at all times and shall be familiar with the applicable provisions of the specifications governing the contract work.<br><br>Drilling and installation of all wells in this contract (7 SVE wells and up to 6 monitor wells) will be performed using sonic drilling techniques with soil samples collected directly from the sonic casing during drilling.  <br><br>Soil core barrel samples will be collected continuously in all borings for both SVE wells and monitor wells and the recovered soil samples will be transferred directly to USACE representatives for identification and processing. The soil samples obtained from the sonic borings will be produced by the driller in polyethylene tubes and properly sealed and labeled before transfer to the on-site USACE representative.  These soil core samples will be used to determine the type, nature, and characteristics of the subsurface materials encountered and the extent and conditions of the various materials as they exist to the depths and at the locations specified.  <br><br>Cuttings from the borings and well installations shall be placed in 55-gallon drums provided by the drilling Contractor and sealed with secure lids overnight and when not in use.  The drums will be transported by the Contractor to a designated rolloff container within the landfill site for subsequent disposal.<br>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2). No Request for Proposal (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement will be made. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Research and Development Center (RDC) will not issue paper copies of this announcement.
<p>As the multi-year ice within the Polar Regions recedes, the Coast Guard (CG) is preparing for the possibility of increased operations within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) north of Alaska. It is anticipated that these operations, in the Arctic environment, will fall within nine of the 11 statutory CG missions. The nine are; Aids to Navigation, Defense Readiness, Ice Operations, Living Marine Resources, Marine Environmental Protection, Marine Safety, Other Law Enforcement, Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security, and Search and Rescue. A general description of the missions can be found at http://www.uscg.mil/top/missions/ . Counter-Drug Interdiction and Alien Migrant Interdiction operations are currently not included. In the non-Polar regions, these same nine missions are typically accomplished by Coast Guard's boat stations and Coast Guard boat crews operating the Response Boat Medium (RB-M).</p>
<p>To accomplish the nine missions in the Arctic, the CG Arctic Craft will need to have certain capabilities uniquely suitable for this challenging environment because the operational environment of the north slope of Alaska is significantly different from the non-Polar environments where the Coast Guard boat crews currently operate. Differences include the varying ice conditions encountered, extreme cold, a silted ocean floor, high waves that build quickly, and a lack of any infrastructure to support operations. Current Coast Guard boats, such as the RB-M, have not been specifically designed for these conditions. The RB-M is an aluminum, self-righting, high-speed, multi-mission capable boat, operable from non-Polar shore stations. In addition, there are a number of logistical issues unique to the Arctic. For example, all equipment used by the Coast Guard is transported by C-130 aircraft due to lack of transportation infrastructure. In addition, Arctic Areas of Responsibility (AORs) are typically located in geographic areas that are so remote that traditional maintenance on the craft may not always be accomplished at the recommended intervals. This can be caused by lack of equipment, lack of a maintenance facility, limited supplies and other logistical hurdles.</p>
<p>Currently the Coast Guard is conducting research to identify Arctic Craft that are fully capable of performing similar functions to those that are traditionally preformed by RB-M type craft, which are able to respond rapidly to Coast Guard missions, or conduct planned patrols and training in non-Polar CG AORs. Some of these functions include: search and rescue, recovery of persons from the water, transfer of persons and equipment from boat to boat, towing of disabled craft, transfer of persons to and from CG helicopters, medical assistance, fire fighting and rescue assistance, recreational boat safety, marine environmental protection, enforcement of laws and treaties, port security and safety, and defense operations and contingency preparedness. The difference would be to perform these similar functions while operating in the Arctic's shallow waters and among ice floes while insulating the crew from the inherent cold weather environment. Further, the Craft needs to be able to accomplish the missions while operating in the north and northwest Alaska coastal areas where the maritime infrastructure lacks developed boat ramps and piers.</p>
<p>Construction of such ramps and piers is impractical due to the extreme environmental conditions and constant movement of silt and ice along the coast. Boats used in this region are primarily launched directly from the shore. The waters along the North Slope are shallow near the beach and remain shallow for a considerable distance off shore. To further exacerbate this problem, the seafloor is comprised of very fine silt particles that are easily taken into mechanical systems operating in the waters. Finally, the strong winds and unimpeded fetch result in significant wave height. It is anticipated that the CG will not attempt to build infrastructure in the near future. Therefore the CG is looking for Arctic craft that can overcome these operational and logistical obstacles.</p>
<p>Because of the multi-mission nature of the CG and it operations, craft that can perform a significant number of the nine statutory CG missions anticipated in the Arctic are of the most interest. At this time the CG does not have craft capable of efficiently and effectively supporting multiple operations in the Arctic environment on a level equivalent to that of the RB-M in other AORs. It is highly unlikely that there is one craft that will effectively support all CG mission requirements anywhere let alone the extreme environment of the Alaskan Northern Slope. Under this BAA, the Coast Guard is seeking to demonstrate innovative craft that have the best combination of capabilities to accomplish the broadest range of CG mission objectives in the Arctic Environment.</p>

<DESC>The following clauses were hereby incorporated into solicitation FA8122-11-R-0031 as follows:<br /><br />LPTA SECTION L CLAUSE<br />1.0 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS (ITO) AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSAL PREPARATION<br />USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES<br /><br />This section provides general guidance for preparing proposals.<br />2.0 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS<br />(a) The offeror's proposal must include all data and information requested by this ITO and must be submitted in accordance with these instructions. The offeror shall be compliant with the requirements as stated in the solicitation and qualification requirements. Non-conformance with the instructions<br />provided in this ITO may result in an unfavorable proposal evaluation.<br />(b) The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the offeror&nbsp; intends to meet these requirements. Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities and experience and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the offeror's proposal. <br />(c) Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed art work, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired.<br />(d) The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims.<br />(e) On page 1 of the solicitation, the proposal acceptance period is specified. Unless otherwise stated, e.g. 90 days, the offeror shall make a clear statement in Section A (page 1) or within its proposal documentation that it agrees to hold its offered prices firm 120 days after the proposal's due date.<br />(f) In accordance with FAR 4.8, the Government will retain one copy of all unsuccessful proposals. Unless directed otherwise by the offeror, the Government will destroy all extra copies.<br />(g) The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no<br />additional data will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit cost data to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.<br /><br />2.1 GENERAL INFORMATION<br /><br />2.1.1. Point of Contact<br />Request for Proposal FA8122-11-R-0032<br />The Contracting Officer (CO) and/or his Contract Specialist are the sole points of contact for this acquisition. Address any questions or concerns you may have to the CO's Contract Specialist, Ms. Danah Ambrose. Written requests for clarification may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at Danah.ambrose@tinker.af.mil or by phone (405) 734-4633.<br /><br />2.1.2 Completion Blocks/Sections<br />(a) Complete blocks 17a, and 30a., b. and c. of the RFP Section A, of the SF1449. In doing so, the offeror accedes to the contract terms and conditions as written in the RFP Sections. These sections constitute the model contract.<br />(b) Insert proposed unit and extended prices in the Basic Year Period for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN), including all option periods. The extended amount must equal the whole dollar unit price multiplied by the number of units.<br />(c) Complete the necessary fill-ins and certifications Sections. The Representations, Instructions; Section L, and Evaluation; Section M shall be removed from any resultant award and shall remain in the<br />official contract file. For all other sections within the solicitation, the offeror shall submit only those section pages that require being filled-in.<br /><br />2.1.3. Debriefings<br />The CO will promptly notify offerors of any decision to exclude them from the competitive range; whereupon, they may request and receive a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505. Offerors excluded from the competitive range may request a pre-award debriefing or they may choose to wait until<br />after the source selection decision to request a post-award debriefing. However, offerors excluded from the competitive range shall be entitled to no more than one debriefing for each proposal. The CO will notify unsuccessful offerors in the competitive range of the source selection decision in accordance with FAR 15.506. Upon such notification, unsuccessful offerors may request and receive a debriefing. Offerors desiring a debriefing must make their request in accordance with the requirements of FAR 15.505 or 15.506, as applicable.<br /><br />2.1.4. Discrepancies<br />If an offeror believes that the requirements in these instructions contain an error, omission, or are otherwise unsound, the offeror shall immediately notify the CO in writing with supporting rationale as well as the remedies the offeror is asking the CO to consider as related to the omission or error. The offeror is<br />reminded that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussion. This reservation includes matters of additional or substitute pages of the initial proposal.<br /><br />2.1.5. Electronic Reference Documents<br />All referenced documents for this solicitation are available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Potential offerors are encouraged to subscribe for real-time e-mail notifications when information has b een posted to the website for this solicitation.<br /><br />LPTA SECTION M CLAUSE<br />EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY<br />ACCEPTABLE PROCEDURES<br />(IAW FAR 13.106-2(b), 14.201-5(c), and 15.204-5(c))<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.101-2. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost/price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with<br />the FAR and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. <br /><br />The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. <br /><br />Request for Proposal FA8122-11-R-0032<br /><br />Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government intends to select one contractor for the program. However, the Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts for reduced quantities or no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.<br /><br />For the purpose of this award, offers will be evaluated for acceptability of evaluation factors described below:<br /><br />FACTOR 1: Technical<br />FACTOR 2: Cost/Price<br />Order of Importance: Factors 1 and 2 are of equal importance.<br /><br />Evaluation Methodology<br />Offers will be listed from lowest to highest price. After price is evaluated the technical acceptability evaluation will begin; starting with the lowest evaluated priced offeror. The first proposal evaluated as technically acceptable will be considered the best value proposal and all other technical evaluations will<br />cease.<br /><br />Cost/Price Factor<br />The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by multiplying the proposed unit price by the total quantity. Unrealistically low proposed prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.<br /><br />Technical Factor<br />The technical proposal will be evaluated for compliance with the solicitation requirements and/or any referenced specifications, engineering notes and all other attachments herein.<br />A proposal will be determined acceptable if the proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance or unacceptable if the proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not eligible for award

Pursuant to the Trade Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 2512(a)) (TAA), Federal acquisitions of supplies may be made only from offerors that will supply products of an eligible country under any of the free trade agreements entered into pursuant to the TAA. An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been ?substantially transformed? in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered ?substantially transformed? based solely on its integration into IT or other systems. FAR 25.003 defines WTO GPA qualifying countries as: Aruba, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea (Republic of), Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, or United Kingdom. See FAR clauses listed above for full country details and restrictions. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acquisition.gov/far/<BR><BR>(a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities under the Export Administration Act:
(1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli concern, or with any national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country;
(2) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to employ or otherwise discriminating against any person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such person;
(3) Furnishing information with respect to the race, religion, or national origin of any U.S. person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such U.S. person;
(4) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or proposes to have any business relationship (including a relationship by way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) with or in the State of Israel, with any business concern organized under the laws of the State of Israel, with any Israeli national or resident, or with any person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in Israel;
(5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports the State of Israel; and,
(6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing business with the State of Israel.
(b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden ?compliance with the boycott?, and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)?s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) above:<BR><BR>(1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:
(i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,
(ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment;
(2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;
(3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;
(4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;
(5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individual?s family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and,
(6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.<BR><BR>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision:
?Foreign person? means any person other than a United States person as defined below.
?United States person? means any United States resident or national (other than an individual resident outside the United States and employed by other than a United States person), any domestic concern (including any permanent domestic establishment of any foreign concern), and any foreign subsidiary or affiliate (including any permanent foreign establishment) of any domestic concern which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern, as provided under the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended.
(b) Certification. By submitting this offer, the offeror certifies that it is not:
(1) Taking or knowingly agreeing to take any action, with respect to the boycott of Israel by Arab League countries, which Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)) prohibits a United States person from taking; or,
(2) Discriminating in the award of subcontracts on the basis of religion.<BR><BR>1)     Partial shipments are not authorized
2)     Advance payments are not authorized<BR><BR>

<p>The SIP is a temporary, air supported, fabric membrane structure that will provide new event space in the courtyard of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (HMSG). The structure is to be erected once a year, either in spring or fall, allowing the museum to program its courtyard and thus optimize its footprint. The covered 12,812 square feet of sheltered space accommodates up to approximately 852 people for public events including performing arts, film, lectures, and debates.</p>
<p>The space is enclosed by an air supported, cable stayed, translucent, single layer membrane of high performance fabric. The main volume, of the enclosure, referred to as "the Body," rises through the void of the existing building and projects above the Hirshhorn approximately 20 meters (70 feet) and is referred to as "the Head." An extension of the Body, referred to as "the Connector" and "the X-Space," reaches across the plaza, compressed beneath the mass of the existing museum.</p>
<p>The services for this project will include, but are not limited to, general construction services, preparing construction documents, and serving as the Architect/Engineer of record for the project. It shall be the responsibility of the Offeror to design and construct this project under SI's design and construction excellence guidelines and complete construction while meeting all the specified project requirements within budget.</p>

<p>Services will also include, in addition to the initial installation of the Pavilion, maintenance of the structure for a period of two months, de-installation, storage, and annual re-installation, maintenance, de-installation, and storage for a period of four additional years/cycles following the first.</p>
<p>Smithsonian Institution has estimated the total budget for this project, including, all design requirements, construction, installation, maintenance, deinstallation, transportation, storage and all related services from the Base Contract through Option 1 to be between $10 million and $12 million. The Smithsonian Institution will hold the Contractor responsible for performing within this budget.</p>
<p>The total period of performance allowed for this project shall be based on the completion of design and construction and delivery of the SIP to HMSG and SI on or before August 30, 2013.

The main volume, of the enclosure, referred to as "the Body," rises through the void of the existing building and projects above the Hirshhorn approximately 20 meters (70 feet) and is referred to as "the Head." An extension of the Body, referred to as "the Connector" and "the X-Space," reaches across the plaza, compressed beneath the mass of the existing museum.</p>

<p>All questions regarding this notice are to be submitted in writing via E-mail or Fax. All questions submitted to this office are subject to be posted in this notice along with the appropriate response(s). Vendor identities will not be disclosed.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Q&amp;A</p>
<p>1. It appears that this is a one-time "Urgent" requirement for a total of 48 gearboxes, is that correct?</p>
<p>A) FA8118-12-Q-0008 was issued as an urgent, fixed quantity Request for Quote (RFQ). Specific work requirements and quantities can be found in the RFQ and attachments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Is there a possibility for more of the same [gearboxes], or will Alabama Aircraft Industries continue to overhaul these gearboxes under contract FA8118-10-D-0043?</p>
<p>A)&nbsp;Contract FA8118-10-D-0043 has expired. The Government is currently researching the possibility of soliciting another requirements type&nbsp;effort for the remanufacture of these gearboxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The DFARS indicates a ninth position of "Q" in the procurement instrument identification # is for "RFQ--Manual" as opposed to what I normally see as a "R." What's the difference between "R" &amp; "Q" identifiers, and what does the suffix "Manual" indicate?</p>
<p>A) The procurement instrument identification number (PIIN) for the current action is FA8118-12-Q-0008. The PIIN is also commonly referred to as the solicitation number before award and then the contract number after award. The ninth position of the PIIN in this instance is "Q" (the dashes are not counted as positions).</p>
<p>As shown in DFARS 204.7003, A "Q" indicates that the document is a Request for Quote (RFQ) and a "R" indicates that the document is a Request for Proposal (RFP). The main determining factor of whether the solicitation is a RFP or RFQ is the specific part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) utilized in the acquisition. RFQs are used when utilizing FAR part 13, Simplified Acquisition. RFPs are used for negotiated acquisitions, FAR part 15.</p>
<p>The automatic or manual suffix indicates whether the specific PIIN is an agency generated form (automatic) or a standard form such as the SF18 (manual).</p>
<p>For the current acquisition, the Government will be using procedures in FAR Part 13, as supplemented. Therefore, a RFQ was issued.</p>

<DESC>*The purpose of this amendment is to provide situational awareness to industry in regards to the SCAD follow-on.&nbsp; This is purely informational and there is no request for additional information.&nbsp; The original sources sought synopsis closed in Jan 2011 and remains closed.&nbsp; The Government continues market research and acquisition planning activities.&nbsp; If this requirement does materialize and a decision is made to go open market, we estimate&nbsp;the synopsis followed by the solicitation to be&nbsp;released&nbsp;in 4th Qtr FY12 or 1st Qtr FY13.&nbsp; Please continue to monitor FBO.gov for any updates.*<br /><br />The Space Superiority Systems Directorate (SY) is seeking interested contractors to provide services for the Space Control Architecture Development (SCAD) follow-on effort to ensure continuity of service for architecting analysis. The Government intends to use the responses to this synopsis to assess market conditions. Pertinent NAICS Code is 541712 with size standard of 500.
<p>This contract will support the analysis of systems, capabilities, and concepts within the space control mission areas of offensive space control (OSC), defensive space control (DSC), space situational awareness (SSA) and space command and control (C2). In addition to program support via papers and studies, ongoing architecture support includes development, coding, and integration of various commercial and non-commercial software models and applications to provide assessments of potential space control capabilities and their relative operational impacts. The contract will support a comparison of technical requirements of existing and proposed programs within the Space Control mission area against pertinent state-of-the-art capabilities of industry, government, and academia. The contract will facilitate the creation of technology investment roadmaps to ensure critical technologies and technical shortfalls are identified and addressed. These requirements may be met through deliverable products and contractor support over the course of five years (one base year and four option years) with approximately 85,000 hours of effort over each year.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to use specialized government furnished software models to perform analysis and solve architecting problems. The software tools use Excel, Matlab, and STK as an architecture backbone. The successful contractor must be able to utilize the software, if selected, from the first day of contract performance. The successful contractor may need to develop additional analytic tools as mission areas become more mature. The Government may require the delivery of the source code and documentation for any contractor developed analytic tools used in this effort for future government use.</p>
<p>In performing the SCAD contract, the successful contractor will conduct studies, analyses, and make recommendations for the future make up of SYSW OSC, DSC, C2, and SSA systems. As a result, the successful contractor may have "unequal access to information" while performing this contract. The contractor shall not provide systems engineering in support of another contractor serving in a prime contractor development role for any current or future system. The contractor shall not evaluate itself in any source selection or evaluate any products delivered under other contracts. As a result of the "unequal access to information", the contractor, subcontractors and individuals supporting the SCAD effort will be subject to restrictions for future SMC/SY development and certain support contracts and will have an Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest (OCI) mitigation plan detailing organizational and individual personnel concerns when appropriate.<br /><br />All interested parties may submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) containing the following information: executive summary, technical description of the offeror's experience and knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), cost estimation, and architecture; description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort; contact vehicle recommendations; and proof of security clearances. Interested parties should have experience in the analysis of Air Force Space Command military systems and capabilities, to include development of analysis software and tools. They must also have detailed knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, capabilities, and their operations across all mission areas (OSC/DSC/SSA/C2).<br /><br />To mitigate schedule risks, interested parties must have an expert understanding of ongoing development efforts and developments in space control. Interested parties must be ready to initiate or continue analysis and products immediately upon contract award. Interested parties must also have expertise in developing, analyzing, and quantifying various concepts to form Families of Systems (FoS) that meet performance requirements. These FoS descriptions must include credible performance, cost, and schedule data to provide sufficient system trade spaces for decision-making. Interested parties must also have knowledge of current and planned space control policies and their effects on FoS. All interested parties must have the appropriate clearances to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have accredited SCIFs at the locations of primary performance to ensure contract performance upon award of a contract. Contractors shall perform this contract in the Los Angeles, CA and Colorado Springs, CO areas. The contractor may be expected to have accredited facilities in both of locations to support recurring meetings with SY and AFSPC. Support for meetings will be required at other locations.</p>
<p>Responses to this synopsis must be received via email to each POCs listed below: by 31 January 2010. Responses must be in electronic format (MS Word 2003 or newer, or PDF), and must conform to 8.5" X 11" page size, type 12 font, one-inch margins. Submittals must not exceed 10 pages (single sided) in length. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with either the primary or secondary points of contact. Any interested party in this area of expertise may submit a SOC. Response from small and small disadvantaged business is encouraged. All interested parties must be capable of supporting all tasks described above by the second quarter of government fiscal year 2012.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses to this notice.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call Mr. James Gill, USAF AFSPC SMC/PK at (310) 653-1789.</p>

The brief description<br>provided in the synopsis at www.fbo.gov would suggest that the work could be<br>performed equally well by other approved contractors.  We are well<br>established in the industry, 100% Veteran-Owned, extremely competitive and<br>diligent in our efforts to work with contracts such as these.  Can you<br>explain why a company like Calvex is prohibited from providing a proposal<br>for this work?   <br><br>ANSWER: Thank you for your interest in Solicitation W91ZLK-12-R-0006.  I apologize<br>for not being more specific in the notice.  The requirement is for technical<br>support and maintenance to include replacement parts of an existing system<br>for specialized, industrial, environmental chambers in support of DoD<br>testing requirements on certain ballistic programs.  The incumbent possesses<br>all proprietary rights to the controller programs, and all mechanical and<br>electrical drawings for existing HVAC controller systems.  <br><br>As it stands R.A. Walton is the owner of all proprietary information and<br>data.  All required services and maintenance must be accomplished by<br>individuals certified by R.A Walton to work on said systems.  At this time,<br>R.A. Walton has indicated to us that they have not certified anyone else to<br>be able to perform the work on this system.    <br>

Parking is available near the intersection of Dyer Street and Rock Island Avenue and also at Dyer Street and Picatinny Avenue.<br><br>The event will begin at 7:30 AM every day. Attendees should plan on arriving to WSMR at least one and one half (1.5) hours prior to the event so you may process through security, obtain a visitor's pass and check-in at the event. Check-in at the event will begin at 7:30 AM MST on the first day. AN AGENDA FOR THE WEEK WILL BE PROVIDED AT CHECK-IN.<br><br>All questions will be held until the final day. All questions and answers discussed at the Industry Day event will be published.<br><br>RSVP: Contractors electing to attend the Industry Day and site visits  must RSVP to Mari Beckler, Contract Specialist.  There is a limit of two (2) representatives per contractor.  No foreign nationals are permitted. The contractor must e-mail the attached RSVP form (see attached Microsoft Excel workbook. Fill out Boxes 2 thru 5.) to Mari Beckler at mari.b.beckler.civ@mail.mil by COB 6 February 2012. Due to security procedures, the persons attending the Industry Day must be listed on the RSVP form.<br><br>Las Cruces, NM is the closest city to WSMR, NM. The closest WSMR access gate is located off of US Highway 70. El Paso International Airport, El Paso, TX is the closest regional airport. Contractors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with their attendance at the Industry Day. Please visit the WSMR website, http://www.wsmr.army.mil/Pages/Home.aspx, for more information about WSMR.  The "WSMR at a Glance 2011" and the WSMR Factbook" are also attached for your basis information. Maps of WSMR are available at:<br>http://www.wsmr.army.mil/testcenter/Pages/WhereWeAre.aspx.<br><br>Occasionally, WSMR will block roads (including US Highway 70) in the area for missile tests. Please call the Road Block phone number, 575-678-1178, for recorded updates on planned roadblocks. The information is usually updated each weekday in the afternoon for the following day. Since the actual firing schedule can slide due to any number of circumstances like weather or equipment problems, travelers should also check the recording right before leaving to ensure nothing has changed.<br><br>Installation Access: All visitors must bring photo identification. To obtain a vehicle security pass you must have a driver's license, vehicle registration and proof of insurance. All visitors must enter WSMR through the Las Cruces main gate (located off of US Highway 70). Visitors must stop at the WSMR Reception Center to obtain their visitor's pass.<br><br>Safety: As a tri-service Department of Defense Range, White Sands has tested nearly every type of deployable ordnance developed in the United States since 1945. Quite a number of these munitions were deliberately designed to blend in with the terrain, and their presence may not be immediately obvious to the casual observer. Consequently, even though WSMR performs extensive Range Clearance activities, there is no assurance that any area of the Range is truly 100% free of unexploded ordnance. More information concerning unexploded ordnance hazards can be viewed at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/ux/Pages/default.aspx. The contractors are responsible to view the video found at this link under the title, UXO Hazards Video. You will be asked to sign a form, acknowledging that you have viewed this video at the check-in event. No person will be allowed to tour the range without first viewing this video. <br><br>Photography & Video Ban: No photographs or videos are allowed on WSMR except in the WSMR museum missile park area.<br><br><br>

<DESC>This contract is to provide contamination detectors to the Joint Project Manager for Nuclear Biological and Chemical Contamination Avoidance (JPM NBC CA) who will conduct the M3TD project that includes a data collection effort of contact and non-contact sensors for systems in the following core technology categories: (Category A) Ion Mobility Spectrometer (IMS), (Category B) Raman, (Category C) Mass Spectrometer (MS), (Category D) Infrared (IR), or (Category E) Other.  The M3TD hardware will be challenged against vapor, solid and liquid chemical compounds in accordance with the system's capabilities in order to evaluate the state of technology for detection of a variety of Chemicals of Interest (COI), which potentially will lead to refinement of current technology to meet future capability requirements in support of Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) defense programs.

<DESC>This contract is to provide contamination detectors to the Joint Project Manager for Nuclear Biological and Chemical Contamination Avoidance (JPM NBC CA) who will conduct the M3TD project that includes a data collection effort of contact and non-contact sensors for systems in the following core technology categories: (Category A) Ion Mobility Spectrometer (IMS), (Category B) Raman, (Category C) Mass Spectrometer (MS), (Category D) Infrared (IR), or (Category E) Other.  The M3TD hardware will be challenged against vapor, solid and liquid chemical compounds in accordance with the system's capabilities in order to evaluate the state of technology for detection of a variety of Chemicals of Interest (COI), which potentially will lead to refinement of current technology to meet future capability requirements in support of Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) defense programs.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents award of modification to the existing contractor Cahaba Government Benefit Administrators, LLC. under the current contract number HHSM-500-2009-M0004Z in the amount of $120,000 authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011. This data shall be obtained from the latest filed 12-month cost report. As later cost reports are accepted during the year, MACs shall update the data in FISS within 5 business days of acceptance of the cost report (for those hospitals that have not yet attested and received their initial payment).</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

Contractors shall have applicable expertise in government acquisition and program management disciplines.  See Solicitation VA244-12-R-0129 for additional information. This contract covers date of award through June 30, 2012.  

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c), as implemented by FAR 6.302.

	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Validity of Use (applicability of authority):   The incumbent is currently performing this complex requirement at a satisfactory level.   A change in vendor would require finding a vendor that is capable of servicing approximately 600 Veterans on home oxygen as well as over 600 Veterans using cpaps/bipaps.  The Vendor would need to have access to the equipment necessary to make this change and background checks would need to be completed on the new employees which would result in a delay in service; therefore, the only option available is to sole source to the incumbent.  A disruption in services is not an acceptable solution.  We have received a total of five protest regarding this requirement.  Two against the previous solicitation in which a ruling caused the Government to cancel that solicitation and reissue and three against this solicitation. We are awaiting a ruling on the most recent protest to the Court of Federal Claims.  This solicitation is extended indefinitely.  It is imperative that our patients have home oxygen services that are uninterrupted.  Our contract has expired which has made it necessary to put in place an interim contract.   This option represents the best value for the government.   The incumbent is honoring prices from the last contract to bridge the gap between the expired contract and the new award. This has already been proven fair and reasonable. The incumbent is already set up to provide this service and they are proven capable and responsible.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

Changing vendors for a 5-month period while the contract requirement is being solicited is not an option based on the complexity of this requirement. There is approximately 600 Veterans on the home oxygen program, as well as approximately 600 Veterans using cpaps/bipaps which are serviced by this contract.  The vast geographical area that is serviced by this contract makes it difficult and expensive to have the equipment switched out.   The contractor is responsible for providing all the equipment and supplies that are necessary to service this contract.  The award of a contract for a base plus for option years is anticipated within 30 days after the protest is ruled on and the solicitation can be closed.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The anticipated price to the Government is $ $497,475.  This option represents the best value for the government.   The incumbent is honoring prices from the last contract to bridge the gap between the expired contract and the new award. This price has already been proven fair and reasonable five years ago when the last contract was awarded. Based on proposals received on the first solicitation the price is fair and reasonable. The incumbent is already set up to provide this service and they are proven capable and responsible.    

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
The Government is awarding this contract to the incumbent to bridge the gap between the expired contract and the award of the contract currently under solicitation. Market research was completed for the solicitation currently under protest.  Based on that market research the procurement was designated as 100% HubZone set-aside. Market Research was conducted by advertising a sources sought notice through FedBizOpps under NAICS Code 532291.  One SDVOSB/HubZone, two Small Businesses/HubZone and one Large Businesses responded who were considered capable.    

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
Urgent and Compelling Need. 

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  One SDVOSB/HubZone, two Small Businesses/HubZone and one Large Businesses responded. 

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Procurement will be competitively acquired as a 100% HubZone set-aside once there is a protest ruling.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
