<DESC>Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum (JFC Brunssum) intends to issue an Invitation for International Bidding (IFIB) for the provision of catering services at its headquarters in Brunssum, The Netherlands.
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) be approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), 2) have performed two contracts within the last five years substantially similar in scope to the requirement described in the solicitation and 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFIB is IFIB-ACO-BRU-15-25 and all correspondence regarding the IFIB should include that reference.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the NATO member governments nominate potential prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidder list for this procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>U.S. firms should request a DOE (and, for U.S. firms new to NATO ICB, submit the one-time NATO ICB application): 22 July 2015</p>
<p>IFIB release: TBD</p>
<p>JWC Brunssum will directly e-mail this IFIB to all firms on its bidders list.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 01 January 2016 - 31 December 2016 (one base year plus four options years)</p>

<CONTACT>Ronald Stephen Sanford, Phone 301-619-9330, Email ronald.s.sanford2.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Sinclair Bio-Resources LLC; 562 State Road DD, Auxvasse, MO 65231-1012; for the performance of a research and development (R&amp;D) project in support of the Naval Medical Research Unit San Antonio (NAMRU-SA), Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The estimated period of performance of the project is 36 months.
<p><br />The research project will be for an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract to provide the delivery of healthy male Yucatan swine for research that focuses on the protection, resuscitation and stabilization of combat casualties at Echelon 1 and 2 points of care in the combat theater.</p>
<p>The healthy male Yucatan swine are required for critical on-going NAMRU-SA future scientific research efforts to have healthy, disease free animals from one vendor; this will ensure the scientific data generated is consistent, which is critical when testing different vendor devices under that same research environment. Due to the early involvement of Sinclair Bio-Resources LLC providing healthy male Yucatan in this ongoing research effort, they must continue to provide this supply until commencement to avoid the injection of inconsistency in study results. In addition, it is imperative that the new data collection is being created, collected and reviewed under the same controls as previous data collection to ensure an apples-to-apples analysis is being performed. This is critical to the integrity of the entire study and can only be accomplished through the use of the same supplier. In addition, Sinclair Bio-Resources LLC has an established history of delivering 100% healthy lots. Loss of one or two animals due to diseases will cause a major disruption on data collection and data analysis. A sources sought notice was issued on 30 June 2015 for this requirement and the Government determined after the review of capability statements, that no other source had the capability to perform the required work.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 1 (8.5 x 11 inch) page and shall be submitted in 12 point, Times New Roman font. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 3:00 PM Local Time, July 21, 2015. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: ronald.s.sanford2.civ@mail.mil.</p>

Grants are awarded for a one, two, or three-year period and typically include the following mandatory visits: an Evaluator orientation visit, a verification visit every six months or one year, and a final visit after the project has closed. Most grants are for a three-year period; therefore, over the life of a three-year grant the Contractor shall visit the grantee approximately six times. It is estimated that each visit to a grantee takes approximately 5 days, including preparing for the visit (contacting grantee, reading grant documentation, copying reports), travel time, interviews with the grantee and its beneficiaries, and drafting visit reports. This requirement includes the following tasks: contractor shall train grantees in the use of the IAF data collection instrument; train grantees on data collection strategies; assist grantees in the selection of indicators that present problems in collecting the required data; document and verify grant results with grantees, beneficiaries, and grantees' partners; draft reports documenting data verification visit findings; and write project history reports for terminating grants. In addition, when requested by the IAF, contractor shall accompany the IAF staff and Contractors on field trips; provide grant results verification services in other countries; and participate in training and/or conferences. The Contractor shall have fluency in Spanish and possess a working knowledge of Spanish (speaking and writing skills). The Contractor shall have a full time physical presence in Ecuador during the 5-year contract, and be willing to travel to remote areas of the country to conduct fieldwork at the grantees' physical location or where grant activities are taking place.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regard to its submission.
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Supervision Support Application Services Delivery (SSASD) Division within Information Technology Services (ITS) is managing the Central Application Tracking System (CATS) project for the Chief Counsel's Office (CCO). Within the CCO, the Licensing Department uses CATS to manage national bank and Federal Savings Association (FSA) data through the licensing of the following activities:<br />&bull; Forming a new national bank or FSA,<br />&bull; moving an existing institution into the national banking or FSA system,<br />&bull; acquiring control of a national bank or FSA, and <br />&bull; making structural changes and expand activities at an existing national bank or FSA, including mergers with other entities and branching.</p>
<p>These activities require national banks and FSAs to submit data (e.g., name, address, contact, size, assets) to the OCC about their institution and branches.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />The OCC is seeking information and ideas regarding:</p>
<p>(a) National bank and FSA data residing in your database and analysis of such data which can be used to supplement licensing activities (e.g., Analyst-Adjusted Financial Data, Bank Financials and Analytics, data insights), and <br />(b) 3rd party services that will assess the quality of the data provided by national banks and FSAs (e.g., comparing our data with a 3rd party database containing national bank and Federal savings association data), specifically including address information about key operational sites, including main offices, branches and subsidiaries.<br />The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury, is the primary regulator of all national banks and federal savings associations. The OCC is responsible for promoting the safety and soundness of the country's national banks and federal savings associations and maintaining its competitiveness, efficiency, integrity and stability in the financial marketplace.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OCC is requesting information from public and private sector organizations, corporations, and institutions addressing the needs specified in Section 2 (i.e., items a and b). <br />OCC invites vendors to assist with this market research by providing responses that include the following information. See section 4 for instructions about submitting your responses:<br />1) Contractor background summary including: contractor name, DUNS, GSA schedule identification, point of contact information, email, phone and business size.<br />2) Solution and Product Overview - Describe products or services available through your organization that address the needs specified in Section 2. For example, describe how you would assess and provide feedback on the quality of OCC national bank and FSA data.<br />3) Information Detail - Describe the national bank and FSA data in your database, and any assurances of data reliability and efficiency.<br />4) Data Security - Any data shared by the OCC must remain private and confidential and shall not be incorporated into the 3rd party vendor database. Describe how the OCC data will remain secure and confidential under a service agreement with your company.<br />5) Potential Cost Range - Estimate on a rough order of magnitude basis for the cost of this effort based on their experience and expertise (Please note that this is not a request for a formal quote). For scaling, we currently host information on approximately 1500 active national banks and FSAs and 48,500 active national bank branches plus 2877 FSA branches.<br />6) Schedule Estimate - Delineate factors which would affect the time it would take to conduct an assessment. Include specifics, where possible, about interim milestones/timeframes to achieve those dates, and any other information/recommendations relevant to scheduling.<br />The OCC understands the time and effort it may take to reply to all of these questions. Since we are just conducting market research for informational and planning purposes, the OCC would still welcome partial responses to the above requests but we ask that at a minimum, responses include information for items #1, #2, and #3.</p>
<p>FORMAT, DELIVERY DATE, AND POINT OF CONTACT</p>
<p>Responses will be submitted using Microsoft Office 2007/2010 or Adobe X PDF format and are due July 17, 2015 at 1:00 pm ET by email to Karen A. Green at Karen.green@occ.treas.gov. All correspondence must be via email; no phone calls. <br />Capability statements will address the questions outlined in the RFI and any relevant information that specifically addresses the company's capabilities to provide services. <br />Corporate Information <br />1) Name, mailing address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact<br />2) Corporate Web site address<br />3) Type of Business<br />a. Large business<br />b. Small business<br />c. Small disadvantaged business<br />d. 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business<br />e. HUB-Zone small business<br />f. Woman-owned small business<br />g. Veteran-owned small business<br />h. Service-disabled veteran-owned small business</p>
<p>4) DUNS number<br />5) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code classifications<br />6) List any existing vehicles (i.e. GSA, GWAC and etc.)<br />Failure to provide sufficient documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. When submitting responses, vendors shall clearly identify any information it considers sensitive or proprietary. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked "proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. <br /><br />DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in this response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.

<DESC><div>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is to formally announce the U.S. Department of Education's (Department's) intent to issue Solicitation ED-VAE-15-R-0037 to Advance Equity in Careern and Technical Education (CTE).<br /><br />Solicitation ED-VAE-15-R-0037 will be issued in the near term as a 100% total small business set-aside under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. &nbsp;Responses to Solicitation ED-VAE-15-R-0037 will be required to be submitted in sufficient time to be fully received by the Department no later than 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, July 31, 2015.<br /><br />A description of this procurement is provided below:<br />&nbsp;<br />The Advancing Equity in CTE project will complement the current activities of the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and related organizations by proactively investing in activities and programs that will better help the Department identify local, State, and national trends in CTE affecting students from underserved subpopulations. The Office of Career, Technical and Adult Eduction (OCTAE) seeks to advance programs and activities in CTE to serve all students; ensure the needs of underserved student subpopulations are being met; and increase student diversity in CTE programs.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order to achieve the objectives set forth by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, OCTAE plans to use this project to provide the Department with information regarding strategies and promising practices in advancing equity in CTE programs across the nation. OCTAE plans to share the information obtained (via electronic means) from this project with the field via a comprehensive literature review that identifies the causes of inequity that impede access to education, resources and jobs for CTE students. The literature review will provide an evidence base to help inform internal and external stakeholders&rsquo; understanding of &ldquo;equity&rdquo; and &ldquo;equity barriers,&rdquo; which will become the foundation for the development of policies and program proposals, as well as for the identification of policies and practices to be eliminated that currently hinder equity in career, technical and adult education programs and services.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>Additionally, the Department will develop methods to identify and disseminate practices in equity that have the potential for replication to advance and/or improve access and opportunity for career, technical, and adult education learners. &nbsp;These emerging or promising practices will be made available for public consumption via electronic access.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Department will also develop and disseminate an advancing equity in CTE toolkit that will serve primarily as a resource, particularly for state and local education agencies, academic staff, school administrators and counselors, parents and equity coordinators, to introduce issues of equality that fosters excellence in the development and delivery of programs, services and teaching and learning practices. The toolkit will assist education providers to promote accessible and inclusive learning environments for career, technical, and adult education learners.&nbsp;</div>

<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 22 JUL 2015.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Approved source is: Meggitt (North Hollywood), (79318).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Various increments solicited:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>20-25, 26-30, and 31-35.</p>

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology &amp; Genetics DCEG), Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program (EBP), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole source basis services related to the sampling, analysis, and data management of serum samples from the NCI Cohort Consortium including Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue North, M3-C862, PO Box 19024, Seattle, WA 98109.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 621511 and the business size standard is $32.5 Million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>HREB's research mission is to focus on hormonal and reproductive cancers, and other malignancies with possible hormonal etiologies (e.g., liver, esophageal). The HREB focuses on high-quality, high-impact research on hormonally-related cancers and cancers of the reproductive system: breast, endometrium, ovary, cervix, prostate and testis. They also seek to understand the epidemiology of a number of other malignancies, some of which are hormonally influenced. These include cancers of the liver and bladder, and esophageal adenocarcinomas. Their research is predicated on rigorous epidemiologic approaches, with integration of state-of-the-art methods for defining exposures of interest. The proposed study will be the first prospective analysis of inflammation markers and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The NCI will apply state-of-the-art laboratory analyses to quantitate circulating concentrations of inflammation markers and assess whether these are associated with subsequent risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall: (1) Select all individuals with a first cancer diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma (ICD-10: C150-159 with histology code ICD-O-3: 8140-8575) identified during follow-up that have at least 275 ul of pre-diagnostic serum available for analysis. (2) Use incidence-density sampling with replacement to match 1 control per case based on sex, race/ethnicity, date of birth (+/- 1 year), date of entry (+/- 1 year), exit date (&gt;=date of diagnosis of index case and defined as diagnosis of cancer [exc. NMSC], death, loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up), and number of freeze-thaw cycles of serum available for analysis. (3) Aliquot 275 ul of serum for each case and each control unless part of a random 10% selection, in which case 395 ul will be aliquoted. (4) Ship the samples to NCI and provide an electronic manifest that identifies the case-control pairs as well as the random 10% that have the higher volume of serum (395 ul). (5) Provide demographic, clinical, and questionnaire data needed for the statistical analysis. (6) All biological materials provided by the U.S. Government and all data generated shall be the property of the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The NCI Cohort Consortium is an extramural-intramural partnership formed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to address the need for large-scale collaborations to pool the large quantity of data and biospecimens necessary to conduct a wide range of cancer studies. The Consortium, through its collaborative network of investigators, provides a coordinated, interdisciplinary approach to tackling important scientific questions, economies of scale, and opportunities to quicken the pace of research. Based on this information this is a unique source to fulfill this requirement. All studies within the NCI Cohort Consortium were contacted to identify if they met the needs of this requirement. All studies that affirmed their capability have been included in this project. The Women's Health Initiative located at Fred Hutchinson can provide samples from their concurrent research activities and thus ensures a continuity of information.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.

<p>National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, (DCEG), Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis, 60,000 x 4ml urine specimens with its corresponding sample manifest data collected as part of the Golestan Cohort Study from Centre International De Recherche Sur Le Cancer (IARC), 150 Cours Albert Thomas, Lyon, FR 69008.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The Period of Performance is:<br />Base Option: 8/1/2015- 7/31/2016 Option Period 1: 8/1/2016-7/31/2017</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>IARC houses all 60,000 urine samples from the Golestan Cohort Study. This is the only repository of Golestan Cohort Study urine, and the Golestan Cohort Study is the only prospective cohort in the world with the questionnaire data, biospecimens and follow-up data that NEB needs to examine the association of exposure to tobacco product constituents (volatile organic compounds (VOCs), tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) and disease risk in such a large group of people habitually exposed to hookah and nass smokeless tobacco in addition to cigarettes. NEB has worked extensively and published widely using the data and biospecimens from the Golestan Cohort during the last number of years and to ensure consistency with prior protocols NEB is requesting to perform this current analysis of tobacco biomarkers in the same cohort. Thus, the data NEB can obtain from this urine is unique, and this urine from the Golestan Cohort Study cannot be obtained from any other source. This information will inform not only the DCEG Tobacco Group but also the FDA Tobacco Regulatory Group and the CDC. Thus, this information has the potential to benefit the government by contributing significantly to the body of evidence determining public health policy related to tobacco products.</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is to obtain 40,000 x 4ml urine specimens (and corresponding sample manifest data) collected as part of the Golestan Cohort Study from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyon, France for the Base Period.

<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found<br />despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The multi-user nature of NIH's UDP Translational Laboratory, along with its dynamic process structures, engenders a deep set of requirements for any candidate data and project management system.</p>
<p>UDP continues to work in conjunction with Cartagenia to continue providing Bench NGS and Bench Connector services and support to NHGRI UDP LIMS System. Cartagenia is the sole provider of the BENCH platform of software that the UDP laboratory has used for the past year. This software platform is unique that it offers a standardized data interpretation from both high-throughput Next Generation Sequencing and microarray data for its analysis and has been modified to fit NHGRI needs. The BENCH platform has the ability to detect structural and molecular variation measured by different technologies that includes copy number variation, loss of heterozygosity, single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions, and variant classification status (benign, pathogenic, etc.)</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is for Cartagenia to continue provide licenses, exome analysis, user accounts a software module. The Cartagenia Bench platform is a commercially available package, which is both cloud ready and has the ability to be diploid on-site. The features that are required for the government are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Storage and management of patient and assay data;<br />&bull; Storage and management of genetic assay results and associated clinical information;<br />&bull; Automatic communication with data analysis software from multiple assay platforms;<br />&bull; Ability to manage patient genomic data from NGS platforms;<br />&bull; Provide variant triage, filtering and annotation manually and via user-defined automated workflows;<br />&bull; Provide platform-wide search that will support searches based on phenotype, clinical criteria, genetic locus, custom administrative and clinical fields, cohort selection, and combined category searches;<br />&bull; Allow for automated literature analysis including the automatic retrieval of relevant publications;<br />&bull; Support collaboration both within the lab and between labs and organizations;<br />&bull; Contain an integrated and customizable reporting system; and<br />&bull; Interface included to communicate with deployed LIMs system.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:</p>
<p>Twelve (12) months from the date of award.</p>
<p>Justification:</p>
<p>Cartagenia Bench platform software is required by the Undiagnosed Diseases laboratory to reliably and systematically sift through large lists of patient genome variants derived from next generation sequencing and SNP microarray data in order to make informed calls on variants that are potentially deleterious and the cause of the unique disorders seen in admitted Undiagnosed Diseases Program patients. It is the only software available that can analyze and perform variant calls on both next generation sequencing (NGS) and microarray data. This software platform (which includes Bench lab NGS and CNV) will allow the personnel to manage and store the complexity of data volumes, large numbers of variants, samples and patients as well as phenotypic information and lab reports. The laboratory will be able to explore and identify disease mutations as well as consult heterogeneous information sources, public databases and algorithms for interpretation of next generation sequencing data. This license renewal will allow the UDP to perform exome analysis for up to 200 families, have user accounts for up to 20 internal NIH-UDP users, allow access for UDP collaborators, and supply the UDP with Bench connector which is a software module that is used for bi-directional communication to UDPICS.</p>
<p>Regulatory Authority:</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

<p>ISSO EXISTING IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE IS ALREADY OBTAINED FROM PREVIOUS CONTRACT.<br /><br />Procurement:</p>
<p>1. Hosting, Support and Maintenance for 12-Months;<br />2. Project Coordinator Role; <br />3. Narration for Videos; and<br />4. Enhancements</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. To that end NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. The Genomic Healthcare Branch (GHB) of the Division of Policy, Communication, and Education (DPCE) at the NHGRI was created to promote the effective integration of genomic discoveries into healthcare, lead the Institute's health professional education efforts, and advises the NHGRI director and senior staff on a broad range of issues regarding healthcare professional needs and involvement in the translation of genome research to clinical benefit. GHB activities are grouped into four broad areas:</p>
<p>1. Developing priorities for translational genomic research at the NHGRI and beyond.<br />2. Promoting the development and evaluation of tools that enable healthcare providers to take more effective advantage of advances in genomics.<br />3. Promoting genetics literacy among the full spectrum of healthcare providers and their patients. <br />4. Serving as a liaison between the healthcare community and the NHGRI, and encouraging dialogue with healthcare providers and organizations with an interest in the role of emerging genomic technologies in reshaping healthcare.</p>
<p>Genomic applications in healthcare are increasingly relevant to the day-to-day delivery of care to patients by all healthcare professionals. The NHGRI has been assisting the U.S. nursing, physician assistant, genetic counselor, pharmacist, and physician communities to apply standard competencies for genomics as well as supporting access to the educational resources necessary to achieve competency. In response to many organizations in these communities expressing a strong interest in having a centralized web resource for their educators, NHGRI funded the creation of an online tool to help educate the next generation of healthcare disciplines about this new frontier. The Genetics/ Genomics Competency Center is a free, web-based repository of curricular materials on genetics and genomics designed for nurses, physician assistants, genetic counselors, pharmacists, and physicians that facilitates communication, development, and dissemination of educational resources and approaches to achieve genetic/genomic competency. Providing healthcare professionals with a learning management system, based on a core set of competencies that organize genetic/genomic education materials enhances efforts to develop trans-disciplinary approaches to genetics/genomics education. The nursing, physician assistant, genetic counselor, pharmacist, and physician education communities have been working together to create this web-based education repository and have developed synergy between the five disciplines. Efforts to provide shared, competency-based curricular resources can now serve as a model for genetics/genomics education for the broader healthcare community which remains challenging to reach. Access this resource is available at http://www.g-2-c-2.org.</p>

This acquisition is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.<br /><strong><br />STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1. <br /><strong><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT <br /></strong><br /><strong>Background:<br /></strong>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. <br /><br />The NINDS Electromyography Section provides neurodiagnostic services to the NINDS and the NIH Clinical Center delivering vital information about the peripheral nervous system and muscles for both diagnostic purposes and use in clinical trials. A large portion of this work includes use of ultrasound equipment. The NINDS Electromyography Section is currently performing joint research studies using Terason uSmart ultrasound equipment with the NINDS Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Electromyography (EMG) Section with one (1) Terason uSmart Ultrasound System, including a 12 MHz probe and a 7.5 MHz probe, to upgrade the EMG laboratory's capabilities to evaluate nerve and muscle disorders. To ensure continuity of science, only a Terason uSmart Ultrasound System is acceptable to meet the needs of this requirement.<br /><br /><strong>Project Description<br /></strong>The Contractor shall provide the following:<br /><br />1. One (1) Tersaon uSmart 3200 Ultrasound System [Manufacturer's Part No. 21-0001]<br /><br />2. One (1) Terason uSmart 3200T Ultrasound Tablet [Manufacturer's Part No. 10-3232]<br /><br />3.

One (1) Terason 15L4 uSmart Linear Array Transducer with system [Manufacturer's Part No. 10-3289]<br /><br />7. One (1) Terason Standard 60-month warranty for the Ultrasound System [Manufacturer's Part No. WTY-60]<br /><br />8. One (1) Terason 5C2 uSmart Curved Array Transducer [Manufacturer's Part No. 10-3278]<br /><br />9. One (1) Terason One-Day One-Site Terason System Training in Bethesda Maryland [Manufacturer's Part No. 20-0007]<br /><br />10. One (1) Terason uSmart 3200T Cart [Manufacturer's Part No. 15-38000]<br /><br />11. The contractor shall provide shipping on a FOB Destination basis. <br /><br /><strong>Delivery Requirements/Period of Performance<br /></strong>Delivery and installation of the above detailed equipment is required within sixty (60) days after contractor receipt of order. All equipment, including equipment shipped separately, must be received within the sixty day period. The above detailed equipment training is required within three (3) days following delivery and installation of the equipment.<br /><br /><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br /></strong>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, only Terason, Inc. is capable of meeting the needs of this requirement to ensure continuity of science. Specifically, the NINDS EMG Section is currently working with the NINDS NNDC Section on joint research efforts and the NNDC Section utilizes a Terason uSmart&reg; 3200T Ultrasound System for this work. In order to ensure standardized research data between the two labs for joint research efforts, the EMG Section must have the exact same system. It is imperative that the EMG Section and the NNDC Section utilize the same equipment because use of different equipment would skew data between the laboratories, jeopardizing scientific data and invalidating any research conclusions stemming from the data. Accordingly, only a Terason uSmart 3200T Ultrasound System is acceptable for this requirement.<br /><br /><strong>CLOSING STATEMENT<br /></strong>THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B.

The contractor will be required to convert communication operations from INMARSAT-3 to INMARSAT-4.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. NGC is the sole designer, developer, and integrator of the BAMS-D UAS. Accordingly, it is the only contractor with the requisite personnel, technical knowledge, expertise, and technical data to provide the required services. Without this requisite knowledge and technical expertise the Navy would be unable to operate BAMS-D in theatre to provide support to deployed forces.</p>

All inquiries and concerns must be addressed to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Jacob Leitch at Jacob.Leitch@navy.mil or call 301-757-6593.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Integrated Governance Activity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) solicitation for USAID/Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) new Integrated Governance Activity (IGA). This activity will focus on strengthening key governance institutions in order to improve the delivery of health, education, and economic growth services at the community level and to strengthen the social contract between citizens and government in the DRC. USAID believes that by enabling the Government of DRC (GDRC) to assume its responsibilities (through strengthened capacity) and increasing its accountability to citizens, improvements to service delivery will be more sustainable and result in better health, education, and economic outcomes for beneficiary populations. This activity will have three objectives: (1) Capacity of select Congolese government institutions (both executive and legislative branch) to fulfil mandates strengthened; (2) Targeted sub-national government entities collaborate with citizens for more effective development; and (3) Citizen demand for accountable, transparent and participatory government services increased.</p>
<p>The activity will focus on four categories of beneficiaries: (1) GDRC executive and legislative institutions at the central and provincial levels; (2) local government actors responsible for delivering services; (3) civil society; and (4) citizens of DRC, with special emphasis on including historically marginalized groups, including women and youth. The anticipated period of performance for this award is five years, beginning in early 2016.</p>
<p>The upcoming solicitation will be a full and open competition under which all nongovernmental organizations will be eligible to compete. The procedures set forth in FAR Part 15 will apply. USAID anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursement fixed-fee completion type contract, with a total estimated price range of $38 -$42 million.</p>
<p><strong>Place of Performance:</strong> Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance:</strong> Five years from the award date, subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Solicitation Release Date:</strong> on or about August 01, 2015 (although USAID may release the solicitation 15 days after this notice in accordance with FAR 5.203(a))</p>
<p>This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and in no way obligates the US Government to issue an RFP/IFB and/or award a contract. The information herein below is released for wide dissemination to all parties and is indicative only. The information is subject to modification and is in no way binding to government and the estimate is based on the best information available at this time. This notice does not obligate USAID to award a contract, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of proposals.</p>
<p>Telephone inquiries will not be accepted. We will not directly respond to inquiries regarding this synopsis but may consider them in preparation of the RFP. Comments may be submitted via email to: kinshasaoaa@usaid.gov.</p>
<p>Please continue to monitor the Government Point of Entry (GPE) at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov for further information.</p>

FOR ANY INFORMATION CONTACT:  Scott Mahoney, RDER-PRP-G, (443) 395-6242 <br>  <br> This is a Market Survey to locate a source for the modification of existing check valves with NSN: 4820-01-449-5590 to meet the new performance requirements of Drawing 5035817 Rev F to meet the performance requirements of the next higher assembly (NHA), Mast-Group, Hydraulic-Pneumatic OA-9054(V)4/G (NSN: 5985-01-129-1794). The OA-9054(V)4/G Mast Group is part of the PATRIOT Missile Defense System and is used to carry the amplifiers and antennae associated with the UHF communications equipment located in the various PATRIOT shelters. The existing stock of check valves has been identified to not perform in accordance with (IAW) the NHA performance requirements due to an ambiguity in the technical drawing 5035817 Rev E. This acquisition is for a one-time modification/repair effort. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for these check valves is AutoValve Inc. CAGE: 3SDB5. Detailed technical data for the manufacture or acceptance of these items is not available from the Army. Suppliers capable of modifying these units must so indicate, by writing via email to scott.h.mahoney4.civ@mail.mil. The response must include production lead time, production capacity by month, surge capacity, ranges for price breaks if applicable or any other information that could affect the acquisition, supply and delivery of the parts.  The response should also include documentation such as a copy of a purchase order if the supplier was a vendor to the listed source or a statement from listed source demonstrating that the supplier can, in fact, supply the Army with these modified units from the supplier listed above.  Successful supplier may be required to warrant that the item supplied will satisfactorily perform when used for the purpose intended by the Army. For more information contact Scott Mahoney, RDER-PRP-G, (443) 395-6242. The deadline for response is 15 July 2015.

<DESC>Request for Information for Compression Test Data on Helmets <br>  <br> The U.S. Army PEO Solider is conducting a market survey to identify current capabilities and test results of compression testing in protective helmets.  The intent of this Request for Information (RFI) is to learn about the state of technology development within the helmet manufacturing community and find test data and results or performance data related to top to bottom and side to side helmet compression, which in turn may utilize such information for future requirements.  <br>   <br> The current ACH has requirements for top to bottom and side to side compression.  The current requirements for compression testing are stated in sections 3.12.11 and 3.12.12 of AR/PD 10-02 Rev A, with verification procedures in sections 4.9.14.11 and 4.9.14.12 of AR/PD 10-02 Rev A.   <br>  <br> Respondents may provide test data and results from current helmets or future helmet prototypes.  Of specific interest to PEO Soldier is data and results on helmet deflection immediately after compressive load cycles and 12 to 24 hours after compressive load cycles, with a focus on helmets lighter than the current Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH).   <br>  <br> Instructions to potential respondents- Deliverables: <br>  <br> Interested parties shall provide their final responses no later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight savings Time (EDT) on Wednesday, 15 July 2015 to Kelly Doolittle at kelly.l.doolittle.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> PEO Soldier will conduct a preliminary review of all responses.

The finished shell without the edging or an unfinished shell shall be tested on a constant rate of extension (CRE) machine in accordance with ASTM Test Method D76 except that the machine shall be used in the compression mode as follows: Use a fixture or jig to completely support the test specimen around its periphery. The fixture or jig shall extend at least 1.0-inch beyond the edge of the finished shell on the same plane as the edge (not up the sides of the test specimen) to ensure that it is supported. Position and center the test specimen on the jig on the base platen of the machine so that the test specimen is in the as-worn position and the planes (see drawings 2-1-2515, 2-1-2516, 2-1-2517, 2-1-2518, and 2-1-2576) are parallel to the platen. While in this position, measure and record and mark the maximum height reading of the test specimen at its apex to the nearest 0.001-inch. Using a 2.50-inch diameter flat anvil, compress the shell at its vertex at the rate of 12.0-inches per minute until a compressive force of 400-pounds is reached. Release the applied force to 5.0-pounds and repeat testing for 24 additional cycles. Within 5-minutes of the completion of the last cycle, again measure and record the height dimension in the same manner as above. After a period of 24-hours (  1 hour), again record the height dimension. One (1) shell from each size shall be tested. Failure to meet the requirements of paragraph 3.12.11 shall constitute failure of the test.  <br>  <br> 4.9.14.12 Compression resistance (side to side). The finished shell without the edging or an unfinished shell shall be tested on a constant rate of extension (CRE) machine in accordance with ASTM Test Method D76, except that the machine shall be used in the compression mode per the following. Measure, record and mark the maximum shell width dimension of the test specimen to the nearest 0.001-inch. Using a 2.50-inch diameter flat anvil position the test specimen so that the highest width dimension is aligned with the center of the top anvil. Suitable means shall be made to keep the test specimen in position so long as the means does not add to the structural rigidity of the shell. A method successful used is shown in Figure 5. Note that Figure 5 shows a finished shell - unfinished shells are permitted. Compress the test specimen at the rate of 12-inches per minute until a force of 300-pounds is reached. Release the applied force to 5.0-pound and repeat testing for 24 additional cycles.  Within 5.0-minutes of the completion of the last cycle, again measure and record the height dimension in the same manner as above. After a period of 24-hours (  1 hour), again measure and record the height dimension. One (1) shell from each size shall be tested. Failure to meet the requirements of paragraph 3.12.12 shall constitute failure of the test. <br>

All information available at the time of publication relating to administrative responsibilities, technical responsibilities, performance requirements and workload estimates, are documented in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS).  <br> The Government seeks to maintain the caretaker operations services for the former WRAMC Installation, until some or all remaining parcels are transferred.  Should the transfer of the Land Reuse Authority (LRA) parcel occur, during the period of performance of the contract, the contract will be modified to incorporate: A revised PWS; an implementation schedule; and revised funding for the transition and implementation of the revised PWS. <br>  <br> It is the responsibility of potential offerors to be responsible for performing all operations and maintenance functions to support the former WRAMC Installation.  This acquisition has historically been set aside for 8(a) small businesses; therefore, the information received from this SSS will determine, if enough competitive 8(a) vendors are available.  The information received from this SSS will be used by the Government as a preliminary planning tool for the purposes of obtaining information regarding the availability and capability of qualified 8(a) businesses under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561210, Facilities Support Services.

The current contract was awarded with a one year base period and a six-month option period under Contract Number W9124J-14-C-0074, valued at more than $15M.  For informational purposes only, historical data regarding the dollar amount awarded under the current contract may be found on www.fpds.gov. <br>  <br> This required was previously put in the 8(a) program therefore in accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(3)(i), in order to determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency need exists, the Government will consider SSS responses received from all 8(a)'s.  Responses to this SSS permit the contracting officer, in accordance with FAR 19.203(c), to consider rather there are enough 8(a) concerns to allow for competition.  Provide suggestions on how the requirement could be structured to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.

This command C2 system prototype will be designed to operate in Ku-Band [14.0-14.5 GHz (uplink); 11.7-12.2 and 12.5-12.75 GHz (downlink)] and/or Ka-Band [27.5-30.0 GHz (uplink);  7.3-17.7, 18.1-18.8, 19.7-20.2 GHz (downlink)], while following draft industry performance requirements currently under consideration in RTCA SC-228 and ITU-R WP5B.  Even though both terrestrial and	satellite based solutions are under consideration in the standards bodies, the focus of this effort is on a satellite based system. <p> This prototype radio hardware is being designed and developed in order to validate and verify draft performance requirements by collecting performance data in relevant laboratory and flight environments.  The results of this testing may necessitate the modification of the prototype radio(s) and/or proposing modifications to the draft performance requirements.  The prototype design and development process will be one which follows a proven path to certification. <p> The intended partnership between NASA and one or more industry partners will jointly: develop the design(s) to meet the requirements, develop prototype radio hardware, perform laboratory testing, and execute flight testing of the prototype radio system in a relevant environment. This prototype radio system is targeted for use in medium and large UAS classes, including those weighing more than 55 lbs	lying above 3,000 ft. up to and including those weighing greater than 1,320 lbs flying above 18,000 ft.  The primary focus is operations within the U.S. National Airspace System, but these systems should be capable of operations outside the U.S.	The UAS C2 system is to support control and non-payload communications (CNPC) between the Unmanned Aircraft (UA) and the UA control station. This could include the following types of information/traffic types: telecommands; non-payload telemetry; navaid data; ATC voice relay; ATS data relay; sense and avoid data relay; airborne weather radar data; and non-payload situational awareness video. <p> Qualified providers are considered to be U.S. commercial entities that are established and recognized manufacturers of avionics equipment and/or associated communication/navigation/surveillance ground hardware, who have previous history in the successful development and production of certified radio transceiver equipment. <p> Interested companies are invited to submit specific information on any or all of the following topics: <p> 1.

<p><br />1.	Solicitation Number:	HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-SS-2015-463</p>
<p>2.	Title:  AlphaLISA Albumin Assay kit, 5000 assay points</p>
<p>3.	NAICS Code:  423460</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability, conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives.  <br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) section is requesting the AlphaLISA Albumin Assay kit, 5000 assay points from PerkinElmer for the use of stem cell-derived hepatocytes differentiation project, in collaboration with NIDDK.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase the AlphaLISA Albumin Assay kit from PerkinElmer for hepatocyte differentiation project-Screening Compounds for Promoting Hepatocytes Differentiation from Human Stem Cells. We seek the technology/method to test the Albumin secretion level from stem cell-derived hepatocytes in a highly sensitive, quantitative, reproducible and user-friendly mode upon compound library treatment.</p>
<p>Project requirements: The hepatocyte differentiation project is a project in collaboration with Dr. Jake Liang's group at NIDDK. Hepatic differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells leads always to generation of hepatocytes like cells (HLCs), which retaining a strong fetal phenotype (maintenance of AFP expression, low albumin (ALB) production). In this context, we hypothesized that small compounds may have an improving effect on the level of cell maturation of the HLCs. <br />In order to perform a high throughput screening of small compounds on stem cell-derived HLCs, our collaborator, Dr. Liang's lab has recently developed an optimized protocol (Carpentier, et al. Stem cells reports, in revision.) allowing the differentiation HLCs in a reproducible and consistent way, suitable for high throughput assay. We plan to treat the HLCs, cultured in 384 well plates, with different compounds from NCATS compound library. In order to assess the effect of the compounds on the level of maturation of the cells, we are planning to measure the secretion of Albumin by using the AlphaLISA technology. It will give us the unique opportunity to assess secreted Albumin without having to transfer supernatants or do wash steps as for ELISA, thus allowing increased consistency.<br />The ultimate purpose of this project is to identify some hits compounds which can significantly promote stem cell-derived hepatocyte differentiation/maturation. The primary hits identified will be then individually validated using a series of phenotypic (percentage of positive cells for hepatic mature markers) and functional (CYP450 metabolism) hepatic assays. <br />Currently, our collaborator at NIDDK has performed preliminary testing to determine the Albumin secretion level of iPS-derived hepatocyte on 384 well plate using the AlphaLISA Albumin kit, which showed high sensitivity and consistency. We will need the same assay format to provide the comparable data for the selectivity.<br /> <br />PerkinElmer Inc. has provided us with a significant 40% discount and customizes the AlphaLISA Albumin kits (5000 points/kit) based on our high throughput compound library screening project needs.<br />Anticipated period of performance: Reagent kit will be delivered in a week after receipt of order.</p>
<p>The respondent must also provide their  DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HubZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code and any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the acquisition requirements.</p>
<p>One (1) copy of the response is required and must be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format using 11-point or 12-point font, 8-1/2" x 11" paper size, with 1" top, bottom, left and right margins, and with single or double spacing.</p>
<p>The information submitted must be must be in and outline format that addresses each of the elements of the project requirement and in the capability statement /information sought paragraphs stated herein.  A cover page and an executive summary may be included but is not required.</p>

<DESC>Introduction:<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br />This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a purchase order. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement:<br />The purpose of this potential requirement is to collect human postmortem human brain tissue, various specimens at autopsy, and medical/toxicology information that may be of interest to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for research into the neurobiology of major mental disorders.   The donated postmortem human brain tissue and specimens will be used by the Human Brain Collection Core for research into the neurobiology of complex mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, depression, substance abuse and suicide) in order to better understand the basis of these disorders. This research will hopefully lead to improved diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of these illnesses and their consequences.</p>
<p><br />North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) CODE:<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 541990 - All Other Profession, Scientific, and Technical Services - and the associated small business size standard of $14.0 million dollars</p>
<p>Project Requirements:<br />The Contractor will collect human brains and specimens that may be of interest to the NIMH for research into the neurobiology of major mental disorders.</p>
<p>The donated human brains and specimens will be used by the Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) for research into the neurobiology of complex mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, depression, substance abuse and suicide) in order to better understand the basis of these disorders. This research will hopefully lead to improved diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of these illnesses and their consequences, including suicide.</p>
<p>On a daily basis, the Contractor, will review each case for potential donation to determine which cases may be of interest to HBCC research, in particular those who have signed organ donor cards and others with a reasonable suspicion of a history of mental or neurological illness, particularly schizophrenia as well as non-psychiatric controls across the lifespan. Once a case is selected, the Contractor will contact HBCC personnel and will provide: 1) the general background of the case; 2) information regarding whether the deceased is an organ donor; and 3) the name and telephone number of the deceased next-of-kin. HBCC staff will promptly contact the next-of-kin of the decedent to obtain consent (via a recorded telephone call) to utilize the deceased subject's brain and skull contents (including dura, pituitary, pineal, and upper cervical spinal cord), blood and hair sample for research. HBCC staff will also solicit the release medical records.  Once consent is obtained by HBCC personnel, the Contractor is notified to extract the brain, a full-length hair sample with a small piece of contiguous scalp, and 40cc of blood.  The Contractor will begin extraction promptly upon notification of approval from the NIMH; whenever possible, the process should begin within 24 hours of death; unless approved by the NIMH Project Officer, specimens extracted beyond 48 hours cannot be accepted for donation.  The Contractor will provide to the HBCC any relevant information related to a specimen including cause and manner of death, relevant history and/or toxicology in order to allow optimal characterization of the specimen, provided this information does not compromise the forensic evaluation of the case.  The Contractor will properly prepare and package the specimen in accordance with all Federal, State and City regulation.</p>
<p>The Contractor should be an expert at selecting cases that qualify for HBCC research and in obtaining pertinent psychiatric medical history information necessary for our analyses. As required, the Contractor shall supply HBCC with a report which includes, cause of death, family/medical histories, and any toxicology results.  This information is imperative for the full characterization of any specimens to be included in the HBCC postmortem research study.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance:<br />The anticipated period of performance is twelve months.</p>
<p>Capability Statement:<br />Contractors that believe they possess the ability to provide the required services should submit documentation of their ability to meet the project requirements to the Contract Specialist.  Contractors should also provide their Company Name, DUNS number, Physical Address, and Point of Contact Information.</p>
<p>Interested organizations are required to identify their type of business, applicable North American Industry Classification System Code, and size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration. The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in a response to this notice. However, responses that indicate the information therein is proprietary will be properly safeguarded for Government use only. Capability statements must include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will be considered non-responsive. When submitting this information, please reference the solicitation notice number.</p>

<p>TITLE: LiveBLAzer FRET B&frasl;G Loading Kit 5 MG</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives: <br />LiveBLAzer FRET B&frasl;G Loading Kit has a membrane permeant ester form known as CCF4-AM. CCF4-AM is a lipophilic form of the CCF4 substrate which allows it to readily enter cells. Upon entry, cleavage by endogenous cytoplasmic esterases rapidly converts CCF4-AM into its negatively charged form, CCF4, which is retained in the cytosol. CCF4 is a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) substrate which consists of a cephalosporin core linking 7-hydroxycoumarin to fluorescein. This product is to be used as a FRET-based substrate for &beta;-lactamase as a sensitive reporter of mammalian gene expression in the Gene Blazer technology.<br />Detection of Gene Blazer assays is FRET-based. Each substrate is labeled with two fluorophores that form an efficient FRET pair. In the absence of beta-lactamase activity, exciting the coumarin at 409 nm in the intact CCF4 molecule results in FRET to the fluorescein, which emits a green fluorescence signal at 530 nm. In the presence of beta-lactamase activity, however, cleavage of CCF4 spatially separates the two dyes and disrupts FRET, so that exciting the coumarin at 409 nm now produces a blue fluorescence signal at 460 nm. This blue signal can be readily observed under a microscope and can also be detected as an increase in the blue channel readout on fluorescent microplate readers. Ratiometric analysis of the blue and green signals reduces well-to-well variation due to differences in cell numbers and substrate loading, leading to high Z&acute;-factor values and low coefficients of variations (CVs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>Specifically, the NCATS DPI Chemistry group requires the following:</p>
<p>LiveBLAzer FRET B&frasl;G Loading Kit 5 MG Qty. 10 cases</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: 30 days ARO</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT <br />Contractors that believe they possess the ability to provide the required equipment should submit documentation of their ability to meet each of the project requirements to the Contract Specialist.

<DESC>The National institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses to provide the NIH with rental of cold/hot water coolers (no-spill system), delivery of bottled drinking water and cups. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS. This is a request for interested firms with the capability of providing the required services to submit a capability statement for the purpose of determining whether or not this procurement will be set aside for small/small disadvantaged businesses. For small business set-asides, any concern proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must furnish the product of a small business manufacturer. The intended procurement will be classified under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 312112 with a size standard of 500 employees. Many of the buildings located at the NIH main campus, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD and various NIH facilities located in Rockville, MD contain drinking water with an unacceptable level of lead content. The NIH Office of Research Services is responsible for supplying drinking water to those facilities where the water has been determined to contain unacceptably high lead content. Under any resultant contract, the contractor shall be responsible for furnishing rental coolers (cold/hot dispenser), "no-spill" system, equipped with cup dispenser. Currently the NIH has approximately 2,000 coolers located in various locations. The contractor shall deliver bottled water/cup to each water cooler twice weekly (Tuesday and Friday), excluding Federal holidays. If the scheduled delivery falls on a Federal holiday, the contractor shall delivery the bottled water on the following workday. Contractor-furnished bottle racks shall be provided at each location next to the coolers for both back-up water bottles and empty water bottles. The contractor shall be responsible for replacing any water cooler which is determined to be dirty, has an order, or the water develops an unusual taste. At the request of the Government, new facilities may be added throughout the life of any resultant contract which shall be serviced by the contractor. Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (1) a capability statement demonstrating their experience and capability to fulfill the Government's requirement. Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the area under consideration. Experience should identify on-going and/or previous contracts performed including a brief description, dollar value, client's name, address, telephone number, and name of contact and duration of contract. (2) available resources; (3) firm's size and type of business (e.g., small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), etc.); and, (4) evidence of membership in the International Bottled Water Association partnerships or the National Sanitation Foundation. Interested firms responding to this notice that propose to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must identify the name of the manufacturer they intend to utilize under any resultant contract. Two copies of the capability statement must be received at the address identified in this synopsis no later than 10 calendar days from date posted on FedBizOpps. When utilizing a courier service, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail, the city, state and zip code MUST READ ROCKVILLE, MD 20852. Responses by facsimile (FAX) WILL NOT be accepted. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.
<p><br />Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether sufficient small businesses possess the capability to fulfill the Government's requirement and to ensure competition under a set-aside acquisition. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Office of Center Director (OCD) in Wyndmoor, PA, intends to award a purchase order to Air Products and Chemicals Inc., in Allentown, PA 18195-9642, on a sole source basis, to furnish and deliver (FOB) Destination Liquid Nitrogen to Eastern Regional Research Center in Wyndmoor, PA. This is a firm fixed price contract. The liquid nitrogen is part of a distributed system that provides inert gas to the laboratory benches supporting experiments that require inert shielding. It is also used in liquid form to provide critical cooling to select instruments including an NMR. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely at the discretion of the Government in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS code is 325120. The Solicitation number is AG-3JL0-S-15-0004. This is not a request for proposal. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. <br />Justification for other than full and open competition<br />1. USDA, Agriculture Research Service, Eastern Regional Research Center. 2. The Government intends to enter into a firm-fixed price purchase order to supply Liquid Nitrogen to Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC). 3. Supply Liquid Nitrogen to Eastern Regional Research Center and a tank rental fee. 4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY: FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).

Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., currently provides liquid N2 to the ERRC main building through an installed 6000 gallon storage tank, associated gasifier, piping and equipment. The cost of replacing this installed infrastructure is well in excess of any potential savings in the nitrogen purchased during the term of the Sole Source contract. Procuring liquid nitrogen from a vendor other than Air Liquid and Chemicals, Inc., at this time would negatively impact ERRC's ability to accomplish its mission due to disruption and excessive cost. 6. A Federal Business Opportunities notice is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required equipment containing the necessary specifications required to produce the same results. 7. Anticipated costs are expected to be fair and reasonable to the Government based on established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public and when compared to similar items from other manufacturers'. 8. Market research was conducted appropriate to the circumstances of this requirement. 9. Selected vendor is the manufacturer of the required system. Reference FAR 13.106(b)(1) - For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. 10. No other sources have been identified. 11. An announcement of intent is being posted in order to determine if another source is more advantageous to the Government. 12. Data and representations included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate. 13. Technical Information and Supporting Technical Data that is the responsibility of the technical and requirements official and which form the basis for this justification are certified as complete and accurate. I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge. /s/ Regina Dennis, Contract Specialist.

Award to any other firm would also create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the requirements as it would require solicitation, award and the mobilization of a new workforce to begin full performance in less than 15 days which is not feasible for a contract of this size and complexity.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />(6) Description of Solicitation Efforts: IAW FAR 5.102(a)(1), this notice will be posted on the Government-wide Point of Entry (FedBizOpps.gov), but retained in the contract file to document the rationale for a sole source award.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; mso-add-space: auto"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">(7) The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon a comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases, and with the governments independent estimate.<br /><br />(8) Description of market research: The most recent market research for this requirement, solicitation FA4418-14-R-0012 JB Grounds, revealed HubZone business concerns are most common for the performance of grounds maintenance of acreage required by this requirement.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), intends to issue a sole source purchase order with Pro-Drive, for the purchase of (3) 25 HP KOH Pro Drive Tiller Boat Motors and crating.
<p>This is a sole source justification as Pro-drive is the only shaft driven shallow drive outboard that is built for commercial use. We have reviewed construction designs of similar types of motors and found that none are built heavily enough to withstand the intensive and daily use we subject our equipment to. In addition, the Pro-drive offers full power automatic reverse (unique to this manufacturer) which is an advantage to getting out of the muddy shallow water areas we routinely conduct work in. In addition, the maintenance mechanic has taken training from Pro-drive to completely dismantle and repair these motors so for efficiency sake, we would like to keep all the same motors on our fleet of boats.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for equipment for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiated with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Simplified procurement procedures will be used as well as commercial item acquisition procedures per FAR 12. For additional information please contact Latisha Hollman at (919) 855-7003 or latisha.a.hollman@aphis.usda.gov.</p>

<DESC>NOAA's NMFS, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Auke Bay Laboratories, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Marport Stout, Inc. under this notice ABL-15252. The government intends to acquire the Marport Sensors using Far part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures not to exceed $150,000.
<p>The Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC) is a government agency charged with the mission of stewardship for living marine resources. The Center provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise use of the Alaska region's marine and anadromous resources.</p>
<p>The Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE) has a requirement for Marport net mensuration sensors to measure net spread and mouth height to ensure that each and every tow used for stock assessment meets rigorous standards. Marport sensors are sophisticated electronic instruments used for measuring the area swept by the bottom trawl during Alaska fish and crab surveys. The Marport sensors must perform to the manufacturer's specifications and provide accurate and precise measurements during surveys. Marport net monitoring systems are widely used in the commercial fishing industry and have been used in all Groundfish Assessment Surveys conducted in harsh marine conditions such as occur regularly in Alaska's Bering and Chukchi Seas. Marport acoustic net mensuration systems utilize complex and proprietary algorithms that provide detailed measurements and vivid images for how a survey trawl is performing relative to its engineered design. The proposed vendor is the only vendor that can manufacture and provide these items. We estimate that each charter vessel should start the survey season with 3 full sets of sensors (master + slave). At present, we have only enough sensors to provide 2 units to each charter. Therefore the RACE Division desires to purchase over the next several years additional Marport master and slave sensors so that our working inventory consists of 15 sets. Purchase of up to six (6) new master and eight (8) new slave sensors total.</p>
<p>The period of performance is for a one-year base period with three one-year option periods. Periods 09/15 - 09/20. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 334419 with a corresponding size standard of 500 employees. Award for this requirement will be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested person may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If you feel that your firm possesses the ability to provide these requirements, then you must respond by demonstrating your firm's technical capability to meet these requirements by July 21, 2015, 12:00 PM Alaska Time. In order to protect proprietary information and prevent the unintentional releasing of guarded information all interested firms must conduct their own research regarding the specifications of the above listed item. No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy these requirement</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO NEGOTIATE ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS
<p>This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source contract pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source, which applies when the supplies/services required by the agency are only available from one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government intends to negotiate a contract with University of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico Seismic Network (PRSN), Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS)/Tsunami Program has a requirement for maintaining and improving the tsunami warning system in the Caribbean. The PRSN maintains a partnership with NOAA, the University of Puerto Rico, the Government of Puerto Rico and the State Emergency Management Agency to continue to operate with on-site personnel 24 hours a day 7 days a week for the benefit of NOAA's Tsunami Warning Centers (TWC), as well as residents and visitors of Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, and adjoining regions. Work includes:</p>
<p>1.1. Tsunami Monitoring Infrastructure and External Support</p>
<p>1.1.1. Seismic Instrumentation<br />The contractor shall operate and maintain the existing network of 24 broadband stations and 4 short period stations. These stations are located throughout Puerto Rico, the US and British Virgin Islands, and Eastern Dominican Republic. The data from these stations are used to determine the location and magnitude of an earthquake, and hence, the possibility of a tsunami. Continued and effective acquisition and analysis of data from over 120 seismic stations from the Caribbean and adjoining regions shall also be maintained. Acquisition and maintenance of equipment and materials shall continue for the seismic stations contributing to the Tsunami Warning System in order to continually improve TWC detection thresholds and quality of the data, reduce data latencies and gaps, and improve data storage capabilities.</p>
<p>1.1.2. Sea Level Instrumentation<br />The contractor shall continue operation and maintenance of the existing 6 tsunami-capable sea level gauges in Puerto Rico. These stations shall meet the NOAA standards for measuring tsunami and other short term events (winter and tropical storms) as well as long term trends (sea level rise). Maintenance is to be provided to the stations, which shall include equipment and communications improvements for the sea level stations to ensure the delivery of a continuous high rate of sea level data to the TWCs. Currently, four (4) tide gauge stations transmit data every minute directly to PRSN. This two-way communication link shall be established to an additional station in 2015. Recalibration and resurveying of sea level gauges shall be performed in accordance with NOAA's National Ocean Service standards. Continuation of online sea level data availability will be maintained and improved as necessary.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc., for two 24-position Sea-Bird Electronics carousels for the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) in Miami, FL.
<p><br />A Sources Sought notice was posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website on June 24, 2015 and closed on July 6, 2015. No responses were received.</p>
<p>The following equipment is required:<br />&bull; Two (2) 32P.xxxx CAROUSEL WATER SAMPLER (full size) PYLON-includes electronics/release pylon with mounting hub<br />&bull; Two (2) 32P.24xx Aluminum housing 6800 meter, 24 bottle capacity<br />&bull; Two (2) XSG/AG connector and Modem Interface compatible with SBE 9Plus CTD and 1lplus Deck Unit, or SBE 9Plus CTD and SBE 17plus V2 or SBE19/19plus V2/25/25 plus CTD and AFM</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification<br />AOML's Physical Oceanography Division (PHOD) currently owns six Sea-Bird 911 Plus Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) systems and seven 24-position carousels. The CTD system is used to collect vital oceanographic data that is required to meet the goals of field projects. The required 24-position carousels will be used on upcoming cruises. These carousels are required as they are fully interchangeable with the existing carousels and have the required specifications to match the existing carousels and complementary equipment owned by NOAA/AOML/PHOD. To keep the CTDs running at sea where spare parts are not easy to obtain having full compatibility and interchangeability is important and paramount. The purchase of these carousels will reduce time spent training personnel and maintain continuity and consistency in the data collected. Furthermore, NOAA/AOML/PHOD owns four Seabird 11 deck boxes which provide the real time data acquisition and control for the 24-position carousel. The software used by NOAA/AOML/PHOD to control the Seabird 11 deck box is proprietary software developed by Seabird. The software via the SBE 11 deck box issues the commands to the 24-position carousel actuators so bottles will open and close at desired depths. The ability to determine depths for water collection assists in gaining accurate data for the chemical makeup of local water. Using a carousel that is not fully interchangeable could cause damage or malfunction to the CTD. The cost to replace a CTD is $30,000. Because of the complications that would arise, there would certainly be errors in hardware and software and thus the data collection of the field projects would be compromised . Using a carousel that is not identical would cost approximately 1 years' worth of a programmer's time to establish duplicate software routines to operate. Control/quality assurance software would need to be rewritten to handle a different data format and many hours of testing would be needed. NOANAOML/PHOD knows of no other company able to supply an identical carousel.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought/Request for Information only.  This is not a Solicitation Announcement, nor is it a Request for Proposal.  This request does not obligate the Government to award a contract.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District (USACE-SAS), is conducting research to determine the market capabilities of potential contractors.   <br>  <br> USACE-SAS intends to execute five supplemental agreements for five multiple award task order contracts (MATOCs) to extend the contracts' ordering period 33 days each, from 29 August 2015 through 30 September 2015.   The MATOCs resulted from an unrestricted competition for firm-fixed-price construction within the Savannah District and South Atlantic Division (SAD), and is referred to as the  quote mark 09-02 GA SC General Construction MATOC quote mark .   Currently, the ordering period for the current contracts in the unrestricted GA SC General MATOC pool is set to end on 29 August 2015, which will leave Savannah District without an unrestricted MATOC to support the Military and Support for Others (SFO) programs.  The MATOC RFP W912HN-09-R-0088 was issued for two-phase Design Build, Design Bid Build, new construction, renovation, training, maintenance, site work, and infrastructure, within the South Atlantic Division Area of Operations which includes North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi.  Typical project locations are on military installations within Georgia and South Carolina.  The GA SC General Construction MATOC was awarded with a capacity of $499,000,000.00.  Each contract contains a three-year base period, and two  quote mark 365 day quote mark  option periods.    <br>  <br> USACE-SAS proposes to extend the ordering period of the five contracts by 33 days each, from 29 August 2015 to 30 September 2015, to facilitate the award of a task order for the Aerial Gunnery Range (AGR),  Project No. 55121, Ft. Bragg, NC.   RFP W912HN-09-X-8809 for the AGR was issued on October 17, 2015, and final proposals were received on February 3, 2015 with a 210 day BAP.   Primary facilities of this project include the AGR, site preparation, live fire village, forward armament and refuel pad, operations control area, control tower, after action review building, operations/storage building, bleacher enclosure, covered mess, latrine, ammunition breakdown building, bivouac area, and building information systems.  Sustainability/Energy measures will be provided.  Supporting facilities include electric service; water, sewer, gas, site improvements, and information systems.  Facilities will be designed to a minimum life of 50 years and energy efficiencies meeting, on average, American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 189.1 standards through improved building envelope and integrated building systems performance.  Eight buildings will require demolition (4,000 Total SF).  The Air-Conditioning system is estimated at 25 Tons. <br>  <br> The USACE-SAS intends to award these extension modifications under the GA SC General Construction MATOC upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This MATOC is the only contracting vehicle that can facilitate award of the AGR without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  Unless this MATOC is extended, substantial duplication of costs will occur that is not expected to be recovered through further competition.  In addition, unacceptable delays will occur fulfilling agency's requirements for the AGR in support of our troops. <br>  <br> The Government will support the proposed action with a written Justification & Approval (J&A), and will post it to ASFI upon final approval prior to proceeding.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement; however, this  quote mark Special Notice of Intent quote mark  is NOT a request for proposal.  All capability statements received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this notice will be reviewed by the Government and considered.   However, a determination by the Government NOT to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If your firm wishes to submit a capability statement, it should demonstrate  the Offeror's expertise to provide the services identified above.  Interested firms with approved NAICS 236220 have until July 20, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. EST to submit the following information: <br>  <br> -	Name & Address of your Firm <br>  <br> -	Point of Contact (name/telephone/email) <br>  <br> -	DUNS No. & CAGE Code <br>  <br> -	Business Size, to include designation as HUBZone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Own Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, Woman-Owned Business, and Large Business.

Please provide at least one point of contact (with email address and phone number) for project validation.

The Government may not give credit to your socio-economic class if there is not sufficient documentation, or if the Government cannot verify status. <br>  <br> If you intend to submit information in response to this  quote mark ASFI Special Notice quote mark ,  you may submit via email to julie.m.oliver@usace.army.mil no later than July 20, 2015 at 10:00 a.m. EST.

<DESC><p>Event: Industrial Operation Division (IOD) Industry Day</p>
<p>Sponsor: Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) Industrial Operations Division (IOD)</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: IOD's machine shop is a mixture of manual and programmable Computer Numerical Control (CNC) mills, lathes, water jets, and press brakes. The ALC desires to tighten configuration management of CNC programs while at the same time addressing capacity and planning constraints within the shop.</p>
<p>CNC programs are currently developed by IOD's Computer Aided Design (CAD)/Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) shop and transferred to the machine by hard drive. The Aviation Technical Information Management System (ATIMS) is ALC's technical data repository and the storage of programs on hard drives and the machines creates a traceability risk.</p>
<p>IOD's machine shop is capacity constrained. A significant portion of the work is simple components with no commercial source of supply. Outsourcing this work will increase IOD's effective capacity without investment. Depending on the component, several forms of technical data are generated, but all components are quality checked against an approved 2D print.</p>
<p>ALC repairs and fabricates thousands of unique components. The current Information Technology (IT) system does not allow for tracking of material and tooling requirements for each job or shop inventory. Without a job management tool, labor hours are wasted tracking material and days lost when the material needs to be ordered.</p>
<p>Current Manufacturing Equipment:</p>
<p><strong>Nomenclature&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manufacturer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model Number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serial Number</strong><br />Press Brake&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cincinnati&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90MX6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 55265<br /><br />Water jet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Omax&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 55100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B512041<br />Water jet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Omax&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2652&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A511966<br /><br />Milling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TM-1 A1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1075198<br />Milling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TM-1 B1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1075197<br />Milling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VM-3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1085706<br />Milling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VF-5/40XT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1085515<br /><br />Lathe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TL-25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3079376<br />Lathe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardinge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quest 65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 207<br />Lathe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SL-10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3083802<br />Lathe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TL-1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3084269</p>

As allowed by FAR 13.106-2(b)(1), the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) selection process shall be applied. Award will be made to the vendor who is deemed responsible and responsive, and represents the best value to the government based on selection of the lowest evaluated price that is deemed technically acceptable. To be eligible for award, a quotation must meet all technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, and provide all information required. The three lowest priced quotes will then be evaluated on technical acceptability. The technical area will be evaluated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. If all evaluated vendors are deemed overall "acceptable" in technical, the award will be made to the lowest price.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.</p>
<p>A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.</p>
<p>When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>
<p>If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer.</p>
<p><br />The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation:</p>
<p>FAR 52.252-1: Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998)<br />This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer.

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> 2 July 2015 <br>  <br> SUBJECT:  Solicitation No.:  W56JSR-15-R-0039; Request for Quotes (RFQ) <br>  <br> This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for HP FORTIFY BRAND NAME COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE LICENSES / MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and Subpart 5.207, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice, this announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  The word Government in this document refers to the United States Government, its authorized Agencies, Departments, Representatives, Personnel and Assigns only. <br>  <br>  <br> 1.  This combined synopsis/solicitation, W56JSR-15-R-0039, is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). These requirements will result in Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contracts for Commercial Off- the-Shelf (COTS) software licenses and software maintenance/support agreements. <br>  <br> 2.  This combined synopsis/solicitation will be continuously amended through the end of federal fiscal year 2015 (30 Sept. 2015). New requirements will be added as they arise. Requirements will be removed from this combined synopsis/solicitation for award after a sufficient quantity of technically acceptable price quotes for competition have been received. Each addition or removal of requirements will prompt a new amended version of the combined synopsis/solicitation posted to FedBizOpps. <br>  <br> 3.  The government reserves the right to make one award or multiple awards (separating the numbered requirements below) based on the results of the price evaluation of the technically acceptable companies that respond to the solicitation. The numbered requirements below (Section 7) are each intended for award to a single Offeror. Award of each requirement will be made to the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) submitted price quote. An Offeror may receive award for each requirement that it submitted the LPTA price quote, but only for those requirements where its price quote was the LPTA submission. The Government reserves the right to make no award if the requirement is cancelled, there are insufficient funds, or the contracting officer cannot determine the quoted prices to be fair and reasonable. <br>  <br> 4.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular effective 8 June 2015. <br>  <br> 5.  In the event that reasonable and acceptable quotes are received from two or more businesses meeting the Small Business size standard for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code declared for a requirement, that requirement may be set-aside for award to small business. In accordance with FAR 19.1405(b), if two or more reasonable and acceptable quotes are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), that requirement will be set-aside for award to a SDVOSB. Award will be made for that particular requirement to the responsible small business whose price quote is determined technically acceptable and provides the lowest price. In accordance with FAR 19.1307, in full and open competitions a price evaluation preference of 10% will be assessed for HUBZone small businesses. The Government reserves the right to apply any applicable socio-economic small business set aside or sole source option based upon industry responses that are deemed fully responsive and fully technically competent.  Otherwise, award will be made to the Offeror whose quote is deemed the lowest priced technically acceptable offer. <br>  <br> 6.  REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONS/ QUANTITIES/ DELIVERY DATES  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army, an agency of the Government, intends to procure the following (1) requirement(s) for (COTS) Software Licensing/Maintenance Support Renewal Agreements.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced or if requested options are not priced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br> (c)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the office designated in this contract to receive that information (hereafter: &ldquo;designated office&rdquo;) by _______________ [<em>the Contracting Officer shall insert date, days after award, days before first request, the date specified for receipt of offers if the provision at </em></span><a href="https://acquisition.gov/far/current/html/52_232.html#wp1153462"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">52.232-38</span></a><em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;"> is utilized, or &ldquo;concurrent with first request&rdquo; as prescribed by the head of the agency; if not prescribed, insert &ldquo;no later than 15 days prior to submission of the first request for payment&rdquo;</span></em><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">]. If not otherwise specified in this contract, the payment office is the designated office for receipt of the Contractor&rsquo;s EFT information. If more than one designated office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the designated office(s).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the designated office. However, EFT information supplied to a designated office shall be applicable only to contracts that identify that designated office as the office to receive EFT information for that contract.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(c) <em>Mechanisms for EFT payment</em>. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(d) Suspension of payment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(1) The Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractor&rsquo;s request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor&rsquo;s EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(f) <em>EFT and prompt payment</em>. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(g) <em>EFT and assignment of claims</em>.

In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(h) <em>Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent</em>. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor&rsquo;s financial agent.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(i) <em>Payment information</em>. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;">(j) <em>EFT information</em>. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 4;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 6;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 6;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror&rsquo;s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</span></p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(ii) Examples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

In other words, the Government may elect to have a quote revision date for an offeror that is different than the quote revision date for another offeror(s). The Government need not conduct communications with all offerors. Rather, the Government may, at its discretion, conduct communications with one or only some offerors. Furthermore, the Government need not permit all offerors to submit quote revisions. Rather, the Government may, at its discretion, seek quote revisions from only one or only some offerors.</p>
<p>12. Evaluation Methodology: The Government will perform a comparative analysis of quotes and will assess the advantages and disadvantages of each quote as related to the Evaluation Factors.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (Jul 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>As prescribed in 204.1105, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the provision at FAR 52.204-7:<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through this date. <br /><br /><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</strong> <br /><br /><strong>Background<br /></strong>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Neuronal Cytoskeletal Protein Regulation Section's (NCPRS) core mission involves studying the mechanisms of topographic regulation of neuronal cytoskeletal proteins regulated by phosphorylation and neurodegenerations. Understanding these mechanisms relies heavily on ability to utilize centrifugation techniques. The NCPRS requires centrifuges that have new technological developments in order to advance research and optimize protocols.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose<br /></strong>The purpose of this potential requirement is acquisition of a high performance centrifuge, benchtop, a microfuge, and an ultra-centrifuge to advance NCPRS research and optimize protocols.<br /><strong><br />Project Requirements<br /></strong>The NINDS NCPRS requires one (1) high performance centrifuge, one (1) benchtop microfuge, and one (1) ultra-centrifuge.<br /><br /><strong>A. The high performance centrifuge must meet the following requirements:<br /><br /></strong>1. The centrifuge must allow dual temperature control with capability to monitor sample temperature in the rotor and in the chamber.<br />2. The centrifuge must have mobile connectivity capability that provides diagnostic run alerts and real time data to app or phone, and allows scientists the ability leave the instrument while it is running samples. <br />3. The centrifuge must have aluminum alloy rotors.<br />4. The centrifuge must offer the ability to load rotor empty into the centrifuge, as well as have the ability to load with samples if desired. <br />5. The centrifuge must come with a foot pedal to allow hands-free use.<br />6. The centrifuge must be capable of using multiple levels of rotor identification, including Dynamic Rotor Inertia Check and Auto ID.<br />7. The centrifuge must be capable of running swinging bucket rotors for gradients, as well as fixed angle rotors.<br />8. The centrifuge must be able to hold a temperature of 4 degrees Celsius when spinning at top speeds. It is imperative for NINDS samples that the temperature not fall below this figure. <br />9. The centrifuge must have a large touchscreen which provides ability to see the centrifuge from a distance and the touchscreen must be usable while scientists are wearing gloves. <br />10. The centrifuge must have multi-level password protection capability. <br />11. The centrifuge must fit a bench space of 34 inches tall and 28 inches wide. The safety clearance must fit within this space as well. <br /><br /><strong>B. The benchtop and microfuge must meet the following requirements:<br /><br /></strong>1. The microfuge must be capable of reaching a minimum of 20,000 x g for our spin columns.<br />2. The microfuge must hold at least 36 samples.<br />3. The benchtop safety clearance must be capable of fitting on a bench top space that is 20 inches wide. <br />4. The benchtop must have a minimum of a 400 mL bucket capacity to accommodate 15/50 mL cell culture samples. The buckets must be bio certified and use screw-on lids.<br />5. The microfuge must have a fixed angle rotor that can achieve a minimum of 28,000 x g to pellet homogenates.<br /><br /><strong>C. The ultra-centrifuge must meet all of the requirements of the high performance centrifuge detailed above as well as the following additional requirements:<br /><br /></strong>1. The ultra-centrifuge will frequently be used overnight for long runs such as fifteen hours. The centrifuge must, therefore, have alloy and titanium rotors that are safe, temperature stable (conductive) and a low k factor for high efficiency. <br />2. The ultra-centrifuge must have a full vacuum which removes all air from the chamber, preventing the samples from increasing in temperature, as well as a friction reduction system and switched reluctance system to shorten runs, reduce heat dissipation, and ensure less wear and tear on our centrifuge and samples. <br />3. The ultra-centrifuge must not require use of a computer in addition to the touchscreen.<br />4. The ultra-centrifuge must not have any doors or parts of internal workings extending beyond the body of the equipment. <br />5. The ultra-centrifuge must have regenerative breaking, idle powering, and low decibel level capabilities. <br /><br /><strong>Period of Performance<br /></strong>The Contractor shall deliver and install the required equipment within eight (8) weeks after receipt of order. The equipment shall be delivered between the hours of 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Bethesda, MD local prevailing time, Monday through Friday.<br /><br /><strong>Contract Type<br /></strong>The Government intends to issue a firm fixed price purchase order for this requirement.<br /><br /><strong>APPLICABLE CLAUSES AND PROVISIONS<br /></strong>All Offerors MUST be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.<br /><br />The provision at FAR clause 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.<br /><br />FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.<br /><br />A completed copy of the provision at FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, is required with any offer submitted. This requirement may be met by completion of the provision in the System for Award Management. <br /><br />FAR clauses 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items and 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial items apply to this acquisition. <br /><br />The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) are not applicable to this requirement. <br /><br /><strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA<br /></strong>FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition and the specific evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of that provision are as follows: <br /><br />The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation on the basis of best value, technical factors and price considered.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200190 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-83 effective 2 July 2015.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded on a competitive basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following parts:<br /><br />ELEMENT, FILTER<br />P/N: 4330-14-443-9078<br />NSN: CH0913101331A00<br />QTY: 50 EA<br />MFGCD: F0559<br />RDD: 02/27/2016</p>
<p>All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Sofrance (Cage Code F0559). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, or a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  2 July 2015  <br>    <br>  SUBJECT:  Solicitation No.:  W56JSR-15-R-0039; Request for Quotes (RFQ)  <br>    <br>  This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for HP FORTIFY BRAND NAME COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE LICENSES / MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and Subpart 5.207, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice, this announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  The word Government in this document refers to the United States Government, its authorized Agencies, Departments, Representatives, Personnel and Assigns only.  <br>    <br>    <br>  1.  This combined synopsis/solicitation, W56JSR-15-R-0039, is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ). These requirements will result in Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contracts for Commercial Off- the-Shelf (COTS) software licenses and software maintenance/support agreements.  <br>    <br>  2.  This combined synopsis/solicitation will be continuously amended through the end of federal fiscal year 2015 (30 Sept. 2015). New requirements will be added as they arise. Requirements will be removed from this combined synopsis/solicitation for award after a sufficient quantity of technically acceptable price quotes for competition have been received. Each addition or removal of requirements will prompt a new amended version of the combined synopsis/solicitation posted to FedBizOpps.  <br>    <br>  3.  The government reserves the right to make one award or multiple awards (separating the numbered requirements below) based on the results of the price evaluation of the technically acceptable companies that respond to the solicitation. The numbered requirements below (Section 7) are each intended for award to a single Offeror. Award of each requirement will be made to the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) submitted price quote. An Offeror may receive award for each requirement that it submitted the LPTA price quote, but only for those requirements where its price quote was the LPTA submission. The Government reserves the right to make no award if the requirement is cancelled, there are insufficient funds, or the contracting officer cannot determine the quoted prices to be fair and reasonable.  <br>    <br>  4.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular effective 8 June 2015.  <br>    <br>  5.  In the event that reasonable and acceptable quotes are received from two or more businesses meeting the Small Business size standard for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code declared for a requirement, that requirement may be set-aside for award to small business. In accordance with FAR 19.1405(b), if two or more reasonable and acceptable quotes are received from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), that requirement will be set-aside for award to a SDVOSB. Award will be made for that particular requirement to the responsible small business whose price quote is determined technically acceptable and provides the lowest price. In accordance with FAR 19.1307, in full and open competitions a price evaluation preference of 10% will be assessed for HUBZone small businesses. The Government reserves the right to apply any applicable socio-economic small business set aside or sole source option based upon industry responses that are deemed fully responsive and fully technically competent.  Otherwise, award will be made to the Offeror whose quote is deemed the lowest priced technically acceptable offer.  <br>    <br>  6.

Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  <br>  (c)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  <br>    <br>  9.

Registration information can be found at www.sam.gov. <BR> <BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:
DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE- ALL ITEMS DELIVERED WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror?s proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government?s required delivery schedule as follows:
REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE-ALL ITEMS DELIVERED WITHIN 90 DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply. OFFEROR?S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE--PLEASE UPLOAD PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE (b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor?s date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term ?working day? excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.
(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>Question from vendor: Will alternate tank materials such as steel be accepted?
Answer: No steel is not what we were hoping for.  Because of the very caustic water in the pipeline system, steel tanks do not last in this location and the livestock grazing permittee has specifically requested fiberglass. <BR> <BR>Question:Above or below ground
Answer: The tanks will be above ground <BR> <BR>Question: Can you please confirm if the delivery site has the capabilities to offload the tank from the delivery truck
Answer: Delivery Location is off of US Hwy 380 (two lane US Hwy with shoulders) as indicated on the maps.  The truck has to cross a cattle-guard or gate that is locked (must arrange for access), I am guessing 14 to 16 foot width gate and/or cattle-guard.  Vendor is responsible for off-loading without damage to the tanks. <BR> <BR>1) Is a post-cure required, since it is a potable water tank?      The Specs say "Potable water construction style" implying one piece tank not delivered in pieces and assembled onsite, the tanks do not have to be certified for potable water, this is for a livestock water system.  Post-curing was not itemized in the specs, but it is typically part of proper tank manufacturing of single piece filament wound construction it needs to occur to ensure structural integrity of the tanks.  Again these are only intended for water, however, the water quality is so poor fiberglass was selected over other tank materials.
2) Is a 100 mil corrosion liner required?
No liner separate of the tank construction of fiberglass is required, again this does not have to be certified for potable water.
3) Is the manway on the top or the side?
Preferably located on the side (but not mandatory on the side in the specs), because of the height of the upright construction (dimensions) a side access is more practical and safe.
4) Shall the tanks be designed for wind and Seismic loads?
Yes, that was part of the reasoning behind requiring three eyebolt tie downs for anchoring on the top. 
5) Shall the fabrication be ASME RTP-1 certified?
No, the fabrication does not need to be ASME RTP-1 certified, per the specs.  Additional corrosion protection is not necessary.  Again these are only intended for water, however, the water quality is so poor fiberglass was selected over other tank materials.
6) Are top ribs required, and if so must they be designed per ASTM 3299/4097?
Top ribs were included in specs due to market research indicating that was common practice in fabrication.  Also allows for strength in lifting and tie-down anchoring for wind.
7) What warranties are required by the manufacturer?
Minimum required 1 year manufactures warranty.
8) If bidder is not the OEM, what warranty bonds are required to ensure warranty coverage?
Minimum required 1 year manufactures warranty. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(local time) except for Federal Holidays. Deliveries will be accepted on regular scheduled work days between 7:00 A.M. and 4:30 P.M. (local time). The following Federal Holidays are observed: (a) January 1st (f) 1st Monday in September (b) 3rd Monday in January (g) 2nd Monday in October (c) 3rd Monday in February (h) November 11th (d) Last Monday in May (i) 4th Thursday in November (e) July 4th (j) December 25th When any of the above holidays fall on a Sunday, the following Monday will be observed as the holiday; when a holiday falls on a Friday or Saturday the preceding Thursday is observed as the holiday. <BR> <BR>Access to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) requires that Contractor employees voluntarily submit personal data (e.g., name, social security number, etc.) when applying for a DPG Identification Card or temporary access pass. This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground. Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor. It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>(a) In accordance with Section 326 of P.L. 102-484, the Government is prohibited from awarding any contract which includes a specification or standard that requires the use of a Class I ozone-depleting substance (ODS) identified in Section 602(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 767a(a)), or that can be met only through the use of such a substance unless such use has been approved, on an individual basis, by a senior acquisition official who determines that there is no suitable substitute available. (b) To comply with this statute, the Government has conducted a best efforts screening of the specifications and standards associated with this acquisition to determine whether they contain any ODS requirements. To the extent that ODS requirements were revealed by this review, they are identified in Section C or the statement of work of this document. (c) If offerors possess any special knowledge about any other ODS required directly or indirectly at any level of contract performance, the U.S. Army would appreciated if such information was surfaced to the Contracting Officer for appropriate action. To preclude delay to the procurement, offerors should provide any information as soon as possible after release of the solicitation and prior to the submission of offers to the extent practicable. It should be understood that there is no obligation on offerors to comply with this request and that no compensation can be provided for doing so. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile Number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FEDEX or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft.

The main gate is approximately 90 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. Contractors may be required to travel up to 150 miles one way from Salt Lake City to reach some work sites. <BR> <BR>Contractors with valid U.S. government contracts will be allowed to hire non U.S. citizens to work at or visit U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during performance of the contract.

A bath of sufficient size, stability, cooling capacity, uniformity and functionality is required for this effort. The bath must be engineered with automatic digital controls and incorporate active stirring to achieve the required temperature uniformity.</p>
<p>An extra deep tank is a key requirement for the bath. Refrigeration capacity must be sufficient to cool to a minimum of -70 &deg;C. Dual cell capacity necessitates a rectangular access opening of the below specified dimensions. The bath should be capable of both front panel manual operation and remote operation over standard interfaces. An integrated design with all components combined into a single unit is strongly preferred. The compressor should be balanced and shock mounted to reduce vibration to acceptably low levels.</p>

The offeror shall demonstrate relevant past performance or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance.  Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts (within the past three years) considering the same or similar scope and magnitude (e.g., performing services of a dollar value comparable to the dollar value of the offerors quote) to that which is described in the solicitation. 

To demonstrate its past performance, the offeror shall identify up to two (2) of its most relevant contracts or efforts within the past three (3) years, and provide any other information the offeror considers relevant to the requirements of the solicitation.
  Offerors should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts or efforts to the requirements of the solicitation.  If subcontractor experience is provided as part of the TWO most relevant contracts, it will be given weight relative to the percentage of effort being provided by that particular subcontractor in the offer submitted.

The offeror should complete a Past Performance Information Form for each reference submitted.  The form is an attachment to the solicitation.  The forms will count toward the Volume I page limit described above.  For additional information regarding a particular reference beyond that which will fit on the form, the offeror may continue onto another sheet of paper.  Such continuation sheet(s) for submitted references will count toward the Volume I page limit.

<p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This announcement is 100% set-aside for Small Businesses only. The Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires the services of Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms for a minimum of one and a maximum of two, Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for Construction Management Services. These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act, as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence for the required work. Offerors are cautioned to read this announcement in its entirety. The contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by the Savannah District for use on projects under its jurisdiction and, if requested, for other Corps of Engineers District s within the South Atlantic Division - Area of Responsibility (SAD-AOR). Contracts may be issued up to one year after selection approval. Typically, the contracts will consist of a 3 year base with a 2 year option period for a total of five years maximum. The total amount of the contracts over the five-year ordering period may not exceed $8,000,000. Task Orders will be primarily for Construction Management Services. These task orders are firm fixed price. These task orders are firm fixed price. Projects to be assigned are not yet determined and funds are not presently available. Assignment of individual task orders to the contracts with identical scopes of work will be based on the following factors: (1) Performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC, (2) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the task order in the required time, and (3) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541330 with a size standard of $15 million. The firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Register via the SAM Internet at http://www.fsd.gov or by contacting the SAM Customer Service Desk at 1-866-606-8220.</p>
<p>Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CMS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: Construction management services are required to support construction management activities for construction contracts at military installations throughout the Savannah District. These installations can include Ft Bragg, Ft Gordon, Ft Jackson, Ft Stewart, Ft Benning, Ft. Gillem, Moody AFB, Hunter AAF, Seymour Johnson AFB, Robins AFB, and other installations as required. Required services include a broad range of engineering and construction activities including (but not limited to) assistance and guidance to field offices, construction QA inspection and reporting, review of contract documents and shop drawings, review of NAS schedules and QC plans, and investigation and reporting of construction contractor claims. The firm selected will be required to provide personnel on site for a period of 30 days to 3 years. The maximum numbers of assignees are estimated to be 20 personnel simultaneously. No travel/per diem funds will be provided. Therefore, it is suggested that existing local staff or local hires be used to perform required services.</p>
<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this project are listed below in descending order of importance. Proposals will be evaluated on each of the criteria factors listed below. Each factor will be assigned a rating from outstanding to unsatisfactory, based on the risk to the government that the offeror will successfully perform the factor being evaluated. An overall consensus rating will be given to each submission. Award will be made to the firm determined to be most highly qualified. Factors listed below will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows: Significantly More Important - means that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor. More Important - means that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater. Equal - means that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor. For this solicitation, Factor 1 (Specialized Experience and Technical Competence), and Factor 2 (Construction Management Placement Plan/Capacity) are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Factor 3 (Professional Qualifications of Management Personnel), Factor 4 (Past Performance), Factor 5 (Knowledge of Locality), and Factor 6 (Geographic Proximity) and significantly more important than Factor 7 (Volume of Work). Professional Qualifications, Past Performance, Knowledge of Locality, and Geographic Proximity are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than&nbsp; Volume of DOD Contract Awards. Volume of DOD Contract Awards will only be used as a "tie-breaker" among firms that are essentially technically equal. Information on each factor should be submitted FOR THE OFFICE AND/OR EMPLOYEE PERFORMING THE WORK IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. It is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office. If more than one office is represented, this must be stated clearly in the work management plan and the Selection Board will consider the performance risk associated with that team not being co-located and the geographical proximity to the supported projects</p>
<p>**** FACTOR 1 - SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: Specialized experience and technical competence in hiring, managing, and supervising personnel (in descending order of importance within this category): a. Construction quality assurance inspections and reporting. b. Review of construction contract documents. c. Review of contractor submittals including shop drawings. d.

These include Savannah, GA; Atlanta, GA; Augusta, GA; Warner Robins, GA; Valdosta, GA; Columbia, SC; Fayetteville, NC; Southport, NC; and Goldsboro, NC. The plan shall address the firm's capacity to provide staff for a period of 30 days to 3 years to accomplish multiple simultaneous task orders to include approximately $5,000,000 of work of the required type in a one year period. The evaluation will consider the experience of the firm and consultants in similar contracts, and the availability of an adequate number of personnel in key disciplines. Key disciplines in descending order of importance are civil, mechanical, electrical, scheduling, claims, structural, cost, environmental, and architecture. No travel/per diem funds will be provided. Therefore, it is suggested that existing local staff or local hires be used to perform required services.</p>
<p>****FACTOR 3 - PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS OF MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL: All key management personnel shall be shown on the organizational chart in Section D of SF 330. Resumes shall be provided for these key management personnel in Section E of SF 330. Resumes will address all professional qualifications of key management personnel.</p>
<p>****FACTOR 4 - PAST PERFORMANCE: Past performance on DOD and other contracts with respect to quality of work, compliance with performance schedules and cost control. Indication of favorable performance ratings, awards, and repeat clientele in Section H of SF 330 is recommended. Past performance will be based on CPARS/ACASS ratings and other data presented by the offeror or as determined by the Government.

All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Zodiac Aerosafety Systems France (Cage Code F6101). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.  

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  
Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, or a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems.  Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the USCG H-65 aircraft. 

The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15.  COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All parts shall be NEW approved parts.

Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to the manufacturer, manufacturer's COC and its own COC to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on USCG aircraft.  Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor.  Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.  

Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.  For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as "bullpenners," providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Operations Advisor is a key position in a busy office that responds rapidly to crisis situations. It is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. To achieve this, OTI relies on Operations Advisors who have the capacity to work well within a team environment, provide necessary support to a team, and anticipate the needs of a complex organizational unit. A common characteristic among OTI staff is that they are operationally-minded, enjoy working in a fast-paced environment, and seek innovative ways to improve efficiency and effectiveness of operations support and programs.</p>
<p>The Operations Advisor is experienced in the multitude of functions that comprise program operations for OTI programs, and provides services that require professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy and operational expertise in administrative support. This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation. While most of the work will be performed in Washington, there may in rare circumstances be requirements for field travel. OTI field offices are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Operations Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><br />The current PROS contract requires vendor quotes to be valid for 60 days. There are instances when vendor quotes are higher than anticipated, forcing the FMS customer to obtain additional funding and potentially resulting in a request for the vendor to extend the timeframe of their quote. Anecdotal data suggests that it may require FMS customers more than 60 days to amend their case in order to add funding. To account for this possibility, the USG is considering revising the vendor quote validity requirement from 60 to 90 days. Please identify what impacts, if any, this revision would have upon your proposal.</p>
<p><br />Responses to this question should be submitted in writing to Ms. Tamara Tobe, Contract Specialist, at tamara.tobe@us.af.mil by 12:00pm Eastern on Friday, February 27. Non-responses will not negatively impact an offeror's eligibility.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">****************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE. </span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide acquisition services for non-standard and difficult to purchase standard items in support of foreign military sales. This tri-service contract will support FMS Air Force, Navy and Army requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Effort Description: The Parts Repair Ordering System (PROS) Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor's performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing, quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer. The PROS program goal is to provide "one stop shopping" for the FMS country. The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), period of performance June 2012 - June 2017 (3-year base period with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), firm fixed price and cost reimbursable (task orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and an Objective Performance Incentive (OPI) . NOTE: The contemplated period of performance for this acquisition is 5-7 years, with a 3-6 month ramp up period to create and implement a procurement software system capable of interfacing with AFSAC's Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS), along with a logistics transition phase between the current and subsequent contractor. Government requests industry feedback on contemplated Period of Performance (PoP) and suggested ramp up period required in order for USG to solicit realistic time frames.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical Environment: Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The 90+ plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure rates. The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate computations make predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) supported on this contract are waived by the USAF for supply action usually due to inability to meet an established need date. However, the managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved sources. Approximately 22,000 supply requisitions and 4,500 maintenance requisitions are issued per year. Approximately 80% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being maintenance and task orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service. The majority of the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service. The successful bidder for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the contract. The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and OPI. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have been completed several years before. The successful bidder shall be advised to make arrangements to address this potential liability. <br />NOTE: The SDR process has been problematic in previous contracts. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract value amount is pass-through costs for procuring required parts and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desirable Features: Competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance; current contract contains a 90% effective competition rate. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings - best available price - minimizing participation fees, turn-around time - shortest possible lead-time - lead-time from after receipt of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Small business and other than small business participation is encouraged. Each company responding should indicate their business size in relation to the stated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code size standard. The NAICS assigned to this acquisition is 541614, "Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting", with a size standard of $15M. Your response must also indicate all socio-economic small business categories for which you qualify; small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. If you are a Small Business and you intend to subcontract a portion of this effort, please explain in your response how you intend to meet the 50% performance requirement. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit capability packages that outline their capability to provide the required purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. Additionally, interested firms should specifically state how they intend to meet the 3-6 month ramp up after contract award and discuss their capability to be fully operational within that time frame. Also, include any comments/suggestions on structuring SDR liability and resolution. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience and/or capabilities in all areas should be provided. Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar work within the past three (3) years. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 10 pages. Submit capabilities packages via e-mail to Tammy Tobe; tamara.tobe@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Parts Ordering Repair Service-PROS." If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions related to this sources sought synopsis must be submitted via e-mail to the person indicated above NLT COB (Monday, 28 July 2014.) No further questions will be entertained after that date.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN COB Monday, 18 August 2014.<br />The PROS Program Management Office (PMO) will be hosting an Industry Days event for all interested parties. Information about Industry Days will be posted as a separate notice.</span></p>

<DESC>The DoD Army Contracting Command- Warren, DTA, in a combined effort with the Vehicle and Robotics Alliance Program Office, within TARDEC, is seeking to expand through collaboration of various DoD Agencies, its Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) related opportunities, that include local, state and national level initiatives that provide educational opportunities for K to 12 students.     <br>    <br>  The Government is seeking an established consortium or other entity with a collective expertise of academia, industry, non-profit, and others with STEM expertise.  The purpose of the organization or entity is to provide a single point of management for STEM activities for the DoD agencies.  This organization will be responsible for the execution of STEM initiatives that are managed by the Vehicle and Robotics Alliance members (a collection of DoD organizations).    The Government will provide an annual STEM Engagement Plan outlining STEM activities and initiatives the Government would like to pursue.  The STEM initiative topic areas can originate from other agencies providing funding, not limited to the DoD Army and TARDEC, and efforts will be geographically dispersed (nation-wide).    <br>    <br>  The DoD Army-Army Contracting Command-Warren, DTA, in coordination with the Vehicle and Robotics Alliance Program Office, is seeking to obtain STEM related training, support, assessment and evaluation services of new and existing initiatives, activities and projects, in which the Government would evaluate and consider and provide to the single point of management for STEM activities for award opportunities.

<DESC>Source Sought Synopsis  <br>  For   <br>  Walter Reed Caretaker Services  <br>    <br>  Source Sought Synopsis Number W9124J-15-R-0029  <br>    <br>  SYNOPSIS:   <br>    <br>  On behalf of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Division,  the Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center - Fort Sam Houston, Texas, is conducting a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS) pursuant to FAR Part 10-Market Research.  Interested sources should respond to the questions presented within this announcement.   This notice shall NOT be considered a request for proposal, quotation, or an invitation for bid.  Response to this SSS does not guarantee or exclude your participation in the forthcoming acquisition process.  Any information provided by the Government under this notice is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to release of the solicitation. The Government will NOT award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it be liable for any costs associated with preparing and submitting a response to this notice. All submissions will become Government property and will not be returned.    <br>    <br>  BACKGROUND:   <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army requires information to determine the availability of resources to provide caretaker service at the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) Installation. This Caretaker mission began at the former WRAMC Installation on 16 September 2011.  All information available at the time of publication relating to administrative responsibilities, technical responsibilities, performance requirements and workload estimates, are documented in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS).   <br>  The Government seeks to maintain the caretaker operations services for the former WRAMC Installation, until some or all remaining parcels are transferred.  Should the transfer of the Land Reuse Authority (LRA) parcel occur, during the period of performance of the contract, the contract will be modified to incorporate: A revised PWS; an implementation schedule; and revised funding for the transition and implementation of the revised PWS.  <br>    <br>  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to be responsible for performing all operations and maintenance functions to support the former WRAMC Installation.  This acquisition has historically been set aside for 8(a) small businesses; therefore, the information received from this SSS will determine, if enough competitive 8(a) vendors are available.  The information received from this SSS will be used by the Government as a preliminary planning tool for the purposes of obtaining information regarding the availability and capability of qualified 8(a) businesses under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The associated size standard is $38.5 Million as measured by total revenues. The anticipated period of performance is one Base Year of 12 months and two (2) 12-month option years.   <br>    <br>  EXISTING CONTRACT:  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army currently contracts for caretaker services with a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract vehicle.  The current contract was awarded with a one year base period and a six-month option period under Contract Number W9124J-14-C-0074, valued at more than $15M.  For informational purposes only, historical data regarding the dollar amount awarded under the current contract may be found on www.fpds.gov.  <br>    <br>  This required was previously put in the 8(a) program therefore in accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(3)(i), in order to determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency need exists, the Government will consider SSS responses received from all 8(a)'s.  Responses to this SSS permit the contracting officer, in accordance with FAR 19.203(c), to consider rather there are enough 8(a) concerns to allow for competition.  Provide suggestions on how the requirement could be structured to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns. Describe any conditions, if any that may limit small businesses from participation.  <br>    <br>  SUBMITTAL INFORMATION:  <br>    <br>  The Government will not review general capability statements, please ensure submissions are tailored to this requirement and information requested below.

The VA is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.

Contiguous space is preferred.

For this requirement, VA will only consider expressions of interest for an existing space for lease.  

The building and parking area must be fully accessible, meeting all requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards.

<DESC>A construction contract is awarded for repair and painting of seven (7) Tainter Gates, one (1) bulkhead lifting beam, and other miscellaneous appurtenant metal components at Cheatham Dam located on the Cumberland River near Ashland City, TN.<br />The Tainter Gates are 27'x60' gates with skin plate on the Upstream and Downstream face. All seven gates have similar deterioration and will require replacement of a substantial number of bolts and rivets, replacement of all side seals (rubber), member replacement in the lower section of the gate, installation of an access hatch on the top of the gate, straightening or build-up of the lower seal and other miscellaneous<br />metal repairs. Currently the interior of the gates are coated with coal tar epoxy and the exterior with a vinyl paint system. All structural components have been tested for lead based paint and positive results were attained on numerous components. Hence the contractor shall plan for hazardous waste removal and disposal. The gates will be repainted with similar paint systems.<br />The spillway bulkhead lifting beam will require member straightening, minor welding, and bolt replacement.&nbsp; The spillway bulkhead lifting beam shall be blasted and repainted with a vinyl paint system similar to the exterior of the Tainter Gates.<br />All work will be performed on-site. Government furnished spillway bulkheads shall be placed upstream and downstream of the Tainter Gates for the duration of the repair and painting operations. Placement of the spillway bulkheads will require marine plant and will be the responsibility of the contractor. The contractor may be required to install downstream bulkhead seal angles via the use of divers. All work will be performed on-site.&nbsp; The existing spillway bulkheads allow for unwatering of one gate bay only. A second set of spillway bulkheads will be procured<br />by the Government outside of this contract and will be available to the construction contractor in 2016.<br />River conditions fluctuate substantially at Cheatham Dam and the contractor may encounter periods of shutdown and / or demobilization. The construction season for this contract is from June 1 to November 30 (6 months). It is expected that ll work can be performed in 3.5 construction seasons. The length of the contract is 42 months.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&amp;A)<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Identification of the agency and the contracting activity:</strong> The Office of Acquisition Management is conducting this acquisition for renewal of licenses for AutoCAD LT drawing &amp; drafting software for Department of State owned equipment on behalf of the Telecommunication, Wireless, and Data Services Division (IRM/OPS/ENM/TWD). The estimated value of this acquisition is $4,275.50</p>
<p><strong>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved:</strong> TWD uses AutoCAD software to develop drawings of floors, network, cabling, PBX, or CER. TWD needs to renew the current licenses in use today. TWD needs to renew its licenses to continue its mission.</p>
<p><strong>3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department's needs:</strong> The Department has a requirement to renew existing software licenses to its AutoCAD drawing and drafting system. TWD Cabling, Network, Voice, and Project Managers use AutoCAD to draw the diagrams of floors, network PBX or CER for continuously update anytime the infrastructures change including the special projects.</p>
<p><strong>4. Justification rationale and a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service:</strong> This J&amp;A is submitted under FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for brand-name descriptions. The required items are licenses to proprietary AutoCAD software already in use by the Department of State (DOS). The proprietary software support is available only from the original software manufacturer and its authorized partners, and therefore precludes consideration of any other brand.</p>
<p><strong>5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. <br /></strong>The Government is not proposing a specific contractor.
