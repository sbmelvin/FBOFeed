<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement USAID/South Africa’s (USAID/SA) new Integrated Education Program (IEP) which is targeted to improve access to quality education for South Africa’s historically disadvantaged population.  The IEP will be implemented in the four target provinces –Eastern Cape (EC), Northern Cape (NC), KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Limpopo (LP). The Mission has developed parameters for a new primary education-focused activity that integrates and creates synergies with ongoing training and higher education activities, the IEP. The new IEP will build on the lessons learned and best practices developed over the course of the program, namely, (i) use of a holistic approach to school development, especially governance which must involve communities; (ii) emphasis on leadership development at both school and district levels; and (iii) provision of support to clusters of schools, rather than individual schools. Under the anticipated contract, the contractor will be expected to contribute to the achievement of the following key objectives in order to assist USAID/South Africa to attain the result of “improved quality of primary education,” with a specific focus on improving the system’s capacity to deliver quality math and science programs. Those objectives are:  (i) enhanced capacity of teachers (targeted to the teaching of literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science; (ii) effective implementation of Curriculum 2005 (C2005), with a focus on literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science curriculum; and (iii) improved educational management and enhanced school governance. The stated objectives are consistent with the National Department of Education (NDoE) and those of other local and international development partners. USAID/South Africa anticipates awarding one performanced based contract for a three year period using full and open competition. The government estimate is $9m with an optional 4th year for an additional amount of $3m. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Government-wide point of entry (GPE).

<DESC>THIS IS A REISSUANCE OF PRESOLICITATION NOTICE 674-03-007.  
IT IS BEING REISSUED AS NO RESPONSIVE BIDDERS WERE RECEIVED.
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement USAID/South Africa’s (USAID/SA) new Integrated Education Program (IEP) which is targeted to improve access to quality education for South Africa’s historically disadvantaged population.  The IEP will be implemented in the four target provinces:  Eastern Cape (EC), Northern Cape (NC), KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Limpopo (LP). The Mission has developed parameters for a new primary education-focused activity that integrates and creates synergies with ongoing training and higher education activities, the IEP. The new IEP will build on the lessons learned and best practices developed over the course of the program, namely, (i) use of a holistic approach to school development, especially governance which must involve communities; (ii) emphasis on leadership development at both school and district levels; and (iii) provision of support to clusters of schools, rather than individual schools. Under the anticipated contract, the contractor will be expected to contribute to the achievement of the following key objectives in order to assist USAID/South Africa to attain the result of improved quality of primary education, with a specific focus on improving the system’s capacity to deliver quality math and science programs. Those objectives are: (i) enhanced capacity of teachers (targeted to the teaching of literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science; (ii) effective implementation of Curriculum 2005 (C2005), with a focus on literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science curriculum; and (iii) improved educational management and enhanced school governance. The stated objectives are consistent with the National Department of Education (NDoE) and those of other local and international development partners. USAID/South Africa anticipates awarding one performance based contract for a three year period using full and open competition. The government estimate is $23m with an additional $5.6 pending.  The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Government-wide point of entry (GPE).

<DESC>The VA intends to award a firm-fixed price contract for the development and processing the HIPAA compliant claims.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates the Health Administration Center (HAC), which processes healthcare transactions for a variety of health benefits programs administered by VA.  The programs covered include Fee Basis Care, Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA), Spina Bifida Health Care (SB) and Children of Women Vietnam Veterans Healthcare (CWVV) programs.  CHAMPVA, SB and CWVV programs are administered by the HAC, Denver, Colorado.  The VA Fee Basis Care program is a national program managed by approximately 170 individual VA Medical Centers.  HAC intends to develop the ability to conduct healthcare transactions via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) utilizing the electronic commerce standards as set forth under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996.  HAC intends to utilize the expertise of one or more clearinghouses to develop HIPAA compliant solutions. Background HAC administers several health benefits programs.  The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) is VA’s health benefits program developed for dependents of permanently and totally disabled veterans, survivors of veterans who died from service-connected conditions, or who at the time of death, were rated permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected disability.  HAC also administers the Spina Bifida and Children of Women Vietnam Veterans programs.  HAC’s role has been expanded to include administration of other VA healthcare programs relating to veteran’s benefits.  HAC would use Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) software to convert data to and from HIPAA-mandated standards (ANSI X12 Transaction Sets (TS) version 4010A and the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) Telecommunications versions 5.1 and 1.1 standards formats) and proprietary formats.  HAC’s use of  clearinghouse services would include translation capabilities as needed to supplement HAC’s translation functionalities and data transmission through the clearinghouse to disseminate transactions to the appropriate destination.  Estimated claim activity, based upon fiscal year 2002 data, for each program is: ·	CHAMPVA:  8,000 inpatient and 560,000 outpatient annual claims ·	Spina Bifida Program:  200 inpatient claims and 18,000 outpatient annual claims ·	Children of Women Vietnam Veterans (CWVV):  8 individuals enrolled (Program began in FY2003 with no claim activity reported) NonVA-Fee Care:  487,000 inpatient and 1,4000,000 outpatient annual claims.  These totals encompass claims as grouped days of care.

<DESC>The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) is the Department of Defense (DoD) demonstration and validation (Dem/Val) program for environmental technologies. The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving proposals for environmen tal technologies that address DoD requirements. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Proposers should state in their proposal that it is submitted in response to this BAA. Readers should note that th is is an announcement to declare ESTCPÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to competitively fund demonstration and validation projects for innovative and new environmental technologies that address the selective topic areas described in the ESTCP Program Announcement. The Progr am Announcement can be found on the ESTCP Home Page accessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.estcp.org/. No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards will take the form of contracts . Before preparing a proposal, potential proposers should read the information provided in the ESTCP Program Announcement (http://www.estcp.org/opportunities/solicitations/index.cfm) for details regarding the programÃ¢Â€Â™s objectives, proposal submission requirements, the evaluation of proposals, and the individual topic areas. ESTCP is seeking proposals for environmental technologies in the following topics only: 1) Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) Detection, Discrimination, and Remediation, 2) Characterization,  Control, and Treatment of Range Contamination, or 3) Remediation of Contaminated Groundwater. ESTCP is seeking these proposals as candidates for funding beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2005. Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage rev iew process. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal white paper, including a signed original, plus five additional copies, referencing this BAA, to: Ms. Brenda Batch, ESTCP Program Offic e, 901 North Stuart Street, Suite 303, Arlington, VA 22203-1821 (703-696-2127). White papers must be received no later than 4:00 PM EST on Thursday, March 11, 2004. It is strongly recommended that pre-proposal white papers be sent via overnight carrier or certified mail to document and ensure receipt. Pre-proposal white papers sent via fax or electronic mail will be rejected. Pre-proposal white papers should be no longer than five pages, not including the cover page, single-sided, and a font no smaller than  11 point. All margins (top, bottom, left and right) should not be less than 1 inch. One attachment of up to three single-sided pages of test data may also be submitted. The cover page should be in the format specified in the ESTCP Program Announcement (se e above). The pre-proposal white paper must concisely describe what technology the proposer has to offer ESTCP, including its level of development or maturity, and its cost/benefit. The pre-proposal white paper should use the following format (also describ ed in the ESTCP Program Announcement Ã¢Â€Â“ see above): 1. Short Descriptive Title: 2. ESTCP Topic Area: (i.e. UXO Detection; Characterization, Control, and Treatment of Range Contamination; or Remediation of Contaminated Groundwater) 3. Problem statement:  The specific problem the proposed technology addresses. 4. Technology Description: Describe the technology that is being proposed and the technical objective of the specific demonstration. The project description should include the following information: (a) technical description and justification of proposed technology demonstration, including a description of how the technology is innovative; (b) evidence the technology is mature enough for demonstration (include references); and (c) potential issues of concern and technical risks in taking the technology from the lab to field testing. Any limitations of the technology for different sites should be explicitly d escribed. 5. DoD Benefit: Quantitatively describe expected benefits in terms of reduced cost and risk. Assess cost/benefit per site (in terms of cost per area or volume treated) or application. Provide realistic cost/benefit estimates over existing technol ogies and approaches. Provide a basis for the expected benefit. 6. Schedule: Provide an expected schedule for the project. Explicitly describe any development, design, or treatability work required prior to actual field demonstration. 7. Cost Estimate: Pro vide an estimate for the level of funding required, including any development, design, or treatability work. Whereas identification of a specific demonstration site is not required for pre-proposals, include an estimate for the cost for a representative fi eld demonstration of the technology. 8. Performers: List all institutional performers involved in the proposed demonstration and their expected contributions. List the name and organization of the lead person(s) for each organization involved. Provide as a n attachment a one-page curriculum vitae for each of the principal performers (not included in the five page pre-proposal count). Based upon the pre-proposal white paper evaluation by the Government, a submitter may be contacted for further information and  may be encouraged to submit a full proposal by a set time and date. The format requirements for the full proposal are also set forth in the ESTCP Program Announcement (see above).  The white paper review step allows interested organizations to get initial  Government feedback on their technologies without incurring the expense of a full proposal. For those entities which are selected to provide proposals but do not have a DoD partner or a DoD demonstration site, a partner will be selected in order that a fe deral demonstration site may be identified. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor be responsible for any money  expended by the offer before contract award is made for a demonstration project. Multiple awards may be made to address a particular topic area. It is expected that awards will result totaling approximately $1.0 million for the first year of work. Pre-pro posal white papers and full proposals will be evaluated against the following factors, listed in descending order of importance: (1) ESTCP relevance (PASS/FAIL) - whether the submission responds to a DoD environmental requirement as described in the topic area; (2) readiness for demonstration/validation (Pass/Fail) - whether the proposed technology is at the appropriate stage of develop to warrant and benefit from a demonstration/validation; (3) the overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed te chnology; (4) cost/benefit of the technology; (5) potential for transition of the proposed technology; and (6) realism of the proposed cost, and availability of funds. For awards to be made as contracts, evaluation shall include the extent of commitment in  providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, HUD Zone small business, small disadvantaged business, woman owned small business concerns, historically black colleges and universities, Veteran Owned and Disabled Veteran Owned small business and minority institutions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAISC) code is 541 710 with the small business size standard of 500 employees. In addition, contract proposals that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small business c oncerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The Point of Contact for this BAA for non-technical issues is Mr. James F. Bowers, HECSA, 703-428-7406 and for technical issues is Ms. Brenda Batch, ESTCP Program Office, 703-696-2127.

<CONTACT>Don B. Terry, (202) 493-1408
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration intends to award a single source modification to contract DTFA01-01-C-00101 in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4.1.2 to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) to meet the current and future requirements of the Agency Data Telecommunications Network 2000 (ADTN2000) Program. This contract modification will increase the current contract ceiling by 3M for a total contract value of 12M with no change to the current period of performance.  It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to continue to acquire these services from this contractor on a single source basis for the following reasons: SAIC provides high quality, in-depth management, technical/engineering and security services to the FAA on the Agency Data Telecommunications Network 2000 (ADTN2000 and on other programs as requested.  SAIC personnel have supported the FAA on the ADTN2000 Program since its inception and have the most complete background, technical knowledge and experience working with the network and user community and in planning and implementing management and security systems.  No other company can offer this level of knowledge and expertise. ADTN2000 is the FAAâ€™s national and international data network serving approximately 1000 sites, over 3800 host server systems and an estimated 40,000 users.  This network, the services it provides, and all of the connected user systems, is highly complex and expansive.  Due to greatly increased network traffic volume, the unforeseen impact on ADTN2000 from user system viruses and worms and the need for more systematic management of network resources and additional security capabilities, SAICâ€™s deep technical knowledge of ADTN2000 and experience is critically required.  The FAA has a requirement to develop network intrusion quarantine capabilities using ADTN2000 as a test case.  SAICâ€™s network security expertise and knowledge of ADTN2000 is key to the success of this effort.   SAICâ€™s experience in program management support for ADTN2000 and specialized knowledge of the user communities will be pivotal during the next 2-3 years for successful transition to the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) program replacement for ADTN2000.  The current ADTN2000 contract will expire in late 2004 necessitating a highly aggressive transition schedule.  Without SAICâ€™s detailed knowledge of this very large and diverse network, the FAAâ€™s ability to accurately identify requirements, issue required orders and conduct an efficient cutover would be severely impacted.  The inevitable schedule delays would necessitate extending the period of operating dual networks thereby significantly increasing FAA costs.   Therefore, the FAA intends to solicit, negotiate and award a single source contract modification to an existing contract with SAIC for support of the ADTN2000 Program and the follow-on services.   Inquires relative to this Pubic Announcement are to be submitted in writing by 14 January 2004. They should be addresses to the Federal Aviation Administration, Attention Don B. Terry, ASU-330, 800 Independence Avenue, S.W. Washington D.C. 20591.  Facsimile number is (202) 493-5927. The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation or submittal of responses to this procurement.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to inform interested parties that the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, Maryland, intends issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-01-01-G-0128, on a sole source basis with Pioneer UAV Inc., 9 Schilling Rd, Hunt Valley, MD 21030-0738 to acquire Pioneer components consisting of payloads, receiver systems, Engines, IFF Transponders, Ground Control Stations and aircraft components (wiring harness, spars, rudders, etc.) for the Pioneer UAV System.
 
Tasks for this acquisition require detailed knowledge of the Pioneer System design, since production drawings are not available.  Accordingly, as the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the Pioneer UAV, PUI is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the Pioneer design and system architecture.  Award to any one other than PUI would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.  The estimated period of performance is February 2004 to April 2005.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to Michael.Mcloughlin@navy.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-04-162, and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This procurement is being conduced under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 8999 with a small business size standard $11.5 million.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to purchase the services of AC2993 Assay Cost for 16 patients from Esoterix Clinical Trial Services C/o Tony Perfetto 20 Lake Drive East Windsor, New Jersey. The service will be for a Base Year with two (2) option years.   

Statement of Work
Protocol: 	“Effect of AC2993 (synthetic exendin-4) administered alone or in combination with rapamycin and FK506, on islet function in patients with type 1 diabetes”
Company: 	Esoterix Inc.  Clinical Trials Services

Background information
We are studying patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).  AC2993 (synthetic exendin-4) has been shown in preclinical and in preliminary human studies to have several potentially beneficial antidiabetic actions.  We plan to study the effects of AC2993 alone, immunosuppressive drugs alone, as well as the combination of AC2993 and immunosuppressive drugs on insulin secretion and glycemia control using precise laboratory assay measures.  Esoterix Laboratories has been specified in the scientific CRADA as the lab that should run the laboratory tests for this study based on their ability to provide assay analyses that meet the protocol’s stringent scientific requirements for measures.  

Work to be done
We will study 16 patients with T1DM who have measurable circulating C peptide. We will include only patients with clear T1DM as assessed by laboratory evidence of anti-islet cell antibodies, normal insulin sensitivity, and by insulinopenia. We plan to assess endogenous islet function by performing frequent arginine stimulated C peptide tests, and will monitor anti-islet immunity by periodically monitoring anti-islet autoantibody levels and by freezing lymphocytes for subsequent T-cell assays currently being developed.  The NIH laboratory will provide peripheral blood from our patients and ship the samples to the vendor. This will be an ongoing project.  The purchase order will run for three years from the starting date listed on the purchase order.

Contractor requirements
The vendor is responsible for accepting the samples and using established scientific procedures to run samples.  This study is an official clinical trial under 21CFR Part 11.  Therefore, samples should be run at a clinical trial laboratory that can comply with 21CFR Part 11 requirements and provide a complete audit trail of all study events.  

•	Please provide data on the quality control measures for each of the samples listed above.
•	Please specify the following charges per sample:
o	Antibodies against GAD65, insulin / and ICA512/IA2
o	C-Peptide
o	Proinsulin
o	Insulin RIA
o	Insulin ICMA
o	Glucagon
o	Acetaminophen

Government responsibilities
The NIH laboratory will send the blood samples to the vendor by express shipment.  Ordinarily, we will send small numbers of samples (1-5 blood samples).  However, on occasion, we might send larger numbers of samples (for example 20-50).  These samples will be sent to the vendor when the patients are seen.  This is scheduled according to the availability of patients, and is therefore not predictable.  

Deliverables
The vendor must provide the following to the correct Government contracts:
•	Per sample reports faxed to the contract site within 24 hours (when applicable) of receipt of the sample.
•	Transfer data electronically to allow direct entry into our data base as well as comply with all issues of patient confidentiality

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) established the Accident Sequence Precursor (ASP) program in 1979.  The primary objective of this program was and continues to be the systematic evaluation of the risk-significance of U.S. commercial nuclear power reactor operational events.  Under this requirement, the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) of the NRC will systematically evaluate U.S. nuclear plant operating experience to identify and document the operating events that were most likely to lead to inadequate core cooling and severe core damage (precursors), if additional failures had occurred.  Using standardized models provided by the NRC, the contractor shall perform detailed risk analyses of events or conditions that have occurred during all phases of reactor operations.  The contractor shall also provide technical on-call support to NRC staff for in-house analysis of other operating events.   
It is anticipated that the contract will be a cost reimbursement type contract.  The period of performance of the resultant contract will be forty-one (41) months.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available about January 22, 2004, and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO LIMIT COMPETITION FOR CONTINUATION OF THE NIOSH AGRICULTURAL (Ag) CENTER INITIATIVE EVALUATION PROCESS.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Morgantown, WV has a requirement to provide support for one existing Ag Center to take leadership responsibility for ensuring contination of Ag Center initiative evaluation process, and for developing and implementing a model for evaluating the impact of the Ag Center program on the safety and health of agricultural workers and their families.  This requirement would span three (3) years.  The NIOSH Agricultural Centers were established as part of the CDC/NIOSH Agricultural Health and Safety Initiative in 1990.  The Centers were established to conduct research, education, and prevention projects to address the nation’s pressing agricultural health and safety problems.  This program brings external partners, from the Agricultural Centers and other stakeholders, together with NIOSH investigators in a collaborative effort to prevent occupational disease and injury among agricultural workers.  Nine Centers are distributed geographically across the US to be responsive to the agricultural health and safety issues unique to the different regions of the nation. The objectives of the Ag Center program are to: conduct research related to the prevention of occupational disease and injury of agricultural workers and their families; develop, implement and evaluate educational and outreach programs for promoting health and safety for agricultural workers and their families; develop, implement, and evaluate model programs for the prevention of illness and injury among agricultural workers and their families; and  develop linkages and communication with other  governmental and non-governmental bodies involved in agricultural health and safety with special emphasis on communications with other agricultural health and safety programs.   The work requested in this contract will require the full cooperation of all the Centers.  A full understanding and working knowledge of the historical and current work of the Ag Centers will be required for the successful completion of the tasks required of this contract.  It is considered to be in the best interest of the Government to limit competition to the nine  (9) Agricultural Centers already participating in the program.  Do not respond to this notice as it is being issued for informational purposes only.

<DESC>PEOSTRI has a requirement to procure individual marksmanship training systems for small arms (handguns, machine guns, rifles, etc.) to assist soldiers currently serving in hostile environments to sustain and refine their marksmanship skills and for those who are preparing to deploy overseas.  The individual system needs to be independent of any special facilities or ranges so the soldier can practice at any time, at any particular place, and in all weather conditions.  The system needs to be deployable, lightweight, easily transported and assembled, independent of electric power, and an alternative to expending ammunition.  The proven system needs to provide immediate feedback to the soldier on the level of skill executed in the practice session and demonstrate improvement in soldiers’ marksmanship.  This acquisition also includes new equipment training (NET), spares, system technical support, and a warranty.  The projected FY04 requirement is for 1000 systems.  Delivery must begin 30 days after contract award with a production rate of 300 systems per month.  The projected FY05 quantity is for 3617 systems.  Destination points will be in CONUS and OCONUS.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to negotiate with Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc (BHTI), 600 Hurst Blvd, Hurst TX 76053 on an other than full and open competition for non-recurring engineering and design related to anticipated cost reduction initiatives on future production lots of  the AH-1Z and UH-1Y.  It is anticipated that this will be a modification to the existing EMD (Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development) contract, N00019-96-C-0128.   This requirement will be procured in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2), in that BHTI is the only responsible source and no other type of equipment will satisfy Marine Corps requirements. Bell Textron is the designer, developer and sole producer of the aircraft and the only known source that possesses the data, technical skills and requisite knowledge of the design, fabrication, performance, operation, maintenance and support characteristics of the AH-1Z and UH-1Y to fulfill this need in a timely manner.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to increase the labor requirements for the work currently being done by SoBran, Inc. under contract N01-AO-12746 for the operation and management of the NIAID animal care facilities.  The NIAID is opening a new facility allowing NIAID to conduct biodefense research and emerging infectious disease research.  This facility is also an expansion of critical ongoing malaria vector research.  Many research projects, in whole or in part will be moving to this facility.  A single prime contractor is best suited to maintain the continuity of operations while minimizing contractor variability in interpretation of operating procedures and oversight throughout the NIAID DIR Research Facilities.  The NIAID DIR will operate a total of eight animal facilities that are all integrated and interacting with each other on the same research projects.  Minimizing variability is critical to the scientific validation and subsequent success of these research projects.  For these reasons, NIAID believes that no other offerors can fulfill the existing needs for the operation of this new facility.  Please refer any questions in writing to Terrie Nestor at tnestor@niaid.nih.gov prior to February 23, 2004.  See Numbered Note 22.

DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement USAID/South Africa’s (USAID/SA) new Integrated Education Program (IEP) which is targeted to improve access to quality education for South Africa’s historically disadvantaged population.  The IEP will be implemented in the four target provinces –Eastern Cape (EC), Northern Cape (NC), KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Limpopo (LP). The Mission has developed parameters for a new primary education-focused activity that integrates and creates synergies with ongoing training and higher education activities, the IEP. The new IEP will build on the lessons learned and best practices developed over the course of the program, namely, (i) use of a holistic approach to school development, especially governance which must involve communities; (ii) emphasis on leadership development at both school and district levels; and (iii) provision of support to clusters of schools, rather than individual schools. Under the anticipated contract, the contractor will be expected to contribute to the achievement of the following key objectives in order to assist USAID/South Africa to attain the result of “improved quality of primary education,” with a specific focus on improving the system’s capacity to deliver quality math and science programs. Those objectives are:  (i) enhanced capacity of teachers (targeted to the teaching of literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science; (ii) effective implementation of Curriculum 2005 (C2005), with a focus on literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science curriculum; and (iii) improved educational management and enhanced school governance. The stated objectives are consistent with the National Department of Education (NDoE) and those of other local and international development partners. USAID/South Africa anticipates awarding one performanced based contract for a three year period using full and open competition. The government estimate is $16.3m with an optional 4th year for an additional amount of $6.6m. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Government-wide point of entry (GPE). This pre-solicitation notice can be viewed and downloaded using http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The solicitation, once issued, can be downloaded from the GPE. You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing, in general, and particularly from overseas Missions. You must confirm in writing to the contact person noted above that you have received this solicitation document and you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from the Internet in its entirety. USAID bears not responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations are occasionally issued and will be posted on http://www.fedbizops.gov

<SOLNBR>DTFA01-01-C-00101
<RESPDATE>011504
<CONTACT>Don B. Terry, (202) 493-1408
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration intends to award a single source modification to contract DTFA01-01-C-00101 in accordance with FAA AMS 3.2.2.4.1.2 to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) to meet the current and future requirements of the Agency Data Telecommunications Network 2000 (ADTN2000) Program. This contract modification will increase the current contract ceiling by 3M for a total contract value of 12M with no change to the current period of performance.  It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to continue to acquire these services from this contractor on a single source basis for the following reasons: SAIC provides high quality, in-depth management, technical/engineering and security services to the FAA on the Agency Data Telecommunications Network 2000 (ADTN2000 and on other programs as requested.  SAIC personnel have supported the FAA on the ADTN2000 Program since its inception and have the most complete background, technical knowledge and experience working with the network and user community and in planning and implementing management and security systems.  No other company can offer this level of knowledge and expertise. ADTN2000 is the FAAs national and international data network serving approximately 1000 sites, over 3800 host server systems and an estimated 40,000 users.  This network, the services it provides, and all of the connected user systems, is highly complex and expansive.  Due to greatly increased network traffic volume, the unforeseen impact on ADTN2000 from user system viruses and worms and the need for more systematic management of network resources and additional security capabilities, SAICs deep technical knowledge of ADTN2000 and experience is critically required.  The FAA has a requirement to develop network intrusion quarantine capabilities using ADTN2000 as a test case.  SAICs network security expertise and knowledge of ADTN2000 is key to the success of this effort.   SAICs experience in program management support for ADTN2000 and specialized knowledge of the user communities will be pivotal during the next 2-3 years for successful transition to the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) program replacement for ADTN2000.  The current ADTN2000 contract will expire in late 2004 necessitating a highly aggressive transition schedule.  Without SAICs detailed knowledge of this very large and diverse network, the FAAs ability to accurately identify requirements, issue required orders and conduct an efficient cutover would be severely impacted.  The inevitable schedule delays would necessitate extending the period of operating dual networks thereby significantly increasing FAA costs.   Therefore, the FAA intends to solicit, negotiate and award a single source contract modification to an existing contract with SAIC for support of the ADTN2000 Program and the follow-on services.   Inquires relative to this Pubic Announcement are to be submitted in writing by 15 January 2004. They should be addresses to the Federal Aviation Administration, Attention Don B. Terry, ASU-330, 800 Independence Avenue, S.W. Washington D.C. 20591.  Facsimile number is (202) 493-5927. The FAA is not liable for costs associated with the preparation or submittal of responses to this procurement.

<DESC>This modification to the original combined synopsis / solicitation provides answers to questions presented by prospective offerors regarding the requirements of this Request For Proposals (RFP), and makes administrative corrections to the earlier document.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS -- 

Q: Has there been a previous contract, if so can you provide details of the winning bid?

A: There is no previous contract for these services.

Q: What format is the data in?

A: The file format is a SAS dataset.

Q: What medium will be data be supplied on?

A: The data is stored on a Sun Microsystems server. The Government will consider handling data transfer in several ways, including (but not limited to) copying the data onto DVDs or downloading the data to the OPM mainframe and then copying it to mainframe cartridge tape.

Q: Who is the original database manufacturer (Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft, etc)?  

A: As stated earlier, the file format for all files is a SAS dataset.

Q:Will there be multiple databases? For example different data stored at BCBSA, Medco and Advance PCS?

A: All data is stored on a Sun Microsystems server in our office in Washington DC.

Q: How long is the record length?

A: The record length is 568 bytes.

Q: The RFP states that Medco/AdvancePCS were paid approximately $36 billion in 2002. Is the $36 billion number correct?

A: The RFP that was posted previously incorrectly states that the two PBMs were paid $36 billion by OPM in 2002.  $36 billion is incorrect.  The correct amount paid is $3 billion.  This distinct from the fact that OPM has paid carriers participating in the FEHBP approximately $6 billion for prescription drugs in 2002, but the $6 billion includes drug costs for ALL carriers, not just BCBS.

Q: Do you currently have pharmacy claims data from both Medco and AdvancePCS? If so, what format is the data and what media (CD or tape)?  If no, then will OPM assist in requesting data from the PBMs?

A: Yes.  The file format is a SAS dataset and is stored on a Sun Microsystems server in our office in Washington DC.

Q: Will the Blue Cross and Blue Shield PBM agreement regarding rebates from manufacturers be made available to vendors? Do the agreements have any audit clauses in them? Will there be restrictions on OIG and its vendors for retrospective audits? Will audit rights be transferred to OIG and its vendors?

A: The provider agreements between the BlueCross BlueShield Association (BCBSA) and the two PBMs have been provided to the OIG.  The OIG has also requested the contracts between the PBMs and the drug manufacturers.  All data needed to perform the objectives outlined in the RFP will be provided to the vendor.  The vendor will be required to sign a confidentiality agreement.  The contract between OPM and BCBSA includes an audit clause which permits OPM to audit certain costs associated with the PBM/BCBSA provider agreements.  The RFP's objectives outline the costs OIG will be reviewing.  There are no restrictions regarding retrospective audits.    

Q: Will OIG provide onsite office space (conference room) for audit training and vendor staff?  

A: Yes.

Q: How many auditors will attend the training program and will it be limited to one site? 

A: Six to ten auditors will require training.  The training will take place in our Washington DC office.
 
Q: Does OIG require our auditors to accompany and assist OIG audit staff during onsite visits to Medco and AdvancePCS?  If so, when are the anticipated onsite audit dates?

A: We will determine if onsite training if necessary after we receive training in our DC office.  We anticipate the onsite dates to be some time during the summer of this year.

Q: The RFP states that analysis should match drug therapy with medical diagnosis. In our experience the pharmacy claims data does not contain diagnosis codes, so medical claims data would have to be cross referenced in order to accomplish this goal. Is this necessary for the project? If it requires access to medical claims data will OIG provide the required data?

A: Yes.  OIG will provide the medical claims data needed to complete the review.  This type of review will not be performed on all of the drug claims.  We will sample some of the high dollar and/or high utilized drugs to review.

Q: The RFP states the vendor will begin work within 30 calendar days and complete the project within 90 calendar days. Considering it may take the PBMs time to send the claims data, can the completion date be contingent on receiving required data and documentation to complete the project?

A: The OIG will provide the vendor with all of the required data needed to complete the project. 

Q: Is it possible to get a database schema (such as Names of Tables, Fields, Field Sizes, and Relationships between Tables) of what is stored and would be available for the data analysis?

A: The data is not in a relational database format.  There are three files for retail pharmacy data from Advance PCS (one for each year being reviewed).  Each of these files contains about 50 million claim records.  There is a single file for the mail order drug data from Medco that contains about 25 million claim records.  All of the files are flat files.  Each file contains 109 fields.  We can provide a "field dictionary" that describes each of the fields in the files if necessary.

Q: The solicitation states that the contractor will need to provide OIG remote access to claim data/analysis.  We assume this means that OIG will need an account on our systems, or is providing OIG access to our pre-generated reports/spreadsheets (results) electronically adequate?

A: The OIG must have access to the system.  Pre-generated reports are not adequate.

Q: Can you please send me SF 1449 information and any other forms that we need to complete.

A: Government standard forms are available from various U.S. Government websites on the Internet.  For example, the SF 1449 is one of many procurement that can be downloaded from the U. S. general Services Administration website address at http://contacts.gsa.gov/webforms.nsf/93185254719078c6852569ae006af804?OpenView&Start=2.44.

ADMINISTRATIVE CORRECTIONS -- 

In the BACKGROUND section of the original, change the sentence about payments made to the two PBMs in FY 2002 to read, 

"For contract year 2002, these two PBMs were paid approximately $3 billion for benefits to BlueCross BlueShield subscribers in the FEHBP."

In the reference to the NOTICE OF TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE, the correct Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) reference is "FAR 52.219-6". The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement remains 524298, All Other Insurance Related Activities, with a small business size standard of $6 million.

<DESC>The previous FedBizOpps notice dated December 2, 2003 and the amendment dated December 10, 2003 is hereby changed.  The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC has a  requirement for a multi-year contract for the production of M231 PA161 and M232 PA103A2 Containers. This procurement is 100% small business set-aside.  The PA161/PA103A2 containers are the shipping and storage containers used  for the Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS).  The MACS Propelling Charge, designed and developed at Picatinny Arsenal, provides a complete zoning  solution for 155mm Artillery applications by using multiples of a basic  increment.  The containers were developed to protect the MACS Charges  throughout the Army’s stringent logistic environments and have design features that improve the insensitive munitions characteristics for the  MACS system.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards from the RFP.  A critical component of the PA161/PA103A2 is steel and the current lead-time is 90-120 days.  The successful offeror must be ISO 9000 certified by the start of production. Request all information be submitted via electronic media to mrhines@pica.army.mil.  Margaret Rhinesmith,  (973) 724-3050.  Large files need to be compressed using WinZip  http://www.winzip.com.  The MACS and its components are on the Militarily  Critical Technologies List (MCTL) Aug 1966.  Therefore, the MACS TDP is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C. SEC 2751) and is subject to DoD Directives 5230.24 and 5230.25. See Numbered Notes 1, 8, and 25.

<ARCHDATE>03132004
<CONTACT>xinia llovetzurinaga, 508 233 4146
<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is hereby amended to incorporate Questions and Answers submitted. QUESTIONS (Q) AND ANSWERS (A) FOR THE COMBAT GLOVES SOLICITATION Q. 1 My company is interested in designing or making a style of combat glove for the solicitation. Has a price range been set for the glove? The reason I ask is that clearly the glove will require a mix of Nomex/Kevlar and military spec leather. These two factors will make it a relatively expensive glove. A. For competitive reasons the Government cannot give out that information.   Q. 2 Does the glove need to be windproof and  / or waterproof? Do we submit a sample or multiple samples on January 13th? Or do you review the documentation and then request samples? A. Please read very carefully the combined synopsis/solicitation. It clearly reflects all the requirements for this solicitation.  It also gives instructions as to what offerors shall submit.  (proposals and a sample shall be submitted on due date).  Q.3 What I am interested in is if you have a bidders list available yet.  A.  Sorry but we don't have a bidder's list. Q. 4 Please provide me with the amendments to the combined synopsis/solicitation W911QY-04-R-XLZ0 for Combat Gloves. I have Modification 01 which extends the due date for proposals to 13 Jan 2003.  A. You have the only amendment to the solicitation there is, which includes the extension for the proposals due date for the Combat Gloves to 13 January 2004 NLT 3:30pm EST. Q. 5What agency is this listed under? Can't locate NATICK in DLA umbrella. A.   It is under Department of the Army. Q.6Would it be possible to extend the deadline for this solicitation to noon on January 13th ? A. Subject combined synopsis/solicitation has been amended to extend the proposal due date to 13 Jan/04.  Please go to the fedbizopps web page for details. Thank you. Q. 7 1) Why is a heavy weight fabric specified when a lighter fabric more than meets the cut and burn requirement as specified? 2) Is a heavy weight fabric specified because there are TPP or RPP thermal performance requirements implied or desired? (see NFPA 1951:2001 sec. 7.3.10) 3) The flame test that is specified does not speak to drip, are non-melting materials required? 4) No specific wear or abrasion requirement is set to validate the 120 day wear standard, would abrasion per 1951.2000, sec 7.3.3 be an appropriate way to set an unambiguous abrasion performance requirement? 5) Aramid or Kevlar thread is a very poor performer with regard to abrasion. We feel as in question 4 an abrasion test over the seams may be helpful in defining a thread requirement. A  1.  Government experience has shown that lighter weight fabrics when exposed to field use have not provided the durability needed for the soldier. 2.  The Government does not have a TPP or RPP thermal performance requirement as stated in the solicitation.  See answer to question number one above. 3. Yes.  Non-melting materials are required. 4.  The Government will accept industry standards for a minimum service life of 120 days. 5.  Although the Offeror has an excellent suggestion in defining a thread requirement, we cannot afford to delay this solicitation.  The Kevlar requirement remains unchanged. Q. 8 On page 2 it states that Kevlar thread must be used for flame resistance and durability. Does this mean that the whole glove must be woven with Kevlar thread? Because that is how we interpret it. Please clarify. A.  The combined synopsis/solicitation is very clear that the Combat Glove may be made from a combination of leather and textile materials or all leather (top of page 2) as long as it meets the Government requirements.  It is up to the Offeror to select th e material to use to make the gloves.  The Kevlar thread is cited for the purpose of sewing the glove together. Q. 9 Is it acceptable to submit variable pricing based upon quantities ordered by Govt? A.  Yes, it is acceptable. Q.10 Please consider extending the submittal period an additional 30 days on above solicitation. There is quite a bit of R & D involved and to receive a Combat glove, as described, will probably take additional time. Contributing to the short time frame are the  Christmas and New Year's holidays and vacations for personnel internal and external to our company. Certainly there is not enough time for independent lab testing, as required. Any new material to be considered can not be tested and incorporated into a gl ove in this limited time period. Also, please consider more than two styles allowed to be submitted. There is a lack of direction on length, under/over sleeve requirements, protection at key stress points (palm, back knuckles, trigger finger...) One must m ake an educated guess towards these requirements. With potential  production of 10,000 pairs/month it is important to create the correct product desired. A.  Due to the urgent need to provide the troops that are being deployed with Combat Gloves, we cannot extend the time or number of submissions.  Our experience has shown that 30 days for a commercial item and 2 submissions to be fair and reasonable.   The Government is not expecting industry to develop a new glove.  The intent is to purchase commercial-off-the-shelf gloves that can meet our requirements.  Therefore, the Government declines your request. Q. 11 Is there a static decay requirement for the glove?  (There is no such requirement in the solicitation.) A.  NO, there is no static decay requirement for this solicitation. Q. 12 Where Can I Find Previous Award History? A. There is no past history for this procurement.

The purpose of the Government/Industry Day is to discuss technical information on the manufacture  of this item and to allow potential bidders the opportunity to tour the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s facility, in particular the melt/pour and cooling processes, which are critical to successful manufacture of the burster.   The M54A1 Burster extends through the cen ter of a M110A2 Projectile that is a steel shell filled with approximately 15.6 pounds of white phosphorous (WP). The M54A1 Burster is composed of a burster tube 20.64 inches in length which is made from carbon steel and is filled with Composition B5 explo sive by adding sufficient TNT to molten Cyclotol Type I (75/25) to bring TNT composition to 34%. The Elastomer and Glyceride of 12-Hydroxy Steric Acid are then added separately and the mixture stirred until uniform. Process must result in a M54A1 Burster t hat meets radiographic requirements and chemical analysis requirement for TNT, RDX, and Resin. The function of the M54A1 Burster is as follows: Once the M110A2 Projectile is fired out of the gun tube the installed fuze functions on impact whereby it detona tes the M54A1 Burster which ruptures the burster case, projectile case and disperses the White Phosphorous (WP) filler. The White Phosphorous ignites spontaneously upon contact with air and produces a dense smoke, which is used for screening purposes.  Thi s market survey is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Potential offerors are advised that this requirement contains technical data as defined by 22 CFR Secti on 120.10.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Request for Expressions of Interest - Participation in the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center’s Education and Training Partnership with the State of Oklahoma’s Colleges, Universities and Trade Schools
<DESC>1)  This is a request for companies interested in working with the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) and State of Oklahoma educational institutions to graduate/produce workers prepared to fill a variety of blue collar and white collar positions at OC-ALC in the future.  OC-ALC and Oklahoma educational institutions established an Education and Training Partnership a few years ago to do just that.  This joint endeavor has been very successful to date.  This partnership is very important in light of an aging existing OC-ALC workforce and a smaller pool of workers in younger generations.  At the same time, OC-ALC is embarking upon several transformation initiatives to improve efficiency and effectiveness and ultimately improve support to our operational forces.     2)  OC-ALC’s success in the future will depend upon its ability to recruit and hire a highly capable organic workforce while at the same time expanding its partnerships with industry.  As we expand these partnerships with industry, our industry partners will also have a need for new workers.  To avoid competing for the limited number of current graduates, OC-ALC is interested in working with industry and state educational institutions to increase its current capacity for producing skilled workers.  OC-ALC envisions interested companies collaborating with their industry colleagues to jointly determine their future workforce needs in support of Tinker Air Force Base by entering into an agreement for that increased capacity with state educational institutions.  OC-ALC also envisions establishing an Associate Contractor-like Agreement with its industry partners to outline the rules of engagement.  OC-ALC will not be a party to or responsible for any industry commitment or agreement for hiring workers produced by state educational institutions.     3)  However, OC-ALC does expect to cooperate with its industry partners in this endeavor.  Those companies interested in discussing the potential for working with OC-ALC and Oklahoma educational institutions for future education and training needs are requested to submit written or electronic expressions of interest to the Contracting Officer listed below not later than 31 January 2004.

Selden, Contract Specialist (301) 415-7907, e-mail mcs1@nrc.gov AND Donald King, Contracting Officer, (301) 415-6731, e-mail dak1@nrc.gov.  ALL OFFERS SHALL BE FAXED to (301) 415-8157 NO LATER THAN 12:00 noon, NRC local time on 01/22/04.  All proposals shall be addressed to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Division of Contracts, Attn. Mona C. Selden, RFP No. NRR-04-027, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.  Solicitation No. NRR-04-027 herein is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This RFP is for full and open competition and the North American Industry Classification System Code is 325412 and the small business size standard is 750 employees.  The NRC intends to issue a Commercial Item, Fixed Price, Requirements Type Contract with a base period of performance of two years.  The contract will also contain three, one-year option periods. 

BACKGROUND-----In April 2001, the NRC revised 10 CFR 50.47b(10) of its emergency preparedness regulations. The revised rule requires that States with population within the 10-mile emergency planning zone of commercial nuclear power plants consider including potassium iodide (KI) as a protective measure for the general public to supplement sheltering and evacuation in the unlikely event of a severe nuclear power plant accident. Concomitant with this action the NRC offered to provide a supply of KI to each State or Tribe that incorporated KI for the general public into their emergency plans.  If local governments were designated by the State, NRC also provided a supply to the local governments.  Initially, NRC was only able to provide each State or Tribe with their initial supply of KI in 130 mg tablets.  However, because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the manufacture of 65 mg tablets, the NRC will continue to provide each State or Tribe with their initial supply of KI in 130 mg tablets, 65 mg tablets, or a combination of both. The NRC will also consider requests for 65 mg tablets from those States or Tribes who were previously supplied with 130 mg tablets.

OBJECTIVE-----The Contractor shall provide approximately 4.5 million 65 mg  KI tablets and approximately 950,000 130 mg KI tablets, produced by a FDA-approved manufacturer, in the quantities, and to the locations designated by the NRC Project Officer (PO) for the two-year base period of performance.  If exercised, the Contractor shall provide 300,000 65 mg and 300,000 130 mg of KI tablets for each of the three option periods.  

SCOPE OF WORK-----The Contractor shall Supply and Distribute Potassium Iodide (KI) Tablets as ordered by the NRC.										
CONFIGURATION OF POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS-----Each KI tablet, whether 65mg or 130mg, shall be manufactured by a FDA-approved manufacturer.  Each tablet shall be scored-in to enable the user to break the tablet into at least two pieces.  Each 130mg tablet shall have, at a minimum, a five-year shelf life, and each 65-mg tablet shall have, at a minimum, a three-year shelf life, from date of acceptance by the NRC or the NRC's authorized representative.  

TASK 1 - SUPPLY POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS-----During the two-year base period of performance, the Contractor shall provide approximately 4.5 million 65 mg KI tablets and approximately 950,000 130 mg KI tablets. If exercised, the Contractor shall provide 300,000 65 mg and 300,000 130 mg of KI tablets for each of the three option periods.  

TASK 2 - DISTRIBUTION-----The Contractor shall ship the specified number of KI tablets, to the locations identified in the delivery order, no later than 45 calendar days from receipt of the delivery order from the NRC PO (See Attachment 2 for Locations).  The Contractor shall maintain records of the shipping logs, showing quantities sent, receiving organization and proof of delivery.  A copy of these documents shall be provided to the NRC PO no later than five (5) calendar days from the date of delivery.  KI tablets shall be provided in a manner which provides for ease of distribution, storage, and maintains the shelf-life integrity of the tablets once provided to the States.   

DELIVERY SCHEDULE-----The Contractor shall ship the specified number of KI tablets to the location(s) identified in the delivery order no later than 45 calendar days from receipt of the delivery order from the NRC PO.

SUBMITTAL AND CONFIRMATION OF DELIVERY ORDER-----The NRC PO will e-mail the request for the tablets to the Contractor and follow-up the e-mail request with a telephone call.  The Contractor shall provide an e-mail confirmation to the NRC PO. 

BILL-TO AND SHIP-TO ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS-----The Contractor shall ship the tablets to various locations specified by the NRC PO, (See Attachment 2) while maintaining one overall Bill-to Account.  

POINT OF CONTACT-----The Contractor shall designate one primary and one alternate personnel as the point of contact.

TYPE OF CONTRACT AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE-----This is a firm fixed price/requirements type contract with a two-year base period of performance. This contract will also contain three one-year option periods.

Offerors are notified that all information provided in their proposals must be accurate, truthful, and complete to the best of the offeror's knowledge and belief.  The Commission will rely upon all such representations made by the offeror both in the evaluation process and for the performance of the work by the offeror selected for award.

UNIFORM ALLOWANCE  If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of wash and wear materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

This publication may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, at 202-783-3238, or by writin g to the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.  Copies of specific job descriptions may also be obtained from the appropriate contracting officer. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation) and computes a proposed rate). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
