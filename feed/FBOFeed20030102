<DESC>NAICS Code: 5418   	REQUEST FOR QUOTES/STATEMENT OF WORK Marketing Design and Consulting for the  Environmental Tobacco Smoke Team BACKGROUND The ETS (Environmental Tobacco Smoke) program mission is to eliminate the number of households where children six years of age and under are  exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, commonly known as secondhand smoke.   The ETS's team mission is to ensure that the percentage of American households where young children are exposed to secondhand smoke at home is reduced from 29% in 1994 to 15% in 2005.  Some of the primary methods by  which we plan to achieve this goal are: ?	Communication tools that are capable of effectively reaching and empowering parents to make their homes smoke free. ?	Ensure that our efforts reach low-income and disadvantage at risk populations ?	Develop and implement ETS messages upon which prevention  and intervention programming can be based.     ?	Continue with our successful ETS media campaign, integrating our Pledge Campaign message and pursuing specific advertising channels to better reach our target audience. ?	Leverage existing activities to get action on ETS, especially promoting  smoke-free home pledges to families with children with asthma.  ?	Continue to pursue a vigorous advertising and public communications program promoting the smoke-free homes pledge hotline and other EPA ETS educational products. ?	Use the web and other innovative tools to communicate our message,  distribute our products and showcase risk-reduction ideas. ?	Link ETS education outreach messages with the adverse health impact as a trigger in children with asthma. PURPOSE Under this Purchase Order, the Contractor will develop a new smoke-free home pledge kit (mailing piece) and brochure is  for the Environmental Tobacco Smoke Team to bring together the issue of promoting parents and caregivers to keep a smoke-free home and the direct impact it has on children's health. The products should be perceived by the audience as reward and/or recognition for making the pledge and provide  encouragement to keep a smoke-free home  REQUIREMENTS Due to a short project timeline and limited budget, the ideal Contractor would be located in the Washington, D.C. area to allow for quick and easy travel to both the Contractor's and EPA's offices. This would also be beneficial for frequent  meetings and fast-turn around product review and development. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE The period of performance of this Purchase Order will be from the effective date through January 31, 2004 STATEMENT OF WORK The Contractor shall strategically develop a new smoke-free home pledge brochure and  kit, the cornerstone product in the ETS program, to increase public awareness, specifically parents and caregivers of environmental tobacco smoke and the health benefits of keeping a smoke-free home. The Contractor shall establish measurable marketing objectives, determine market trends and  conditions, identify appropriate strategies and recommend tactics to meet those objectives. The Contractor may be required to determine market trends and perform analysis.  The smoke-free home pledge brochure is expected to deliver straight-forward health risk information and call-to-action both by  the pledge hotline and pledge website. The smoke-free home pledge kit is expected to include several components such as a brochure, certificate, letter from the EPA Administrator and a home-related freemium (magnet, ruler or others). The brochure and kit must created to suit the culture of diverse  populations including English-speaking and Spanish-speaking audiences. The Contractor shall provide exclusive- and unlimited-use commercial art (custom or stock), graphic design, and special effects that educate the consumer market about environmental tobacco smoke and the health benefits of  keeping a smoke-free home. The Contractor may also be required to update, rewrite and/or edit current materials and products. Types of services may include developing copy, translations, conceptual design and layouts (for print and web), sketches, drawings, publication designs, typographic layouts,  and artwork including electronic artwork. Once the final graphics and text are completed for the print products, the same graphics and text will need to be prepared for posting on EPA's website. The Contractor will provide possible web layout concepts and the related files but will not perform any  work on EPA's website. All deliverables must be EPA computer compliant including using only PC software such as WordPerfect 9, Pagemaker 6.5 and Photoshop 6.0.  All the files must be prepared for high-quality printing and web publishing. Criteria for Marketing Design and Consulting The  products should be designed as direct mail package that would be welcoming to parents and caregivers. The products must be professionally designed to have a cohesive look and feel and very effectively assist a family in keeping its commitment to maintain a smoke-free home. Copyrighting for an  eighth grade reading level is required to convey health messages. In addition, the smoke-free home pledge package should have a creative "give-away" piece as a thank-you token to parents and as a pass-along vehicle to spread the smoke-free home message. The overall design and delivery of the  smoke-free home products must be developed based on already proven and practiced consumer research, marketing strategies and healthcare messaging. Graphics and Text ?	Graphics include providing  the EPA IED Project Manager with professional proposal boards of three concepts for pre-approval and  providing draft layouts of graphics and/or photography and text for approval prior to final execution. ?	The Contractor shall trans-create and translate text and graphics to suit the culture of diverse populations, especially Spanish-speaking audiences. ?	The Contractor shall create original  artistic renderings, photography sessions, graphic design, copy, layout, and production of high-resolution graphics in full color (or black & white). The files must be appropriate for professional printing and for the internet. ?	The Contractor will work with the EPA IED Project Manager to develop  text for the products.  Vendor will critique and refine text for consumer and educational appeal. DELIVERABLES Timeline for Brochure and Kit The current stock of smoke-free home pledge products are dwindling quickly and therefore the  Contractor shall deliver a replacement product by April 1,  2003.  ?	Conceptual design, based upon discussions and meeting(s )with IED Project Officer, will be provided within 15 working days after award of purchase order.  ?	Initial conceptual design will be refined, in coordination with the IED Project Officer and the first full draft will be provided in  10 working days. ?	The draft design will be refined, in coordination with the IED Project Officer and will be provided within three working days. ?	Once the final draft is approved, the Contractor shall provide three hard copies and three  CD-ROM copies of the printer files, web files and completed  Government Printing Form 952 within five working days. QUOTE SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS Offerors shall prepare a succinct written technical proposal which demonstrates their understanding of the Statement of Work.  The technical proposal shall provide documentation that supports the offeror's  ability to perform this requirement,  provides resumes of the personnel proposed for assignment to the project and provides three (3) references that can be contacted to support past performance of similar work.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  In using radiation for medical treatment, it is critical that the amount and location of the radiation delivery be controlled as closely as possible.  An error in radiation intensity can result in excessive tissue damage, or the radiation not accomplishing its intended purpose.  An error in location can inadvertently cause damage to healthy tissue and organs and sometimes to critical organs such as the eyes or brain.  The technology developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory allows a precise location and amount of radiation to be read in real time.  This real-time information alerts the treatment provider to errors in radiation dosage and location.   The technology involves a probe that is placed near the area to be treated.  The probe, which can be made quite small and inserted in the body, consists of a scintillation detector constructed of doped scintillation fiber optic material that creates a light signal for the particular type of radiation to be used in treatment.   For example, one probe can be used for high energy neutrons, and another for x-rays and gamma ray photons, and yet a third for thermal and epithermal neutrons.  The light signals from the probes travel down the fiber optic path and are interpreted through standard equipment such as photo-multiplier tubes, solid-state detection devices, and multi-channel analyzers to provide the real time feedback.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 60 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>S--PRIVATIZATION OF GOVERNMENT OWNED FACILITIES AT U.S. ARMY, DUGWAY PROVING GROUND, UTAH
<SOLNBR>DABJ19-03-R-0004
<RESPDATE>040103
<ARCHDATE>05312003
<CONTACT>ERIC VOKT, 435-831-2107
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Contracting Agency, Dugway Proving Ground is soliciting for the privatization of utility systems (electric, water and wastewater) at U.S. Army, Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibil ity for operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades and future utility system replacements. The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under 10 USC 2688. It imposes certain economic tests that must be met prior to aw ard of a contract(s). The resulting contract(s), if awarded, will require the Contractor(s) to furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental services for the complete  ownership, operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades and improvements to these utility systems. The Contractor(s) will be required to manage, control and perform its operations, maintenance, repairs, replacements and incidentals of its utility system(s) to  provide firm, reliable and dependable utility service to each Government or tenant connection within the service area 24 hours each and every day. The utility systems will be conveyed by way of a Bill of Sale upon award of contract(s) and real property in terests will be conveyed in the form of Easements. The Contractor(s) proposal and plans may become a part of the contract upon decision to award. The Government anticipates awarding a Fixed-Price with Prospective Price Redetermination Utility Services Cont ract(s) for a term of 50 years to the Best Value offeror(s). The ability to award individual systems to individual firms will exist. This requirement is unrestricted. The solicitation is DABJ19-03-R-0004. ELECTRICAL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: Dugway Proving Groun d currently purchases wholesale electric power at 46-kV from Utah Power & Light Company (UP&L) at a single primary delivery point near the English Village area. The DPG electric distribution system is currently Army owned and consists of: (1) Three 46-kV d istribution substations, (2) Approximately 10 circuit-miles of 46-kV transmission line, (3) Approximately 73 circuit-miles of 12.5-kV overhead primary distribution line, and (4) Approximately 9 circuit-miles of 12.5-kV underground primary distribution line . The distribution system is composed primarily of overhead, pole-line construction (wood pole, open wire) with pole-mounted transformer banks. There is a relatively small amount of underground primary. Cu rrent peak loads approximate 3.5 megawatts with a fairly consistent year-round and around the clock loading. The system appears to be in quite good condition and individual meters are currently located within most of the housing area. POTABLE WATER SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The water treatment and distribution system comprises mains, service lateral lines, main valves, fire and yard hydrants, back flow preventors, and steel elevated and ground storage tanks. The distribution system is primarily cast iron piping. The water system consists of three independent sub systems. The first system serves English Village; the second system serves Ditto Technical Center, Avery Technical Center, Baker Lab Area, and Michael Army Airfield; the third system is for the Carr Complex. Operation and maintenance has been provided for several years by a base O&M contract. Two separate non-potable water systems provide irrigation water for English Village area: one for the golf course south of Stark Road, the other for the main containment area north of Stark Road. WASTEWATER SYSTEM DESC RIPTION: The wastewater collection and treatment systems at DPG consist of four independent systems. The first serves English Village; the second serves Ditto, Avery, and Michael Army Airfield; the third serves Baker Lab; and the four th serves the Carr co mplex. In all areas, the collection systems are a combination of gravity and force mains with lift or pumping stations. Sizes of the collection mains range from  6 to 15 inches. Generally, all systems were installed between 1942 and the early 1950's, though some upgrades have been completed. There are approximately 82,000 lineal feet of wastewater collection mains and 196 manholes within the English Village/Fries Park Complex. The most common pipe size is 8 inches, comprising nearly half of the collection system. DPG completed a new headworks and lagoon system in 1996 to service the English Village and Fries Park area. The headworks consists of a weir, a 3 HP commi nutor rated at 1 MGD, flow-measurement sensor, manual bar screen, and a 6-inch Partial flume. Three lagoon cells, each with a rating a 5 million gallons, have a minimum detention of 12.5 days. Maximum sludge deposition is one foot, and water depth is six f eet with a freeboard of three feet. Each cell is equipped with floating mechanical aerators. Cell 1 and 4 aerators (2 @ 20 HP and 2 @ 15 HP) . Cell 2 has 4 aerators @ 5 HP each. Cell 3 has 2 aerators @ 5 HP each. The chlorine scrubber, cathodic test port, and propane tank for the emergency generator are all located near the control building. The concrete chlorine contact basin is approximately 23-feet wide by 36-feet long and 10-feet deep. Final effluent from the chlorine contact basin is discharged into a drainage culvert running parallel to a main access dirt road. It then crosses the road and flows into an open, evaporative holding area. A backup treatment process is also available in the form of an ultra-violet (UV) treatment facility. This sy stem is bu ilt in parallel and enables treatment of the waste stream as it bypasses the chlorine contact basin. Ditto and Every Technical Centers/Michael Army Airfield. The Ditto wastewater collection and treatment system also serves the Avery Technical Cen ter area and Michael Army Airfield. In outlying areas, some buildings are serviced by a septic tank and drain field system (not included in the study). The maps show a new 8 vitrified clay main lane as well as four new manholes serving the Avery Facility . (Date of  the upgrade was not discernable from available data.) The old system was abandoned in place. The collection system incorporates a series of primarily 6- and 8-inch gravity lines flowing into a 10-inch vitrified clay main, which, in turns, flows to the lag oons. The system has approximately 16, 500 feet of wastewater collection mains and 64 manholes. A sewage lift station pumps effluent from Avery and Michael Army Airfield into the Ditto collection system via a 4-inch force main. A final lift station at the end of the main collection line pumps influent into the lagoon system. A new headworks and lagoon system was completed in 1992 to serve the Ditto wastewater systems. The new lagoon system is comprised of three cells with a holding capacity of one million g allons per cell. Lagoons have five floating mechanical aerators (2 in cells 1 and 2, and one in Cell 3). Effluent flows to an open, evaporative holding area. Carr Complex. The Carr Complex, located approximately four miles southeast of Ditto, is an indepen dent system. In the past, Carr was totally serviced by septic tank and drain field systems. In most instances, the septic tanks and drain fields were abandoned with new service lines into the collection system and new lagoon. Buildings that remain on septi c systems are not included in this privatization study. The system includes approximately 2,500 feet of 4- and 10- inch collection lines, 1 lift station, 10 manholes, and a sort length of 4-inch force main to the lagoon. A new, 2.28 million gallo n, single  cell lagoon was constructed in 1990. It has no mechanical aeration. An emergency overflow channel drains into an open, evaporative area. Baker Complex. Wastewater from all building in Baker Complex is collected by gravity flow into 6-inch cast ir on mains . The system has 24 manholes. The lift station is fed y two 6-inch influent pipes. The prefabricated concrete manhole is approximately ten feet deep and has two  staged, float-activated pumps; each rated at 1.0 HP and 80 GPM. The lift station is equipped with an overflow sensor and alarm. An 8-inch PVC for the main moves the influent to the lagoon. The 1.5 million gallon, single-cell lagoon is not aerated. All res ponsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered. To be eligible for award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). You may register via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov. Large businesses are required to s ubmit a subcontracting plan which meets the requirements of FAR 52.219-9.

<DESC>CLARIFICATION. This solicitation encompasses a Two-Phase Source Selection: Phase I/Request for Qualification requires the submission of Past Performance Information (reference requirements on listed website); this submittal information only is due on January 6, 2002.  Those prospective offerors determined "highly qualified" will proceed to Phase II, where they will receive the Request for Proposal.  The past performance information will be carried over from Phase I, and Phase II will evaluate Management Approach and Price/Cost.  At this point, no tentative dates have changes.  Concerning the Past Performance Information due January 6, each prospective offeror must provide the questionnaire (posted on our website) to those contractors whom you will reference in previous work.  These contractors must fill out the questionnaire and return to our office (PENREN) via fax.  Base on the initial ambiguity alluding that the Management Approach information was also due on January 6, if you already have this included in your package, it will not be evaluated in Phase I (only Past Performance will be evaluated), and you will have the opportunity to resubmit this information with your RFP package in Phase II. Once again, our website is  (http://renovation.pentagon.mil/)..........................
TENANT RELOCATION MOVE SERVICES - The Government is seeking multiple professional moving service contractors to provide logistical services in support of the Pentagon Renovation Program.  The program encompasses a complete internal renovation of the entire Pentagon facility including the logistical support and activities required to ready the space for the construction and the final tenant moves required when the renovation spaces become fully operational. As of September 15, 2002, there remain approximately 2.5 million square feet and 14,000 staff positions, which will be impacted by future renovation activities.  The goals of this contract are to provide relocation and move services in such a way that they: minimally impact the day to day operation of Pentagon activities and those of the tenants, are in compliance with the required task and activity schedule of the Pentagon Renovation Program 100% of the time and are executed in such a manner as to reflect only the Best Practices of the Industry. The selected contractors must exhibit extensive experience in providing the resources management, labor, transportation, materials, equipment, expertise and the performance excellence necessary to relocate the Department of Defense Staff as required by the Pentagon Renovation Program schedule.  Contractors shall be required to provide and manage all move related services on a task order basis. Each task order will be developed, proposed, and negotiated based on the rates established in the contract in support of a specific Statement of Work provided by the designated Government representative to the designated contractor. The number of moves will vary based on move group size, factors relating to construction, schedule and tenant requirements. Many of the moves will include office furniture, equipment, modular furniture, files, medical and clinical materials, sophisticated computer systems, filing systems and typical office contents. The contractor may expect moves to be scheduled to occur at any time of the day, night, including weekends and holidays.  This will be a two-phased source selection, with Phase I (obtaining past performance information, qualifications, and capacity to perform) down-selecting to all highly qualified contractors. The Request for Qualifications (RFQ), Past Performance Questionnaire and draft Statement of Work may be downloaded from the links below. The RFQ Submittals and Past Performance Questionnaire are due no later than 3:00pm on January 6, 2003, with selection of those qualified contractors who will proceed to Phase II, tentatively scheduled for completion on January 24, 2003.    To access the ?Request for Qualification?, ?Past Performance Questionnaire?, and the ?Draft Statement of Work?, enter the following URL: (http://renovation.pentagon.mil/businessops. htm?#comp).  Phase II/issuance of the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) is tentatively scheduled of January 27, 2003. We will evaluate past performance, technical sample taskings, management approach, and cost/price; resulting in award up to three best value, Performance Based Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Incentive (up to 8% Award Fee) contracts. Each contract will consist of a base year and four one-year options. The estimated value per contract is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance:  1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance and 3) Cost.  Technical Capability and Past Performance when combined are significantly more important than cost. 
Factor I.  Technical Capability ? Evaluation will be based on the extent to which the offeror clearly demonstrates the following:

1. The methodology used to recruit, evaluate and recommend qualified candidates.
2. A thorough knowledge of the structure of the Department of the Navy and how the Civilian Personnel Establishment  supports the war fighting capability of the Department of the Navy.
3. A thorough understanding of the Merit Principles, EEO laws and appointment in accordance with  5 USC 3393.

The following adjectives should be used as general guidance in assessing the technical capability:
"Outstanding"  Very significantly exceeds most or all solicitation requirements.  "Better"  Fully meets all solicitation requirements and significantly exceeds many of the solicitation requirements. 	"Acceptable"  Meets all solicitation requirements.  "Marginal"	Less than "Acceptable."  There are some deficiencies in the technical proposal. 	"Unacceptable"	Technical proposal has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions.

Factor II:  Past Performance:  The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on a maximum of three (3) previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, or email) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

The following adjectives should be used as general guidance in assessing Past Performance: ?Neutral?: No relevant past performance available for evaluation.	?Outstanding?: No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable) based upon offeror's past performance. ?Better?: Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product.  ?Satisfactory?: Some potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product. ?Marginal?: Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product.   A rating of marginal does not by itself make the proposal ineligible for award.

Addenda to FAR 52.212-1is DFARS 252.204-7004 entitled "Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at https://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil/ccr/scripts/index.html .

All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.

SPAWAR SYSTEMS CENTER, SAN DIEGO intends to negotiate a sole-source contract modification with Computer Science Corporation, San Diego, CA under their existing contract N66001-97-D-5007.
