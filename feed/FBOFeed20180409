This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

<DESC>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) - Contracting Office - Defense Healthcare Management Systems (CO-DHMS), in support of the Program Executive Office for Defense Healthcare Management Systems (PEO DHMS) Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) Program Office, intends to issue a sole source modification to contract N00039-15-D-0044 with Leidos, Inc. of Reston, VA, for all elements of the solution required to implement and maintain a standard solution baseline with the Department of Veterans Affairs and to incorporate the United States Coast Guard (USCG) into the resulting standardized baseline.  The contract action described below may be solicited and awarded without full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1).
<p>N00039-15-D-0044 was awarded on July 29, 2015 to Leidos, Inc. after a full and open competition.  The total award ceiling was $4,336,822,777 across a potential 10-year ordering period, if all optional ordering periods are exercised and award terms are earned.  The contractor will provide an off-the-shelf (OTS) electronic health record (EHR) system for deployment across the enterprise.  Leidos, the prime contractor, serves as the service provider-integrator (SPI) of the solution.  The DHMSM EHR consists of inpatient and outpatient solutions from Cerner and a dental solution provided by Henry Schein.  MHS GENESIS is replacing functionality of core legacy systems (AHLTA, CHCS, and Essentris, among others), and is being deployed to both fixed medical treatment facilities and operational medicine facilities all over the world.  The Leidos Partnership supports the integration, configuration, testing, deployment, training, operational management, and sustainment of MHS GENESIS.</p>
<p>On 14 OCT 2017, the DHA assumed all contracting responsibilities for the DHMSM contract from the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command.</p>
<p>On 01 JUL 2017, the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) issued a Determination and Findings (D&amp;F) pursuant to 41 U.S.C. &sect; 3304(a)(7) that it was in the public interest for VA to issue a solicitation directly to Cerner for the acquisition of the EHR system being deployed by the DHMSM PMO in order to enable seamless healthcare to Veterans and qualified beneficiaries.  The findings described in the D&amp;F delineated many reasons that a single standard solution baseline would benefit both Departments and the beneficiaries they support.</p>
<p>On 22 MAR 2018, the Deputy Commandant for Mission Support - United States Coast Guard, formally requested to partner with PEO DHMS to implement MHS GENESIS for the USCG.  USCG military members receive medical and dental care at DoD Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs), VA healthcare facilities, and from commercial providers under TRICARE contracts.  Further, the USCG provides medical and dental treatment and care to DoD beneficiaries at USCG clinics. The USCG's analysis indicated that all of its requirements would be satisfied by the MHS GENESIS solution and that it would achieve the same critical benefits of a single standard solution as DoD and VA; most notably to ensure that every military beneficiary and retiree has access to a single, unified  Electronic Health Record.</p>
<p>In addition to the existing MHS GENESIS capabilities, the VA contract will require the implementation of extended capabilities that were not available at the time of the original DHMSM contract or were not proposed against the Government's identified requirements.  While the original DHMSM contract included enterprise licensing terms that allowed for the incorporation of all existing and future capabilities within the contractor's commercial "Best of Suite", some of the extended capabilities necessary to maintain a single standard solution baseline with the VA and USCG are provided as clinical application services (CAS) not covered by the existing DHMSM license agreement.</p>
<p>Moreover, these CAS capabilities cannot be fully realized unless they are implemented in the Cerner environment.  In order to fully enable these functionalities, MHS GENESIS requires direct access to proprietary Cerner data, which is only available from Cerner.  Utilizing any other solution would prevent access to these capabilities and render it impossible to maintain a single standard baseline solution with the VA and USCG.</p>
<p>The scope being added under this modification will allow for the ordering of all services and additional capabilities necessary to maintain a standard solution baseline with the VA and USCG as they implement the solution.  The total ordering ceiling will be updated to accommodate the additional services and capabilities, but the period of performance of IDIQ contract N00039-15-D-0044 will remain unchanged. Because of the necessity of maintaining a single standard solution baseline, the Leidos Partnership for Defense Health is the only source for the required services.</p>
