<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Energy Information Administration (EIA), Office of Integrated Analysis and Forecasting (EI-80), intends to award a sole source contract to Wood Mackenzie Limited of Houston Texas for Pathfinder Subscription Services.  The period of performance for this license is April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009.  The requirement consists of licenses for the current version of the Pathfinder service, which compiles field level information on historical and projected hydrocarbon production, development history, financial indicators, and corporate holdings.  This database is a critical component of numerous reports required from EIA by law, for example the Annual Energy Outlook and the International Energy Outlook. While there are other sources for domestic oil field information, there is no single source for international field level data of this variety which is comparable to the Pathfinder service. This requirement is composed of a basic package of licenses and support which will form the initial award, with further optional items to be awarded subsequently based on funding availability.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation is available for this requirement. Interested parties may submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement within 15 calendar days of the publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
(JUN 2006)

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

<DESC>CROSS REFERENCE MARKET RESEARCH HSFLGL08R00006.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, THERE WILL BE NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE FOR DOWNLOAD FOR THIS ACTION.  FIRMS MUST RESPOND BY SUBMISSION OF COMPLETED STANDARD FORM 330, ARCHITECT ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M., 30 DAYS FROM DATE OF THIS NOTICE, AS OUTLINED HEREIN:  

Architectural-Engineering Services are required to provide Engineering, Planning, Design and Post Construction Award Services for Department of Homeland Security, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) projects.  Projects will be executed in the FLETC locations of Glynco, Georgia (adjacent to Brunswick, Georgia); Artesia, New Mexico; Cheltenham, Maryland; and Charleston, South Carolina.   The requirement will also encompass future Federal Law Enforcement Training Center locations, which may be established within the 50 United States.

Services shall be secured by issuing individual delivery orders against a minimum of three multiple-award, multi-discipline contracts at each of the FLETC locations: 1) Artesia, NM; 2) Cheltenham, MD; and 3) Glynco, GA/Charleston, SC (considered a single location for this acquisition).  Scopes of work require a multi-discipline approach including, but not limited to, architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, structural, civil, environmental, and other disciplines as required to conduct/execute field surveys, site and subsurface soil investigations, charrettes and concept/pre-design studies, program development, building and utility system investigations and evaluations, provide design/construction documents and construction cost estimates, post construction award review and management services, quality assurance, value engineering reviews, and other related services of the listed project types.

The FLETC provides the requisite support and service facilities to establish and maintain a state-of-the-art law enforcement training facility.  Such facilities may include, but are not limited to, indoor firing ranges, automobile driver training ranges, student dormitories, office buildings, classroom buildings, physical techniques training facilities, conference facilities (including auditorium and food service), parking structures, campus utility systems and roadway infrastructure, storm drainage structures, hazardous material storage facilities, and central utility plants.  Projects may include, but are not limited to, new construction and/or major renovation and modernization of:  (1) Classroom Buildings (All locations, ranging in size from 50,000 to 270,000 gross sq.ft.), (2) Driver Training Ranges and associated facilities (All locations), (3) Indoor Firearms Ranges (All locations), (4) Steam&/or Chilled Water Distribution System Improvements (Glynco), (5) Physical Techniques Facility (All locations), (6) Practical Exercise Facilities (All locations), (7) Dormitory/Student Housing (Glynco/Charleston & Artesia), (8) Utilities Upgrades to include  power, water, and/or sanitary sewer distribution systems (All locations), (9) Office Buildings (All locations)  (10) Roadway networks (All locations) and, (11) Cafeteria Renovation (All locations).  

It is anticipated that there will be a minimum of three basic contracts awarded for each of the three FLETC locations outlined herein, for a minimum of nine awards.  However, the Government reserves the right to award as many contracts as deemed appropriate per location based on the responses to this announcement.  The Government will utilize the procedures outlined in FAR Part 36, as supplemented, to competitively secure services of the most highly qualified firms, as determined by the A-E Evaluation board using the selection criteria outlined herein.    Initial selection and award will not be project specific.   Each contract will be a multi-discipline, indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity type contract.  After the basic contracts have been awarded, delivery orders will be placed on an intermittent, ?as required,? basis to the most highly qualified firm as determined by review of SF330s on file of the basic contract A-E firms, which will be updated, at a minimum, annually.   However, firms are not restricted from submitting revised SF330s as firm conditions change.

Should a subsequent delivery order require special services or disciplines that are not included in the basic award, the Government reserves the right to request each basic contract awarded A-E firm, within the applicable regional contract pool, to advise if the firm is interested in being considered for the specific project.  The request will be accompanied by a copy of the scope of services, an estimated construction cost, and evaluation and award factors for the specific project, if different from that used in the initial selection process.  Typically, the time frame for this response will be 7 to 14 calendar days. The firms will be required to submit a revised SF 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, Part I, if interested, and outline the disciplines required to accomplish the specific requirement.  Upon receipt of responses, the submissions will be reviewed and the firm deemed the most highly qualified firm as determined by the Government will be solicited for a price proposal for the project. 

As of this date, each basic contract will include a base contract period of one (1) year or $1,000,000.00 in fees, with the possibility of four (4) one-year option periods, or $1,000,000.00 in fees per option period, whichever occurs first.  The options will be exercised only if found to be in the Government?s best interest (subject to workload and/or satisfaction of A-E performance).   The total contract value for each contract will not exceed $5,000,000.00 for the contract life.  The minimum and maximum design service fee for each subsequent delivery order will range between $5,000.00 and $500,000.00.  There will be a guaranteed minimum of $10,000.00 for the life of each basic contract awarded.  Some relatively small projects, with quick turnaround times, should be anticipated by successful firms.

Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms may be required to work with a Construction Manager (at risk) (CMc) firm at the completion of the Schematic Design Phase stage.  A-E firms must agree to accept a relationship of trust and confidence and covenants with the Government to furnish the A-E?s reasonable skill and judgment and to cooperate with the Construction Manager Contractor in furthering the interests of the Government.  Use of CMc approach will be identified in each follow-on delivery order, if required.

The purpose of this procurement is to select firms highly qualified to provide these A-E services.  Due to the variety of projects anticipated, the selected firms must possess a wide range of professional services in-house for matters of expediency and quality with considerable experience in architecture and engineering for the law enforcement training facilities and the general types of facilities listed above.  Design teams will be required to demonstrate considerable experience in designing firing ranges, driver training ranges, gymnasiums, classroom buildings, dormitories, food service facilities, roadways and various utility distribution systems.  Experience must include an in-depth knowledge of related complex small arms ranges to include targetry and ballistic materials and classrooms with audiovisual systems.

As part of each contract, asbestos and lead assessments may be required to determine the presence of asbestos or lead.  When asbestos or lead is found, comprehensive asbestos or lead surveys, to include sampling and testing, and the preparation of plans and specifications showing the location of asbestos and lead, and specifying the procedure to be followed during construction and/or demolition for removal or abatement, will be required.  Shop drawing review, construction management and quality assurance, and review of contractor furnished operation and maintenance manuals shall be required.  A-E shall demonstrate the ability to perform studies and prepare environmental permit documentation for approval by various local, state, and national environmental agencies (i.e., USCOE, Georgia DNR).  For projects of new construction and requiring Environmental Assessments and or plans necessary to obtain permits from environmental regulatory agencies (i.e., USACOE, and State Environmental Departments), required studies, reports, and documentation necessary to achieve project results may also be required.  Firms unable to accept work that involves one or more of the efforts outlined herein, need not apply.

Firms are required to prepare cost estimates utilizing the computerized CES, specifications in the SPECSINTACT system format, and drawings in AutoCAD compatible format.

Firms shall have the ability to prepare bid/design/build contract packages.  

Facsimile (FAX) applications will not be accepted.  Any inquiries (including submission of SF330) should identify the title, location, and solicitation number on the outside of the envelope.  Architect-Engineer firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are required to submit one copy of a completed SF330 form.

Following an initial evaluation of the qualification data and performance data submitted by the firm, three or more firms considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required will be chosen for interview.  The Department of Homeland Security policy for selection of Architect-Engineer firms is not based upon competitive bidding procedures, but rather upon the professional services required.

This is a voluntary program, however the Government shall consider the extent to which an offeror demonstrates current, or recently initiated, enrollment and current, or planned participation in the E-Verify program, or any other successor program managed by DHS, during the evaluation of proposals.  Firms will not be evaluated on an absolute standard, but rather the Government shall attribute more significance to offeror participation for an entire workforce versus participation only for single, or multiple, discrete workforce segments.  Contractors not currently or planning participation will be given a neutral rating of this sub-factor in the evaluation of their response to this solicitation.  Firms may register for the E-Verify Program on-line at:  https://www.vis-dhs.com/employerregistration/. This site provides instructions for completing the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for official registration in the Program.

It is anticipated that the remaining fifty percent of the awards will be issued on an unrestricted basis.   The final composition will be based on the quality and number of responses received from the SDVOSB concerns.  However, should insufficient response be received from qualified SDVOSB Concerns, 100% of the action will proceed on an unrestricted basis.  However, the Government will reserve the right to set-aside one award to an 8(a) firm, dependant on results from synopsis for slate/select.

Firms are advised that as required by FAR 52.219-9, a large business successful offeror will be required to submit for approval, a subcontracting plan outlining which portions of the work subcontracted is to be awarded to Small Businesses; Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Historically Underutilized Zone Small Business (HUBZone), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), and Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB).  This plan is not required with the submission of the SF330, but an acceptable subcontracting plan must be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business.  However, firms must address small business subcontracting criteria in the SF330, Block 30.  Failure to submit and negotiate the subcontracting plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.  

The Department of Homeland Security has assigned goals expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses of 40.0%.  Included in the SB goals are targets for:  SDB (including Historically Black College/Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI)) - 5.0%; WOSB ? 5%; HUBZone - 3.0%; and SDVOSB -3.0%.

<DESC>The HVAC system in the basement functions poorly, is inefficient, and replacement parts are a piecemeal approach to adequate operations. The chiller is no longer a feasible option for service and must be replaced. The old chiller is to be removed and replaced with a new energy-efficient chiller, sized to handle cooling requirements for two buildings, with required new plumbing, and necessary digital controls. Plumbing, electrical, and structure must be considered in the replacement of the chiller. Bids will be considered for the 60-ton McQuary and the 60-ton Trane.

<SOLNBR>N4008308R0054
<CONTACT>Katie Kuehn 847-688-2600 x 103
<DESC>SYNOPSIS:  This solicitation is being issued on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  This is a two-step design/build construction project, Request for Proposals, Number N40083-08-R-0054. It is the intent and objective of the Government to obtain services including labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision required to construct two (2) buildings at the Wright Patterson AF base in Dayton Ohio.  The new Marine Corps Reserve Center administration facility (36,231sf ) will be located near gate 15. The new VMF will be located close to the new MCRC administration facility.  New facilities will be connected to the existing base electrical emergency power and utilities. Air Force BEAP requires precast concrete as an exterior wall finish system to match existing precast concrete structures.  Concrete block exterior walls are not acceptable according to base Air Force BEAP requirements. The facilities will be fully sprinkled for fire protection. Information systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning will be provided.  POV and Tactical vehicle pavement for parking; and site fencing is required.  Marine Corps Reserve Center will require administr!  ation offices, classrooms, drill hall, medical offices, medical equipment storage, and personal vehicle parking for reservists to support the mission of the MP Company C.  The Vehicle Maintenance Facility will provide two enclosed vehicle maintenance bays along with support spaces arranged appropriately providing sufficient space for the maintenance of the Battalions military vehicles. Included in adjacent areas to the VMF are a washrack, Quadcon storage area, a portal ramp and tactical vehicle parking.  The successful proposer will be required to validate the design against the RFP requirements and accept design responsibility (i.e. sign and seal design drawings and specifications by registered professional engineers and architects).  The RFP will provide the project program, site survey, hazardous materials investigations, and prescriptive and performance specifications.  The RFP will not include a floor plan or design solution. The estimated cost of the entire project is in the range of $9,500,000 to $10,500,000.  The NAICS Code for this proposed procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction and the annual size standard is NTE $31 Million.   Phase I Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available for viewing and downloading on or about 1 March 2008.  Proposal due date will be 28 March 2008, 2:00 p.m. Central Time.  The solicitation is formatted as an RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the Two-Phase Design-Build section procedures of FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors? proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government. This solicitation will consist of two (2) phases.  Phase I is the qualification phase.  Up to five (5) firms will be pre-qualified to participate in Phase II.  The Navy will determine which offerors proceed to Phase II.  The evaluation factors for Phase I are as follows:  Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience, Technical Qualifications, Small Business Sub-Contracting Effort, and Management Approach.  Upon determination of the contractors advancing to Phase II, those offerors will receive an RFP containing current and future design specifications.  Phase II will include the following evaluation factors:  Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience, Technical Qualifications and Management Approach (same as Phase I unless conditions change); Small Business Sub-Contracting Effort; Conceptual Facilities Design; Durability, Maintainability, Sustainability of Building Systems; and Project Schedule and Phasing. The Government intends on issuing the RFP Solicitation for Phase I and Phase II through the Internet at www.neco.navy.mil.  All prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  The download time may be excessive, but all contractors are encouraged to attempt download prior to obtaining the solicitation through alternate sources.  Many firms and commercial printing services have the capability to print the solicitation package and plan holders list off the Internet, if necessary.  The official plan holders list will be created by registration and be available from the website only.  Amendments will also be posted on the website for downloading.  This will be the normal method for distributing amendments, therefore it is the offerors? responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.   Offers will not be publicly opened.  The number of offers received, the identity of the offers received, the amount of any offer or relative standing of the offers will not be disclosed to anyone until the time of contract award.   IMPORTANT NOTICE:  All contractors submitting bids, proposals or quotes on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of the contract.  The purpose of this database is to provide basic business information, capabilities and financial information to the Government.  The CCR website can be accessed at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following Commercial item/services:  Hurricane Imaging Radiometer Receiver Project Organization The Marshall Space Flight Center will manage the HIRAD program and support the overall system design and integration.	The HIRAD team consisting of civil servants, university collaborators and contractor support who will be responsible for the completion of all critical tasks outlined and managed by the HIRAD management team.  The instrument development team consists of members from the University of Michigan, University of Central Florida, University of Alabama in Huntsville and NOAA.  HIRAD System Overview The HIRAD instrument operates in the 4 to 7GHz range specifically for ocean surface wind, precipitation, and sea surface temperature observations and tropical cyclone research studies from a high altitude aircraft platform.  The multi-resonant phased array antenna will mate with ten receivers and additional electronics to form the final HIRAD instrument.  The development of these integrated receivers is a critical component to the success of the HIRAD instrument for both future aircraft and spaceflight applications of this technology.   OBJECTIVES The science objective for the HIRAD instrument is passive remote sensing of hurricane winds and rain.  The objective of these requirements is to define the integrated receiver key parameters that will provide a low risk development path to the HIRAD aircraft instrument.   Customer Definition and Advocay The HIRAD instrument is a cooperative NASA & National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration?s Hurricane Research Division (NOAA, HRD) team development effort with Marshall Space Flight Center as the management and integrator of the project.  HIRAD is being managed by the Science and Mission Systems Office of the Marshall Space Flight Center in collaboration with the University of Michigan, University of Central Florida and University of Alabama in Huntsville.  Potential customers could include tropical cyclone and Earth scientists requiring observations for basic and applied research. Receiver Description The HIRAD radiometer uses ten receivers that are phase and amplitude matched so that signals from each pair of receivers can be cross correlated.  The antenna signal input to each receiver is supplied by a multi-resonant phased array antenna.  A single antenna signal contains frequency components centered at each of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and 6.6 GHz.  The exact center frequencies are subject to modification pending final testing of the antenna subsystem.  The receiver downconvert these signals sequentially in time to a common IF center frequency of 62.5 MHz.  An external LO signal is fed into the receivers that sequentially steps through the four necessary difference frequencies.  Ambient and active cold matched loads are contained inside each receiver for calibration purposes, as well as a directional coupler to inject an external noise diode signal.  Selection between the antenna and two internal matched loads is made by an internal calibration switch that is externally controlled.	The analog IF signals are output from the receivers and sent to a bank of ten digitizers, the outputs of which are sent to a digital cross correlator. This procurement is for ten individual channels of the below design each housed in a separate enclosure specified below as an integrated microwave receiver. Antenna Input Signal The antenna input connector type is SMA female.  Inside the receiver, the antenna signal should pass directly into an isolator and then to the Cal switch.  Figure 1 shows typical placement of the receivers on the back side of the antenna array.  These are not the size of the receivers but allowable area for placement.  Further details are discussed below. Input Signal The LO input connector type is SMA female.  The LO signal entering the receiver will have a nominal strength of ?10 dBm into 50 ohms and a variable, stepped frequency of 3.9375, 4.9375, 5.9375, or 6.5375 GHz.	Inside the receiver, the LO signal should be amplified before reaching the internal downconversion mixer.  This booster amp will elevate the LO power level to a strength needed to pump the mixer and will also provide additional isolation of RF and IF signals between receivers.   The exact LO frequencies to be used are subject to change pending final chamber testing of the frequency selective HIRAD antenna. Noise Diode Input Signal The noise diode input connector type is SMA female.  Inside the receiver, the noise diode signal should pass directly to the internal directional coupler without any other processing.  The noise diode signal will cover an RF passband of at least 3.9 ? 6.7 GHz.  	 (See attached Figure 1-Backside of Full Array) RF Passband Frequencies Four distinct passbands, with the following center frequency / 1 dB, 3 dB, 24 dB bandwidths: 4.0 GHz / 70, 75, 90 MHz 5.0 GHz / 45, 50, 65 MHz 6.0 GHz / 45, 50, 65 MHz 6.6 GHz / 70, 75, 90 MHz The specified 1 dB bandwidth is a lower bound value.  It can be any number between the specified value and the 3 dB value.   The specified 24 dB bandwidth is an upper bound value.	It can be any number between the 3 dB value and the specified value.   Both the center frequencies and bandwidths are subject to change pending final chamber testing of the frequency selective HIRAD antenna. Internal Calibration Sources There are three input signal options: 1) external signal entering antenna input port	 2) internal ambient matched load 3) internal active cold load  Selection between the three sources is made by a SP3T switch (Cal switch).  A 20dB directional coupler follows the Cal switch. It couples the external noise diode signal onto the input signal that is selected by the Cal switch.   The internal active cold load is a reverse LNA with its normal output port terminated and its normal input port used as the output port of the cold load.  If the return loss looking into the cold load output port is worse than 23 dB (i.e. if the S11 of the LNA is above ?23 dB) then the cold load should be followed by an isolator to raise the return loss of the combined LNA/isolator above 23 dB.	The brightness temperature of the cold load should be below 150 K between 3.9 and 6.7 GHz.   Low Noise Amplifier and Receiver Noise Figure A broadband low noise amplifier (LNA) follows the Cal switch and directional coupler.  The LNA passband should cover the complete 3.9 ? 6.7 GHz signal bandwidth.  The noise figure of the LNA should not exceed 1.0 dB over the full signal bandwidth.  The end-to-end noise figure of the complete receiver, referenced to the antenna input port, should not exceed 2.8 dB.  The receiver noise figure includes the effects of insertion loss by the isolator, SP3T Cal switch, and noise diode directional coupler in addition to the noise figure of the LNA. Inter-unit Phase and Amplitude Matching The phase and amplitude of the end-to-end signal flow, from RF input to IF output, must be sufficiently well matched across each of the four passbands for any pair of receivers.  This is true for both the antenna and noise diode input ports.  The difference in phase between any pair of receivers must be less than 5o across the 1 dB bandwidth and less than 15o across the 3 dB bandwidth.  The difference in amplitude between any pair of receivers must be less than 1.5 dB across the 3 dB bandwidth.   IF Output Signal The receiver will downconvert the selected RF signal to an IF passband centered at 62.5 MHz.  The output IF signal strength will be 0 dBm into a 50 ohm load when the RF input is a matched load at 290 K physical temperature.  The output connector type is SMA female.  Digital Control Input Signals Three digital control lines are input to the receiver to select one of the three positions of the Cal switch.  The logic level of these signals is 3.3V single-ended CMOS.  Suggested connector type is 9 pin micro-D female.   Thermal Monitoring Housekeeping Lines Temperature sensors should be installed to monitor:  1) the internal ambient matched load  2) the isolator at the antenna input port  3) the noise diode directional coupler  4) the RF low noise amplifier   Output signal lines from the temperature sensors should exit the receiver package through one of its side connectors. DC Input Power Conditioned DC power supply voltages will be supplied to the receiver at suitable voltage levels (e.g. 5, +/-12, +/-15 or 28 volts) needed to bias internal active devices.  Required voltage levels and nominal and maximum current required during power up and steady state operation should be specified by the vendor. Mechanical The outer dimensions of the receiver package shall be no more than 2.0 cm thick.  The input and output connectors (including control signals, housekeeping lines, and power supplies) should all be located along the thin (2.0 cm) sides, so that the receivers can be installed immediately adjacent to one another.  The antenna input port should be located on one side by itself, away from the LO and noise diode input ports, to improve isolation between them.  Figure 2 (Attached) shows a proposed layout of the receivers over a partial set of antenna elements with the board and mounting structure removed for clarity.   This layout is being developed and is subject to change but is provided as a reference for physical size and dimensioning.  The blue elements in the antenna array are the active elements that will be combined through a beam former (not shown).  The beam former combines the individual active elements of a linear array into a single signal that is sent to a receiver.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following: Hurricane Imaging Radiometer Receiver  Project Organization  The Marshall Space Flight Center will manage the HIRAD program and support the overall system design and integration. The HIRAD team consisting of civil servants, university collaborators and contractor support who will be responsible for the completion of all critical tasks outlined and managed by the HIRAD management team. The instrument development team consists of members from the University of Michigan, University of Central Florida, University of Alabama in Huntsville and NOAA.  HIRAD System Overview  The HIRAD instrument operates in the 4 to 7GHz range specifically for ocean surface wind, precipitation, and sea surface temperature observations and tropical cyclone research studies from a high altitude aircraft platform. The multi-resonant phased array antenna will mate with ten receivers and additional electronics to form the final HIRAD instrument. The development of these integrated receivers is a critical component to the success of the HIRAD instrument for both future aircraft and spaceflight applications of this technology.  OBJECTIVES  The science objective for the HIRAD instrument is passive remote sensing of hurricane winds and rain. The objective of these requirements is to define the integrated receiver key parameters that will provide a low risk development path to the HIRAD aircraft instrument.  Customer Definition and Advocay  The HIRAD instrument is a cooperative NASA & National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration?s Hurricane Research Division (NOAA, HRD) team development effort with Marshall Space Flight Center as the management and integrator of the project. HIRAD is being managed by the Science and Mission Systems Office of the Marshall Space Flight Center in collaboration with the University of Michigan, University of Central Florida and University of Alabama in Huntsville. Potential customers could include tropical cyclone and Earth scientists requiring observations for basic and applied research.  Receiver Description  The HIRAD radiometer uses ten receivers that are phase and amplitude matched so that signals from each pair of receivers can be cross correlated. The antenna signal input to each receiver is supplied by a multi-resonant phased array antenna. A single antenna signal contains frequency components centered at each of 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and 6.6 GHz. The exact center frequencies are subject to modification pending final testing of the antenna subsystem. The receiver downconvert these signals sequentially in time to a common IF center frequency of 62.5 MHz. An external LO signal is fed into the receivers that sequentially steps through the four necessary difference frequencies. Ambient and active cold matched loads are contained inside each receiver for calibration purposes, as well as a directional coupler to inject an external noise diode signal. Selection between the antenna and two internal matched loads is made by an internal calibration switch that is externally controlled. The analog IF signals are output from the receivers and sent to a bank of ten digitizers, the outputs of which are sent to a digital cross correlator.  This procurement is for ten individual channels of the below design each housed in a separate enclosure specified below as an integrated microwave receiver.  Antenna Input Signal  The antenna input connector type is SMA female. Inside the receiver, the antenna signal should pass directly into an isolator and then to the Cal switch. Figure 1 shows typical placement of the receivers on the back side of the antenna array. These are not the size of the receivers but allowable area for placement. Further details are discussed below.  Input Signal  The LO input connector type is SMA female. The LO signal entering the receiver will have a nominal strength of ?10 dBm into 50 ohms and a variable, stepped frequency of 3.9375, 4.9375, 5.9375, or 6.5375 GHz. Inside the receiver, the LO signal should be amplified before reaching the internal downconversion mixer. This booster amp will elevate the LO power level to a strength needed to pump the mixer and will also provide additional isolation of RF and IF signals between receivers.  The exact LO frequencies to be used are subject to change pending final chamber testing of the frequency selective HIRAD antenna.  Noise Diode Input Signal  The noise diode input connector type is SMA female. Inside the receiver, the noise diode signal should pass directly to the internal directional coupler without any other processing. The noise diode signal will cover an RF passband of at least 3.9 ? 6.7 GHz.  (See attached Figure 1-Backside of Full Array)  RF Passband Frequencies  Four distinct passbands, with the following center frequency / 1 dB, 3 dB, 24 dB bandwidths:  4.0 GHz / 70, 75, 90 MHz 5.0 GHz / 45, 50, 65 MHz 6.0 GHz / 45, 50, 65 MHz 6.6 GHz / 70, 75, 90 MHz  The specified 1 dB bandwidth is a lower bound value. It can be any number between the specified value and the 3 dB value.  The specified 24 dB bandwidth is an upper bound value. It can be any number between the 3 dB value and the specified value.  Both the center frequencies and bandwidths are subject to change pending final chamber testing of the frequency selective HIRAD antenna.  Internal Calibration Sources  There are three input signal options: 1) external signal entering antenna input port 2) internal ambient matched load 3) internal active cold load  Selection between the three sources is made by a SP3T switch (Cal switch). A 20dB directional coupler follows the Cal switch. It couples the external noise diode signal onto the input signal that is selected by the Cal switch.  The internal active cold load is a reverse LNA with its normal output port terminated and its normal input port used as the output port of the cold load. If the return loss looking into the cold load output port is worse than 23 dB (i.e. if the S11 of the LNA is above ?23 dB) then the cold load should be followed by an isolator to raise the return loss of the combined LNA/isolator above 23 dB. The brightness temperature of the cold load should be below 150 K between 3.9 and 6.7 GHz.  Low Noise Amplifier and Receiver Noise Figure  A broadband low noise amplifier (LNA) follows the Cal switch and directional coupler. The LNA passband should cover the complete 3.9 ? 6.7 GHz signal bandwidth. The noise figure of the LNA should not exceed 1.0 dB over the full signal bandwidth. The end-to-end noise figure of the complete receiver, referenced to the antenna input port, should not exceed 2.8 dB. The receiver noise figure includes the effects of insertion loss by the isolator, SP3T Cal switch, and noise diode directional coupler in addition to the noise figure of the LNA.  Inter-unit Phase and Amplitude Matching  The phase and amplitude of the end-to-end signal flow, from RF input to IF output, must be sufficiently well matched across each of the four passbands for any pair of receivers. This is true for both the antenna and noise diode input ports. The difference in phase between any pair of receivers must be less than 5o across the 1 dB bandwidth and less than 15o across the 3 dB bandwidth. The difference in amplitude between any pair of receivers must be less than 1.5 dB across the 3 dB bandwidth.  IF Output Signal  The receiver will downconvert the selected RF signal to an IF passband centered at 62.5 MHz. The output IF signal strength will be 0 dBm into a 50 ohm load when the RF input is a matched load at 290 K physical temperature. The output connector type is SMA female.  Digital Control Input Signals  Three digital control lines are input to the receiver to select one of the three positions of the Cal switch. The logic level of these signals is 3.3V single-ended CMOS. Suggested connector type is 9 pin micro-D female.  Thermal Monitoring Housekeeping Lines  Temperature sensors should be installed to monitor: 1) the internal ambient matched load 2) the isolator at the antenna input port 3) the noise diode directional coupler 4) the RF low noise amplifier  Output signal lines from the temperature sensors should exit the receiver package through one of its side connectors.  DC Input Power  Conditioned DC power supply voltages will be supplied to the receiver at suitable voltage levels (e.g. 5, +/-12, +/-15 or 28 volts) needed to bias internal active devices. Required voltage levels and nominal and maximum current required during power up and steady state operation should be specified by the vendor.  Mechanical  The outer dimensions of the receiver package shall be no more than 2.0 cm thick. The input and output connectors (including control signals, housekeeping lines, and power supplies) should all be located along the thin (2.0 cm) sides, so that the receivers can be installed immediately adjacent to one another. The antenna input port should be located on one side by itself, away from the LO and noise diode input ports, to improve isolation between them.  Figure 2 (Attached) shows a proposed layout of the receivers over a partial set of antenna elements with the board and mounting structure removed for clarity. This layout is being developed and is subject to change but is provided as a reference for physical size and dimensioning.  The blue elements in the antenna array are the active elements that will be combined through a beam former (not shown). The beam former combines the individual active elements of a linear array into a single signal that is sent to a receiver. This single connection to the antenna array will be an SMA connector mounted just before the receiver boxes. To accommodate the two adjacent active rows of antenna elements the receivers can either be placed side by side as noted above or interspersed about the center line of the antenna array as shown below. (See Attached Figure 2-HIRAD receiver typical layout)  Thermal  The receivers should be able to meet all performance specifications over an operating temperature range of 10 C to 40 C. Within this range, any pair of receivers can differ in temperature from one another by at most 5 degrees Celsius.  Deliverable Items  This procurement will consist of ten receiver channels as described above with the option of two additional spares. There will be at least one review of the final design by the HIRAD team before production of the receivers is to begin. Delivery of the first receiver is to be no longer than 6 months from time of award with the remaining receivers following over a 60 day period.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   NAICS code 541990:  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Tracey Woodruff of the University of California, San Francisco. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows for negotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source. Project Identification:	Workshop(S) on Applications of Mechanistic Information in Human Health Risk Assessment BACKGROUND Among the major challenges in risk assessment is to incorporate scientific  advances and mechanistic information regarding the relationship between exposures to environmental contaminants and adverse health outcomes.  Mechanistic information can inform issues such as the relative human sensitivity to effects observed in laboratory animals, and the variability of response  within the human population.  Several collaborative groups have developed frameworks for analyzing and utilizing information about a chemical?s mode of action (MOA) in human health risk assessment of environmental carcinogens and toxicants, including the International Programme on Chemical Safety,  International Life Sciences Institute and US Environmental Protection Agency.  A recent critical review of these MOA frameworks identified several gaps and opportunities for progress (Guyton et al., J. Tox Environ Health, Part B, 11: 1-16, 2008).  These include addressing known causes of human  disease and the potential for chemical effects to act additively with these as well as endogenous background processes.  Another area for improvement is to consider multiple MOAs over the same dose range, or of varying MOAs resulting from exposure at different life stages.  Instead of considering  each MOA and outcome individually, the contribution of multiple metabolites, modes, and toxicity pathways to the overall toxicological profile could be addressed.  This would facilitate the application of toxicogenomic data covering multiple genes, molecular targets, and toxicity pathways in the  risk assessment process.  In keeping with this view, a recent NAS panel highlighted areas such as identifying toxicity pathways and exploring simultaneous alteration of multiple pathways as among the key considerations for future toxicity testing strategies.  Finally, the attendant quantitative  implications?particularly how to address toxicodynamic differences across species?also deserve further consideration.   The overall goal of this project is to address these issues in the context of recent scientific advances regarding human disease mechanisms.  The project aims to promote  interdisciplinary dialogue among scientists from academic, government (federal/state) and public/private organizations regarding the application of emerging science in decision making.  Specifically, the project shall entail developing synthesis and reviews of scientific literature, convening a  workshop to evaluate case studies of how new information can be concretely incorporated into hazard and dose-response assessments, and developing recommendations on new approaches to be incorporated in hazard and risk assessment frameworks.   A central theme of this project is the application of  evolving mechanistic information in human health risk assessment decisions.  Recent evidence to be examined in this context includes the multiple toxicity pathways controlling response to exposures, the windows of susceptibility, and the complex interactions that can result from multiple exposures  common within the population. Specific topics to be covered include: background diseases, exposures, and processes;  multiple mechanisms of toxicity for environmental agents-- and how they might interact with each other and background processes and can be used to identify susceptible  subpopulation; consideration of mechanisms contributing to human disease (e.g., leukemia), and the likelihood that the necessary causative factors associated with environmental agents already exist within human population subgroups;  associated quantitative considerations (including how to address  toxicodynamic differences across and within species, quantitative approaches to use of biomarkers/markers of adversity, etc).   SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION Dr. Tracey Woodruff is solely qualified to perform the work described in this project, based on her special expertise and experience in the  project area.  Her expertise in reproductive health as well as environmental policy will be especially valuable to this effort.  In addition, no one with her qualifications is available to perform the work during the time frame specified.  Dr. Woodruff serves as the Director of the Program on  Reproductive Health and the Environment in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at UCSF.  Prior to joining UCSF, Dr. Woodruff served as a Senior Scientist in the National Center for Environmental Economics, Office of Policy, Economics and Innovation at US EPA.  She  received numerous US EPA awards for her exceptional service and dedication to improving public health, including two Gold Medals, a Silver Medal as well as two Bronze medals.  Among the numerous projects on which she had a leading role was the development of US EPA?s 2005 Supplemental Guidance for  Assessing Susceptibility from Early-Life Exposure to Carcinogens.  This guidance document addresses general issues pertaining to cancer risks associated with early-life exposures and presents comparative analyses of risks associated with early-life and adult exposures.  In addition, it provides  specific guidance on adjusting risk estimates using for carcinogens with a mutagenic MOA.  Because the current project will consider issues pertinent to the evaluation of risk based on MOA considerations, her expertise in this area will be particularly valuable.  In addition, her past experience  directly related to the current work includes serving as the co-organizing director of the 2007 UCSF/CHE Summit on Environmental Challenges to Reproductive Health and Fertility, and co-organizing a 2007 meeting entitled Moving Upstream: A Workshop on Evaluating Adverse Upstream Endpoints for  Improved Decision Making and Risk Assessment.  Dr. Woodruff has authored 45 peer-reviewed publications in her areas of expertise.  For further information about Dr. Woodruff?s expertise and accomplishments, please see the attached CV. STATEMENT OF WORK The contractor shall conduct the following  Tasks in accomplishing the objectives of this contract.  As detailed below, Tasks include proposal and Workplan development, planning committee activities facilitation, pre-workshop planning and logistical arrangements, travel arrangements, on-site meeting support and meeting documentation.     Task 1.  Establish Communication Within one week of award, the contractor shall convene a conference call with the Technical Project Officer (Contractor?s Officer Representative, COR) to clarify outstanding questions and confirm the schedule and specific tasks for the contract.  The contractor  shall also provide monthly (or more frequently, as needed) verbal status updates to the COR throughout the conduct of the contract.  The contractor shall initiate additional communication with the COR should developments arise that will affect the conduct or schedule of this contract. Task 2.   Provide a Workplan Within two weeks of the initial conference call with the COR, the contractor shall provide a Workplan that describes in detail the tasks and schedule to be conducted under this Contract.  This shall include a schedule for all activities specified under Tasks 3-8. Task 3.   Facilitate Planning Committee Activities  Working with the US EPA COR and US EPA staff, the contractor shall facilitate selection of a planning committee to develop a program appropriate to address the subject of the workshop.  The workshop process shall entail: The planning committee shall choose  from one to three different types of toxicological pathways that shall be developed into case studies for the workshop.  Possibilities include thyroid disruption; immunosuppression; anti-androgen related toxicities; and pathways that could lead to childhood leukemia.  Selected pathways shall be  well-characterized and attributed to a number of different chemicals, thus providing the ability to address multiple chemicals with a particular case study.  In addition, sufficient information should be available to develop quantitative relationships between exposures and different metrics of  outcomes. The planning committee shall develop an outline of the issues to be addressed in each of the case studies.  The case studies shall focus on one or more representative chemicals with sufficient scientific information to illustrate key concepts.  The case studies shall synthesize the  relevant science with specific examples of how the scientific information can be used in hazard and risk assessment considering the key areas listed above.  A group of scientists along with a representative from the planning committee shall be selected to develop each case study.  Each case study  shall be developed into a working paper.  The working papers shall be discussed at a workshop.   The workshop shall attempt to synthesize the findings and develop specific suggestions from the case studies and approaches for incorporating information in dose-response analysis.   The workshop format  shall be determined by the US EPA in consultation with the contractor, but is anticipated to include one and a half days of presentations and panel discussions, with on focus on finalizing 2-3 case studies that explore the attendant issues.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Bruker Biospin Corporation, 15 Fortune Drive Billerica, MA 01821-3923, to provide a package consisting of a computer, software and installation. This requirement is being sole sourced because the package, in operation, must run and correctly interface with a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer made by the same vendor, Bruker Biospin Inc.  The software codes, timing, and interface connections are all proprietary and require an interface board in the computer which can properly communicate with the spectrometer. A windows computer is part of this requirement, because of the customized interfaces and the need to have the system run the spectrometer with total compatibility.
A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about February 23, 2008.
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Dr. Arnold Kaluzny; 102 Pine Lane, Chapel Hill North Carolina 27514, to provide external review and internal evaluation of DCP?s large program areas. 

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard in $6.5M.  This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106.

The NCI has identified a need for the review of their research group programs (e.g. the Biometry Research Group (BRG), the Nutritional Science Research Group (NSRG) and the four Organ Systems Research Groups (Breast and Gynecologic Cancer [BGCRG], Gastrointestinal and Other Cancer [GOCRG], Lung and Upper Aerodigestive Cancer [LUACRG], and Prostate and Urology Cancer [PUCRG])  in order to assure these programs are meeting the objectives and contributing to the overall mission of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  To achieve this objective a set of review and evaluation activities are proposed: (a) the development and implementation of an external review process to assess the status of large DCP research groups (e.g. BRG, NSRG and OSRGs). 

Contractor Requirements: Contractor shall develop and implement a external review and evaluation process to assess the status of selected research groups (BRG, NSRG and OSRGs); make recommendations to the NCI program staff to compile a background paper describing the present status of each program area, select and define measurable performance criteria and define specific evaluation questions to be addressed by an external review panel selected for each program and semi structured interviews of program staff to name a few.  

Dr. Kaluzny is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the expertise to make objective evaluations of the NCIs large scale alliance type programs.  His research and expertise focuses on organizational factors affecting program implementation and change in a variety of health care organizations with specific emphasis on cancer treatment, prevention and control; continuous quality improvement initiatives in organization and in primary care settings as well as alliances within health care.

<SUBJECT>99 -- HMMWV Industrial Based Production
<SOLNBR>SPM7L1-08-R-0006
<RESPDATE>042108
<ARCHDATE>05062008
<CONTACT>Patty Snyder, Contract Specialist, Phone 614-692-1127, Email patty.snyder@dscc.dla.mil - Carla Pennington, Contract Specialist, Phone 614-692-1234, Email carla.pennington@dscc.dla.mil
<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Columbus is issuing a solicitation in support of HMMWV Industrial Based Production Programs.  This contract is the follow-on to replace the Customer Pay contract, SP0750-06-D-9711, which expires in December 2008.  The awardee will function as a Prime Services Integrator (PSI ) for three separately described but integrated services required to effectively and efficiently support the HMMWV industrial production programs: 1) Technical support to apply best manufacturing and repair practices to any Full or Tailored Implementation Sites, currently Red River Army Depot (RRAD) and Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) which are full implementation sites and Maine Military Authority (MMA) which is a tailored site; 2) Repair parts, components and kits support to accomplish the required repairs and upgrades; and 3) Operation of a dual supply system for replenishing (i.e. ?pushing?) the required parts using proven just-in-time supply practices.  Under the dual supply system each part/NSN provided under this contract will have a primary source assignment- either the Government material is to be used (Gov?t. 1st Source), or the contractors material is to be used (Contractor 1st Source). The dual supply system is activated when parts are not available in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements. At that point the contractor will either obtain parts from DLA (for Contractor first sourced items that they cannot provide) or the contractor must provide their parts for items first source to the Government.  This dual supply system requires the contractor to price every item being supplied under this contract and to have the capability to supply Government first sourced parts with little or no lead time.  The measurable goal of acquiring these parts and services is to produce a better product to the field, faster and at a lower cost.  

The Statutory Authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1.  It has been determined by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) that AM General LLC, 105 Niles Avenue, South Bend, IN 46617, as the developer and sole manufacturer of the HMMWV, is the only firm with the technical expertise and in-place logistics system necessary to meet the requirements of this solicitation.

This acquisition is for a requirements type contract to include functional support services as well as parts support for any HMMWV part for any HMMWV variant, both current and future.  The initial population of items to be priced is approximately 2000 items in support of the Army industrial based production programs, of which approximately 50% are estimated to be awarded as a first source to the contractor.  Additional parts and implementation sites may be added as needed. The acquisition item descriptions for these approximate 2,000 items included in this initiative will include the NSN/Part Number, nomenclature, and technical data, including quality requirements. This will be provided as an attachment to the solicitation.

The contractor shall provide functional support services for items on the contract. This will include:

(1)	supply of proprietary and non-proprietary items
(2)	management of inventory
(3)	forecasting customer requirements and ?pushing? supplies to the production line
(4)	system engineering and technical support
(5)	synchronize supply distribution to meet depot and operational requirements
(6)	rapid response manufacturing for priority requirements
(7)  kitting of identified items as required
(8)  recommend improvements to maximize production line efficiency


The contractor will store and maintain title to contractor owned inventory until the point of consumption by the customer. The stock will be held at either Government locations or Contractor warehouses near depot production sites, currently at RRAD and LEAD.  As the contractor will maintain ownership of the stock until consumption, the contractor will be responsible for maintaining a discrete level of safety stock suitable to prevent stock outs.  The contractor will have visibility of stock attrition to effectively plan and ramp up and forecast the requirements.  The contractor will also store, manage, and forecast inventory for Government sourced parts, with the Government retaining title to the inventory until point of consumption.  

This procurement will be made on an All or None basis to streamline processes.  This will also help to ensure award is made to a sole qualified contractor with experience and capability providing these parts and to serve as a complete prime system integrator. It is again important to note that the demands supported by this procurement are over and above ?normal? operational requirements.

All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.

The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total duration (base plus option years) shall not exceed 5 years.

Conditions for Evaluation and Acceptance of Offers for Part Numbered items applies.

Solicitations will be issued upon request.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Medical Expert(s)- Rheumatology
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFP-08-1044
<CONTACT>S. Kyle Roberts, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-9492, Fax 410-966-9310, Email S.Kyle.Roberts@ssa.gov - Dawn Caracci, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-965-9465, Fax 410-966-9310, Email dawn.caracci@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a solicitation, set-aside for small business participation only, to obtain the services of one to five experienced, licensed Rheumatologists, who are board certified and/or have SSA disability program experience at the State and/or Federal level, or in the absence of board certification, have SSA disability program experience combined with specialized training, to serve as Medical Experts to analyze and provide expert advice related to their specialized field, as needed, so that adjudicators can render accurate determinations and decisions.  

BACKGROUND:  SSA is responsible for two national disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  SSA uses a five-step sequential process for evaluating the disability claim submitted by an individual who alleges an inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA).  The program defines disability as an inability to engage in SGA by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  A medical basis for the disability claim is required, and the State disability determination services (DDS) collect and evaluate the medical information, making a determination about the severity of the medical and/or rheumatic impairment as it relates to the claimant?s ability to perform SGA.  

While many disability impairments may be properly evaluated by medical generalist, claims that involve difficult or complex issues require medical and/or rheumatology specialist and sub-specialist expertise. 
SSA anticipates the award of one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with provisions for the issuance of Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) task orders as needed.  The IDIQ period of performance will be for a 12-month base period, with four 12-month option periods.   SSA?s estimated date for release of the solicitation is on/about February 21, 2008, of which proposals will be due approximately 20 days from the date of release.   Any amendments or other information relative to the solicitation will be posted to this website (www.fedbizopps.gov).  As such, interested sources are encouraged to REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION.  Hard copies of the solicitation and any related information will NOT be provided.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All questions must be submitted via email to s.kyle.roberts@ssa.gov.

<DESC>Notice of Intent:  Under Statutory Authority ýý 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) the Government anticipates entering into sole source procurement negotiations with Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, to perform the following research:  In collaboration between VA Hines and Drexel University, the two entities shall perform research to study clinically relevant therapeutic approaches to the treatment of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), as required in the Combat Casualty Initiative, by implanting steroid pellets into rats in a model that both represents the type of injury seen in humans and yet is reproducible enough to be utilized in animal studies.  The above authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by supplies/services available from one source.  This announcement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR 6.302-1.  Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by February 15, 2008.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interest received on or before February 15, 2008 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, intends to issue a solicitation for the LAP of MACS  increments for the M231 and M232A1 Propelling Charges to support FY08 - FY11  production quantities.  The MACS meets the Armyýýýs requirements for 155mm  artillery Propelling Charges to be used in all existing 155mm artillery weapon  systems and is designed for use with automated handling equipment incorporated  in the future Non-Line-Of-Sight Cannon (NLOS-C) system. The MACS are two  different Propelling Charges (the low-zone M231 and the high-zone M232A1),  which provide a complete zoning solution for the 155mm artillery applications  by using multiples of the basic modules. The LAP effort involves the final  assembly of the Propelling Charge from its components, packing into the  shipping containers and transportation to various facilities for subsequent  testing.  The Government intends to award one Firm Fixed Priced contract for the LAP of  the M231 and M232A1 Propelling Charges, which will consist of a basic year  requirement (FY08) with 4 priced ýýýoverlappingýýý option quantities for FY08- FY11. ýýýOverlappingýýý options will include 2 year option exercise periods from  start to end of each overlapping option. The M231 and M232A1 LAP anticipated  option quantities and the maximum amount that can be ordered, at the  discretion of the Government, for each option are: FY08 ýýý 578,287; FY09 ýýý  933,594; FY10 ýýý 1,035,995; and FY11 ýýý 1,161,899.  The anticipated quantity for  the base year requirement is 557,020.   The Offeror must possess the necessary skills and facilities to fabricate and  deliver the above components.  Potential candidates must possess unique  contractor skills and technologies required from the LAP effort, which  includes a trained workforce that can safely handle and store various  energetic components and prepare them for their intended use and have the  necessary production machinery. Subject to approval, competition is limited to  United States and Canadian sources. The technical data package (TDP) is  available from the Procuring Contracting Officer upon request.

<DESC>The Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&L LCMC) Acquisition Center at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the procurement of an XM205 Lightweight Tripod for Heavy Machine Guns.  This system shall be capable of mounting to both the M2/M2A1.50 Caliber Machine Gun and the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG).  This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.  An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with two (2) Options will be utilized.  Additional information will be provided in the RFP. The lightweight tripod system will reduce the weight and size burden of the M3 tripod yet enable the soldier to deliver a high degree of accurate fire from a stable base.  The XM205 Machine Gun Tripod shall have the following characteristics: 1) Weight no more than 31 lbs (T); 25 lbs (O). 2) The tripod must be capable of mounting both the M2 .50 Caliber and MK19 machine guns without the need for special/unauthorized adapters.  The tripod shall be compatible with the standard, current machine gun mounts and pintles (e.g. MK93 Carriage and Cradle; NSN 1010-01-502-7547, .50 Cal Machine Gun pintle; NSN 1010-01-151-6217.)  The tripod components shall interface with the current mounting locations of the M2 .50 Cal MG or MK19 GMG without permanent modifications to these mounting features.  Non-permanent adaptors made to the weapons are acceptable. 3) A Traverse and Elevation (T&E) mechanism that is integral to the tripod. The T&E mechanism shall permit controlled manipulation in both traverse and elevation by hand force of the User, allow for rapid and bold adjustment throughout the full range of traverse and elevation, and 1 mil fine adjustment capability.  A self-contained unit that provides position (elevation and azimuth) display is desired. 4) A T&E that allows for rapid and bold adjustment.  T&E display provides weapon elevation and azimuth during bold adjustments. 5) The tripod shall collapse to less than 50% of its deployed width and height for ease of transportation.  Overall length and width of the LTHMG shall not exceed 45 inches and 7.75 inches (not including the width across feet on tripod legs) respectively in the collapsed configuration.  The tripod shall capable of being folded, collapsed or otherwise reduced in size, without disassembly, into a compact package for storage and transporting during Airborne operations. 6) Have a geometry that takes advantage of the full range and versatility of the M2 .50 Caliber and MK19 machine guns and allows the weapons to maintain consistent elevation/depression throughout the full range of weapon traverse. The deployed height of the tripod shall have a minimum height to accommodate firing from the sitting and prone positions. This is not an RFP; the release of a RFP is antcipated on or about 3 March 2008.  Questions shall be submitted in writing to the U.S. Army JM&L LCMC, Attn: Yasmine Clanton, Contract Specialist, at yasmine.clanton@us.army.mil. TELEPHONE INQUIRES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. See note 1

<DESC>The Northwestern Division of the US Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) services required for execution of the environmental mission in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Northwestern Division (CENWD).   This A-E selection will be conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 36.6.  The majority of the work will be in support of the Seattle District mission; howev er, the resulting contract will include work at various locations throughout the Northwestern Division boundaries.<BR><BR>More than one contract is being awarded for the same scope of work; however, under the Brooks Act, price competition is not allowed fo r A-E contracts.  Therefore, each firm will be afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order in excess of $3,000 except as provided by FAR 16.505(b)(2), using the following process.  When a requirement is identified the Government Projec t Delivery Team will first determine if it is a new requirement or a follow-on effort to an existing remediation project.  Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasi bility study and then design.  If a follow-on requirement, every effort will be made to assign the task order to the original A-E as long as they have the capability to perform.  For new requirements, the project scope will be reviewed to determine whether  the requirement can be accomplished using a firm fixed-price task order or whether uncertainties will require the use of a cost reimbursement task order.  Only the unrestricted pool will be considered for cost reimbursement task orders.  The experience, q ualifications, past performance, capability and capacity will be considered as well as how we are doing in meeting our small business goals to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work.  The period of performance for the IDC will begin on the date of contract award and will be in effect for one twelve-month base period; in addition there are provisions for four twelve-month option periods.  if all options are exercised the length of the contract will be five years.  The period of perform ance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement, and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. The Service Contract Act, as amended 1965, is applicable to this solicitatio n and resulting contracts and will be incorporated into same.  Selections are expected to be made by 7 May 2008 after which those firms will be notified and issued a request for proposal; after negotiations awards are expected sometime during August  Sept ember 2008.  Place of contract performance for most of the work will be done at the A-E contractors office.<BR><BR>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. In support of the acquisition effort to acquire A-E services required to execute the environmental mission in the USAC E Northwestern Division, the Government intends to award contracts to as many as five unrestricted firms; in addition to pool of unrestricted contracts two contracts to 8(a) set asides; two contracts to HUBZones; and two contracts to Service-Disabled Veter an-owned small business concerns.  Of the three small business categories one in each will be awarded by Kansas City District and one by Seattle District for projects relative to those Districts.  In the event the solicitation process for either the HubZon e or SDVOSB set-asides results in no firms being ranked as most highly qualified, the Government may proceed to make an award using the following process, which will be stated in the solicitation synopses:  <BR>	- HubZone:  for the synopsized contract capa city to first, the next most highly qualified ranked SDVOSB firm, then to the next most highly qualified ranked 8(a) firm, in that order until the lists are exh austed.  <BR>	- SDVOSB:  for the synopsized contract capacity to first, the next most highly qualified ranked HubZone firm, then to the next most highly qualified ranked 8(a) firm,   in that order until the lists are exhausted.  <BR>Should the above proces s not result in the Government's ability to make an award, the capacity may be rolled over among the 5 unrestricted solicitation/resulting contracts.  <BR><BR>EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Selection of 8(a) firm will be based on the following criteria listed in de scending order of importance.

The majority of the work will be in support of Seattle District mission; however, the resulting contract will include work at various locations throughout the Northwestern Division boundaries.<BR><BR>More than one contract is being awarded for the same scope of work; however, under the Brooks Act, price competition is not allowed for A- E contracts.  Therefore, each firm will be afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order in excess of $3,000 except as provided by FAR 16.505(b)(2), using the following process.  When a requirement is identified the Government Project De liver Team will first determine if it is a new requirement or a follow-on effort to an existing remediation project.  Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibilit y study and then design.  If a follow-on requirement, every effort will be made to assign the task order to the original A-E as long as they have the capability to perform.  For new requirements, the project scope will be reviewed to determine whether the requirement can be accomplished using a firm fixed-price task order or whether uncertainties will require the use of a cost reimbursement task order.  Only the unrestricted pool will be considered for cost reimbursement task orders.  The experience, qualif ications, past performance, capability and capacity will be considered as well as how we are doing in meeting our small business goals to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work.  The period of performance for the IDC will begin on th e date of contract award and will be in effect for one twelve-month base period; in addition there are provisions for four twelve-month option periods; if all options are exercised the length of the contract will be five years. The period of performance fo r task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement, and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. The Service Contract Act, as amended 1965, is applicable to this solicitation and r esulting contracts and will be incorporated into same.   Selections are expected to be made by 7 May 2008 after which those firms will be notified and issued a request for proposal; after negotiations awards are expected sometime during August  September 2008.  Place of contract performance for most of the work will be done at the A-E contractors office.<BR><BR>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. In support of this acquisition effort to acquire A-E services required to execute the environmental mission in the USACE Nor thwestern Division, the Government intends to award contracts to as many as five unrestricted firms to share capacity; in addition to pool of unrestricted contracts two contracts to 8(a) set asides; two contracts to HUBZones; and two contracts to Service-D isabled Veteran-owned small business concerns.  Of the three small business categories one in each will be awarded by Kansas City District and one by Seattle District for projects relative to those Districts.  In the event the solicitation process for eith er the HubZone or SDVOSB set-asides results in no firms being ranked as most highly qualified, the Government may proceed to make an award using the following process, which will be stated in the solicitation synopses:<BR>	- HubZone:  for the synopsized co ntract capacity to first, the next most highly qualified ranked SDVOSB firm, then to the next most highly qualified ranked 8(a) firm, in that order until the li sts are exhausted.  <BR>	- SDVOSB:  for the synopsized contract capacity to first, the next most highly qualified ranked HubZone firm, then to the next most highly qualified ranked 8(a) firm,   in that order until the lists are exhausted.  <BR>Should the a bove process not result in the Government's ability to make an award, the capacity may be rolled over among the 5 unrestricted solicitation/resulting contracts.  <BR><BR>EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Selection of a Service Disabled Veteran-owned  firm will be base d on the following criteria listed in descending order of importance.  (1)   Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm in types of work required, including; (a) Remedial designs and corrective action designs.

Operation and Use of the Detroit Vehicle Infrastructure Integration Initiative Developmental Test Environment (DTE) following the Proof of Concept Test  

Agency:  RITA, DOT

Action: Notice, Request for Information (RFI)

Summary:  For approximately 4 years USDOT has conducted research in Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII). VII supports secure two-way communication between vehicles and between vehicles and the transportation infrastructure.  Potential application areas include safety (e.g., advanced brake warning between vehicles, intersection collision avoidance), public sector mobility (e.g., improved signal control and coordination) and commercial (e.g., off-board navigation, e-payment for services).  In order to operationally test the VII concept, USDOT established a VII Developmental Test Environment (DTE) in Detroit, Michigan and will conduct a Proof of Concept (POC) test in the winter and spring of 2008.  Following the POC, the US DOT may keep the Detroit Development Test Environment (DTE) operational, so that both US DOT sponsored VII testing can continue and so that other organizations may conduct live VII testing as well.  The USDOT is interested in receiving 1) input and expressions of interest in using the DTE by other private and public sector entities and 2) input and expressions of interest on options for continuing to operate and maintain this VII DTE.

The responses to this RFI may result in the government releasing a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a potential award of a contract to operate and maintain the DTE Michigan test site.

Due Date:  Comments and responses to the Questions should be received in writing on or before:
March 13, 2008. Submissions received after this date will also be considered to the extent possible.

Purpose of the Notice:

The purpose of this request for information is:

1)	To gauge interest in use of the DTE following the conclusion of the POC testing; 
2)	To determine how the DTE facility should be operated post POC;
3)	To determine interest from both commercial and non-commercial entities in operating, managing, and maintaining the DTE, including potential mechanisms (e.g., contract, cooperative agreement) and opportunities for cost sharing and/or cost-reimbursement basis;
4)	To determine a business model for managing the DTE that is acceptable both to the potential user community and to the USDOT.

Summary of questions: 

Answers to the following questions will help RITA to determine if and how the Detroit DTE should be maintained and operated post POC.  For clarity, the questions are divided into two areas - those for potential users and those with an interest in operating, managing, and maintaining the DTE.  However, it is recognized that an organization may fall into both categories, and therefore, respond to all questions.   

Questions for Potential Users

1)	Do you feel that continued use of the Detroit DTE will be worthwhile and of value to your VII-related work?
2)	If the Detroit DTE were available for use, would you use it?  What types of VII tests would you conduct?  Examples might include new applications, new technologies, new equipment, research, etc.  
3)	Do you agree with the proposed DTE usage principles defined below? What changes or alternatives, if any, would you recommend? 
4)	If the DTE were only available on a full fee-for service basis, recovering all costs, would you make use of it?
5)	Is the current configuration of the Detroit DTE adequate or is additional or less size/capability/capacity required for your possible use?  If changes are necessary to support your specific testing, what modifications do you feel should be made?   
6)	What recommendations, if any, do you have on the type of organization (e.g., for profit, not for profit, university, governmental, etc.) that should manage the Detroit DTE?

Questions for Potential Operators

1)	Do you agree with the proposed DTE usage principles defined below? What changes or alternatives, if any, would you recommend?
2)	What recommendations do you have concerning the business model for the operation of the DTE?  
3)	What cost sharing models should be considered?


Background:

Linking vehicles and the transportation infrastructure into an integrated, nationwide system has been a vision of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) for almost two decades.  Multiple studies indicate that doing so would provide significant safety benefits in preventing crashes as well as mobility benefits through the provision of real-time information on the road network, traffic flow, and weather conditions.  This information would enable travelers to make better decisions and allow transportation managers to more effectively manage the transportation system.  Accordingly, the Vehicle-Infrastructure Integration (VII) initiative was created to improve safety, mobility and commerce by deploying a secure communications infrastructure on roadways nationwide and in all production vehicles.

Because of the need for priority access to support safety critical-messages, initial efforts began with obtaining radio spectrum from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for safety applications in the 5.9GHz DSRC band. While DSRC is the only communication media currently being used in the Detroit DTE, other means of communication between the vehicle and infrastructure may be considered.  Early program activities focused on definition of the VII system, its requirements, and architecture.  An initial set of applications was defined and use cases were generated for them.  Some of these applications are considered public-sector applications; others such as e-payment are under the purview of the private-sector.  Several trial use standards were developed for the communications protocols.  During 2007, roadside and onboard vehicle equipment was designed and prototypes were constructed.  These were first tested in a laboratory environment at the component and integration levels and then tested on a closed test track.  Recent activities have focused on the establishment and use of a Development Test Environment in Michigan for continuation of Proof of Concept (POC) testing in a field environment.  During POC testing, application stubs will be used to test the capability of the VII architecture.  This POC testing will occur in the winter and spring of 2008.  

Description of the Detroit DTE Facility:  The DTE operates on the public highway network in a suburban area outside of Detroit Michigan.  A FHWA contractor is currently operating and maintaining this facility through the June 2008.  This network consists of 43 center-line miles of arterials and 32 center-line miles of freeways on I-96 and I-275.  Roadside Equipment (RSE) has been placed at 57 sites along this network.  The RSEs communicate with on-board equipment in vehicles using DSRC wireless communications.  Various communications technologies, including G3 cellular, T1 lines, and WiMAX, provide backhaul connectivity from the RSEs to a Service Delivery Node located at the Road Commission for Oakland County Michigan?s Traffic Operations Center, and an Enterprise Network Operations Center currently located at Booz Allen Hamilton?s facility in Herndon Virginia.  It is envisioned that future testbeds will be integrated into this overall VII network.  There are also interfaces between the Detroit DTE and High Accuracy National Differential GPS test sites.  Depending on the test environment requirements for follow-on use and available funding, the DTE could be maintained in its current configuration, reconfigured, downsized, or upsized.  

Principles of use concept for the DTE:  If it is determined that the Detroit DTE should be kept operational following the POC, the following are one possible set of operating principles.  The purpose of these principles is to define the ground rules and basic expectations for post POC DTE access, use, and maintenance.  They are provided in this RFI as additional information for consideration, and feedback on these or alternative operating principles is welcomed: 

1	Priority for use will be given to any efforts funded or sponsored by US DOT.
2	All other parties wishing to use the DTE for testing purposes shall have equal access to the facility.  
3	A process will be established for determining access schedules and for resolving schedule conflicts/overlapping access requests.  In the event of conflicting requests, or if the DTE is oversubscribed, the DTE manager will attempt to arrange a compromise acceptable to all parties.  If this cannot be done, the US DOT ITS JPO will make a final decision, based on their judgment of what is in the best interests of the overall VII program. 
4	The DTE manager will be responsible for developing and maintaining the DTE access procedures.  This will include the procedure for formally requesting access to the facility and the responsibilities of the requestor once use of the DTE is complete (e.g., tear down of the test setup.).
5	A set of usage guidelines (rules) will be developed by the DTE manager and made publicly available for all requestors.  The requestors are responsible for following the guidelines.  Failure to follow the guidelines may result in their lack of access to the DTE.
6	The existing DTE facility will be available free of charge to the requesting party.  Included in this shall be up to TBD hours of technical support and troubleshooting from the DTE manager.  If any additional support is required, the requestor will pay for those services (see next item).
7	If the requesting party requires special services (e.g., data collection, use of technical staff, etc.) as part of their use of the DTE, the requestor will pay for those services.  A list of available services and their cost/rates will be made publicly available.  All requesting parties will be charged the same for the available services.
8	The requesting party will assume all liability for damages, etc. due to their use of the DTE.  The requestor must demonstrate that they have sufficient liability insurance as part of requesting access to the DTE.  
9	The requesting party will pay for any damage they cause to the DTE itself.  If there is a dispute as to whether DTE failure is due to the DTE itself of the actions of the requestor, a third party arbitrator will determine responsibility (the requestor will pay for any damage they caused.) The DTE manager and the requestor shall agree to the decision of the arbitrator.
10	At the end of a requestor?s testing activities, the DTE must be returned to its state when the requestor?s testing began.
11	Requesters will use the DTE at their own risk.  Neither the DTE manager nor the US DOT will be responsible for any costs or damages, etc. caused by use of the DTE, nor will they be responsible for any costs caused by failure of the DTE to operate or to operate correctly.
12	If the DTE is not functioning or not functioning fully or correctly during the scheduled test time, negatively impacting the requester?s tests, the requester shall, at their request, be given 1st priority access to any previously unscheduled test capacity.  No other compensation or consideration shall be provided.
13	The manager of the DTE will respect the confidentiality of the requestor?s testing activities, and may enter into appropriate agreements to protect the requestor?s intellectual property.
14	The DTE manager will be responsible for maintaining and providing access to DTE operational and technical manuals.  The requestor agrees that neither the DTE manager nor any other party will be held financially responsible for any delays incurred due to errors in any of this technical documentation.
15	The requester shall comply with any and all rules and regulations set down by the state and local jurisdictions in which the DTE resides.
16	The requester is responsible for providing all vehicles and On Board Equipment to be used in any testing.

<DESC>Modification 1: Response date changed<BR>Please contact Dawn Hickman at Dawn.R.Hickman@nws02.usace.army.mil or 206-764-6575 for any questions regarding this project.  <BR><BR>The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a competitive requirement for c onstruction services on a project titled, FY08 Railroad Upgrade, Fort Lewis, Washington.  The project consists of constructing a facility that provides the following: <BR><BR>1) Expansion of the Interchange (IC) Yard in the Logistics Center, both widenin g and lengthening.  The design removes a total of 4 existing tracks on the south side and adds 3 new tracks on both the north and south sides of the main lines, for a total of 6 new lines, presently serving Ft. Lewis.  Total additional track in the IC Yard  area amounts to approximately 10,200 linear feet of track, ties and ballast as well as associated crossovers, highway grade crossing and all site work associated with the expansion of the IC Yard.  A gravel maintenance road is to be provided on both he no rth and south sides of the IC Yard.  New exterior lighting and fencing will be provided on the most of the perimeter of the new yard.  <BR><BR>2)  To accommodate expansion of the IC yard, East Lincoln Road and its rail crossing must be diverted and extende d around the new yard.  A sweeping S-curve alignment will be replicated approximately 1,200 feet east of the existing location.  The new road will include two 12-foot pavement sections and 4-foot gravel shoulders.  Normal pavement markings and signage ar e included, but only crossbuck signs at the rail crossing will be provided, without additional signalization.  <BR><BR>3) Construction of a new Locomotive Maintenance Facility (LMF) of approximately 5,800 square feet.  (Demolition of the existing LMF will be accomplished under separate contract.)  The new enclosed facility will provide maintenance and storage space for three locomotives along with a small office/breakroom space.  Approximately 800 linear feet of track, ties and ballast along with turnouts a re associated with the new entrance to the LMF from the IC lead tracks.  Track design follows the basic BNSF design of 12-foot shoulders, walkway ballast and drainage ditches on either side.  The rail design also incorporates a 2-panel at-grade crossing on  the east side of the building.  Shop equipment includes a 7.5-ton bridge crane, storage and pumps for lubricants and glycol, an air compressor, welding equipment, storage shelves, and a small exterior hazardous materials storage building for lubricants an d glycol.  The LMF will house the following spaces: a small office area, tool/janitor area, bathroom with shower, electrical and communications closets, the shop area (4900 sq. ft.) with a below-ground-surface maintenance pit for one locomotive space and s everal large overhead coiling doors.  The concrete slab is reinforced in the shop area for jacking a 120-ton locomotive.  The mechanical design incorporates high-intensity infrared heaters for the shop area and a split system, air-source heat pump for the small office/break room.  Fans and louvers provide summer ventilation and incorporate sensors and controls to exhaust fumes generated during short-duration operation of locomotives.  Roof is standing-seam metal, siding is metal with low-wall brick veneer.  Windows utilize laminated glass.  Building will be sprinklered with a wet-pipe system.  Construction means, methods and materials will result in a LEED-NC rating of silver on the LMF building.  <BR><BR>4)  Utility runs to the LMF include domestic and fire  water supply, electrical power, copper and fiber optic communication lines and stormwater management facilities.  Electrical service includes relocation of overhead to underground service a distance of approximately 2400 feet, including some additional ma nholes and concrete-encased raceway under roadways, connecting to a 225 kVA transformer outside the LMF, pad mounted on a concrete vault.  Some steel casing of lines beneath railroad track is required.  Sanitary Sewer service includes provision of a duplex grinder pump station and 2,240 feet of 1?-inch forced main and approximately 120-feet of 4-inch gravity main.  Water service will be provided by extension of a n 8-inch ductile iron main approximately 1,175 feet to the LMF site.  Stormwater facilities include a bioinfiltration facility receiving sheet flow and piped roof drainage.  Grade requirements may force importation of as much as 89,000 yards of suitable fi ll.  Unsuitable soils removal could amount to approximately 42,000 yards, emanating from approximately 1? feet of unsuitable material removal from the top of previously undeveloped areas.<BR><BR>The estimated construction cost range is $10,000,000-25,000,0 00 and the performance period is estimated at 365 calendar days.  The NAICS code for this project is 237990.  The solicitation will be a unrestricted competitive request for proposal utilizing the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable source selection proces s resulting in award of one fixed-price contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  This notice is for information and planning purposes only.  This is not a request for proposals and does not commit the government to award a contract; therefore, no solicitation is available at this time.  This requirement has classified aspects, and a DD Form 254 - Contract Security Classification Specification, will be attached to the anticipated solicitation and any resultant contract.

The Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) in the Coordinating Office for Terrorism Prevention and Emergency Response (COTPER) in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), contemplates a contract for laboratory support services for the Select Agent Programs to furnish educated, qualified, and trained personnel to provide technical and program support in select agent and import permit activities including support of laboratory inspection activities, records, management and control, data entry, regulatory support, and file management. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SPECIFIED DD FORM 254 CONTRACT SECURITY CLASSIFICATION SPECIFICATION. Qualified personnel must be able to enter highly classified government locations in order to perform the contract work. Therefore, many of the personnel who work on this requirement will need U.S. government security clearances at the SECRET level.

Public Law 107-188, The ?Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002,? requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in cooperation with the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), establish and enforce procedures for possession, use, and transfer of select agents.  Select agents are biological agents and toxins that are regulated under 42 CFR Part 73 that pose a severe threat to public health and safety.   The select agent regulations, 42 CFR Part 73, established requirements for facilities that possess, use, and transfer select agents. 

Currently, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT) has been delegated by the Secretary of HHS to ensure compliance with the select agent regulations.  These regulations are implemented so that the select agents are available for legitimate research purposes, but inaccessible to potential terrorists.    To ensure compliance, CDC must inspect and evaluate entities using the requirements outlined in the select agent regulations and known biosafety standards such as the CDC/NIH (National Institutes of Health) publication, "Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories" (BMBL), 29 CFR 1910.1450, ?Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories,? and the ?NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules.? 

The Public Health Service Foreign Quarantine Regulations (42 CFR, Section 71.54) govern the importation of etiological agents, hosts, and vectors of human disease into the United States.  A person may not import into the United States, nor distribute after importation, any etiologic agent or any arthropod or other animal host or vector of human disease, or any exotic living arthropod or other animal capable of being a host or vector of human disease unless accompanied by a permit issued by the Director of CDC. 

The CDC Etiologic Agent Import Permit Program (EAIPP) located within the Division of Select Agents and Toxins is responsible for the issuing CDC import permits.  Information is submitted to EAIPP, as required by the provisions of 42 CFR 71.54, for issuance of permits by CDC to importers or distributors after importation of etiologic agents, hosts, or vectors of human disease.  To carry out this provision, EAIPP has developed two forms for application for a permit.  One form, the ?Application for Permit to Import or Transport Etiologic Agents, hosts, or Vectors of Human Disease? is used to request permits for the importation and subsequent distribution after importation of etiologic agents, hosts, or vectors of human disease.  The second form, the ?Application for Permit to Import or Transport Live Bats? is used to request importation and subsequent distribution after importation of live bats. Issuance of the CDC import permit is essential in protecting the public?s health by monitoring the importation of etiologic agents. 

Etiologic agents are those microorganisms that cause disease in humans and include bacteria, bacterial toxins, viruses, fungi, rickettsia, protozoans, and parasites. These disease-causing microorganisms may also be referred to as infectious agents. Infectious substances and biological materials, such as body fluids and tissues that contain them, are referred to as infectious materials. Organisms such as mosquitoes, ticks, or snails, that may transmit infectious diseases to animals, including humans, are called vectors.

Interested offerors are requested to submit capability statements, including your organization?s technical qualifications to perform this work and your organization?s business size status based on the specified NAICS code ? 541690.  Please submit your response to Kristopher Lemaster, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, via email at Klemaster@cdc.gov by Feb 29, 2008.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Farm Service Agency (FSA) seeks information related to a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Document Imaging System Software for its St. Louis Farm Loan Operations Office (FLOO).  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  FSA intends to assess the capabilities and, if appropriate, issue an RFP at a later date. Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such.  The Government will not pay for, nor reimburse, any expenses incurred in responding to this RFI.

BACKGROUND
Current Capability:

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers and manages farm commodity, credit, conservation, and disaster and loan programs as laid out by Congress through a network of federal, state and county offices. These programs are designed to improve the economic stability of the agricultural industry and to help farmers adjust production to meet demand. Economically, the desired result of these programs is a steady price range for agricultural commodities for both farmers and consumers.

FSA's Farm Loan Program (FLP) delivery is a complex suite of program applications that rely on a business model that is highly decentralized, labor-intensive, and facing technological obsolescence.  Farm Loan Program makes direct and guaranteed farm ownership (FO) and operating loans (OL) to family-size farmers and ranchers who cannot obtain commercial credit from a bank, Farm Credit System institution, or other lender. FSA loans can be used to purchase land, livestock, equipment, feed, seed, and supplies. Loans can also be used to construct buildings or make farm improvements.To meet this need, USDA developed an extensive infrastructure of County-Based Service Centers.  FSA continues to operate with this localized infrastructure despite advances in telecommunications and technology.FSA customers depend on rapid access to FLP benefits to help them weather the challenges of running farming operations.  

Current Process
The St. Louis FLOO receives various types of requests from county based service centers for the success of its programs and operations. This include planning, organizing, directing, and coordinating loan servicing and management reporting activities related to the development, maintenance, and operation of the detail accounting system for Direct and Guaranteed FLP. These requests, normally in the form of documents need to be managed by tracking and assignment. These include facsimile transmission, the United States Postal Service, and via e-mail attachments. The documents are generated from the following sources: reports, forms, and Microsoft Office items (Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint slides, Access databases). These items are often printed and photocopied to meet workflow requirements and to provide an audit trail.  Storage of documents requires paper files and saving electronic files in a shared directory. Retrieval requires an intra-office manual search of files or a search of the shared directory.  Security is maintained by maintaining files and desktop computers in locked offices.

Planned Capability:

The Document Imaging software effort will provide a more viable solution to FLP?s demand for better customer service by enabling capability for workflow and reporting needs.

FSA is seeking information a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS)* software package that will provide document imaging for Farm Loan Program business workflow systems that ensure cost effective and efficient program delivery.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resultant contract administration.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government contracts.  The Government intends to award a cost reimbursement type contract for the effort described herein.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 Research & Development in the Physical Engineering & Life Science. PURPOSE: This study ?Chukchi Sea Offshore Monitoring in Drilling Area (COMIDA):  Chemical and Benthos (CAB).?will constitute a key component of Chukchi Sea environmental studies pertinent to Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 193 which occurred in February, 2008:  http://www.mms.gov/alaska/cproject/Chukchi193/193Saleday/Sale193SaleDayStats.htm.  Specifically, this study will initiate Open water season monitoring of anthropogenic chemicals associated with offshore oil and gas exploration and development and of benthic biota in the area of potential or actual offshore drilling areas of the Chukchi Sea. Sampling will occur in two of the years 2008-2010.    BACKGROUND: In preparation for upcoming lease sales in the Chukchi Sea, Minerals Management Service Alaska OCS Region conducted a three day "Chukchi Offshore Monitoring in Drilling Area (COMIDA) Chukchi Sea" planning workshop November 1-3, 2006, in Anchorage.  The purpose of the workshop was to identify potential monitoring tasks for a COMIDA field effort to meet MMS needs. The workshop report, OCS Study MMS 2007-002 "Proceedings of a Workshop on Chukchi Sea Offshore Monitoring in Drilling Area" was published in April 2007.  The COMIDA workshop described the importance of benthos and chemical monitoring to evaluate the health of the Chukchi ecosystem.  The Government estimates the level of effort for this contract will be four (4) years with two field seasons at $2,312,000 - $2,890,000 in cost.   SCOPE OF WORK: In Task 1, the contractor provides overall project coordination and management role reporting to the MMS contracting officer?s representative (COR).  For Task 2, the Contractor initiates and develops a conceptual food web related to bioaccumulation and risk of trophic transfer of oil industry anthropogenic contaminants.  In Task 3, the Contractor initiates monitoring to distinguish changes in benthic biota and anthropogenic contaminants due to oil and gas activities from those due to changes in climate or food web structure.  This includes providing a research vessel for each of the two sampling years. In Task 4, the Contractor prepares annual CAB report, draft final and revised final report, and technical summary.   For Task 5, the Contractor writes and submits an article describing the research results to a peer-reviewed journal.   HOW TO RESPOND: This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 15.202.

<DESC>1. DESCRIPTION. This notice solicits information regarding commercially available or near commercially available (i.e., full-scale, operational prototype) Spreader Mounted Radiation/Nuclear Detection Technology, and to determine the commercial interest in participating in an evaluation of these technologies led by U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  The primary purpose of the technology is to accurately detect nuclear and radiological materials within containerized cargo as it is being transferred from ship to shore. 

2. SCOPE: The announcement solicits market information and applications for Spreader Mounted Radiation/Nuclear Detection Technology Systems as described above.  CBP is interested in understanding and testing the current state of the art in these systems that are available without the need for further development.  The intent is to obtain a fully functional system to evaluate under limited operational conditions in order to determine readiness for operational deployment.  This RFI seeks information on such products.

3. INFORMATION. CBP?fs evaluation process will consist of a phased approach.  In order to qualify for testing in successive phases, an offeror must satisfactorily complete all testing in the preceding phase.  Test phases include:  
	Phase 1 - Review of Vendor Submittal
	Phase 2 - Limited Operational Testing
	Phase 3 - Follow-on testing at a National Laboratory

Phase 1 is intended to demonstrate to CBP that the proposed technology satisfies the basic functional requirements and is, at a minimum, at a field deployable prototype stage.  The information provided will also be used to further define the tests and conditions for Phases 2 and 3.  At a minimum, vendor submittals shall include:

	Description of the system including technical specifications
	Reports of vendor performed factory, prototype, seaport environmental, quasi-operational and/or independent, tests, demonstrations, and modeling and simulation including system sensitivity
	Safety documentation
	System setup requirements
	Operation procedures including current system response alert/display and data collection capabilities (The Government will need access to the data in near real-time)  
	Assemble/disassemble time

CBP may request further information following an offerors submittal.  All documents are to be provided on company letterhead and provided in MS Word format using Times New Roman font at 12 point.  All packages submitted electronically or by electronic media must be free of any computer virus.  If a virus is found, the package will be destroyed.  Please submit a cover letter that includes the company name and address, with business and technical contact information to include e-mail, fax, telephone, and web page (if applicable).  The cover letter should include a synopsis stating the concept and a brief description of the system.  The cover letter should be limited to no more than two (2) pages.

Phase 2 of the evaluation will consist of a limited field evaluation of the capabilities of Spreader Mounted Radiation/Nuclear Detection Technology Systems.  The evaluations will be conducted by using test objects that will assess the detection capability of the system.  These may include:
	Multiple container sizes
	Multiple container contents
	Multiple configurations of test objects

Evaluation testing will be conducted at a seaport TBD by CBP during the late spring/early summer timeframe.  Responders will be required to ensure safe shipping and handling of all systems to and from the location.  CBP will not bear any cost for shipping and handling nor damage of any systems during this evaluation.  Responders will be limited to one week set up to include any operational checks.

Standardized products will be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor P rogram. <BR><BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the <BR>regi on will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially  minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Region include but are not limited to: Basset Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK 99703; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA 98312-5000; Fairchild AFB Clinic,Fairchild AFB, WA 99011-8701; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK	99702; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK 99506-3620; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA 98431-5000; McChord AFB Clinic, McC hord AFB, WA 98438-1150; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA 98278-8800<BR><BR>This Regional Incentive Agreement announcement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medi cal Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, <BR>or be in process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor (Cardinal Health).  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause  by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization <BR>process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor progr am please access our web site at:  <BR><BR>https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is June 2008.  The eval uation will be based on technical, clinical, and pricing factors.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of th e Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at (253) 968 -0898; Email - patricia.cordier@us.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

The compa ny must also have illuminators and sheaths which are compatible with the above specula sizes.<BR><BR>The Regions estimated annual demand for this product line, based on PV purchases for the previous 12 months is: <BR><BR>Northwest Region: - Total	$90,806.42<BR><BR>The top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR><BR>SPECULA VAGINAL DLXE DISP MED<BR>SPECULA VAGINAL DLXE DISP SML<BR>SHEATH VAGINAL FOR SPECULA<BR>SPECULA VAGINA KLEENSPEC PREM 590 MED<BR>SPECULA VAGINAL WITH SHEATH LRG<BR>SPECULA VAGINAL WITH SHEATH MED<BR>SPECULA VAGINAL WITH SHEATH SML<BR>SPECULA VAGINA KLEENSPEC PREM 590 SRS SM<BR>SHEATH DISP FOR EXAM LIGHT<BR>SPECULA VAGINAL KLEENSPEC  DELUX LRG<BR><BR>Upon request, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, pricing information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses (all email communications between vendors and the region will b e digitally signed) to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and addres s, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to patricia.cordier@us.army.mil Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on 21 March, 2008 the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial sub mission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR>	<BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board for the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians fro m all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Region. They are the decision <BR>makers for this initiative.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best  product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and/or company criteria listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best  tiered-pricing discounts off the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northwest Region. <BR><BR>Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Regions may limit the number of quotes to <BR>the greatest number that will permit efficient competition among vendors. 14 calendar days from the date of th e pricing request will be allowed for responses in the requested format.<BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process: <BR><BR>1.  The sources sought notice will be posted to the FBO for a period of five weeks. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of Close of Business (COB) 4:00PM PST listed on the FBO for responding to the announcement will be disqualified from further consideration. All email communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer. Due to the potential  for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO that its response and litera ture actually arrived at the Region via email. We strongly recommend that each vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission. <BR><BR>2.  At the 3 week mark if indu stry response has been less than anticipated, all vendors with current usage for the product line in the region will be contacted via email. (2 week notice)<BR><BR>3.  Vendors respond to the FBO announcement by e-mail stating their interest in participatin g in the standardization process, addressing the technical/company criteria, and providing product literature to the POC listed on the announcement.<BR><BR>4.  Vendor replies should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company requir ements listed in this announcement. <BR><BR>5.  The TRBO team will compile the technical/company criteria responses and send to the CPT for review.<BR><BR>6.  The CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and which vendors are disqualified based on their responses to the technical/company criteria. Generally, acceptable  responses demonstrate that: <BR>	<BR>		1) The vendor offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of vaginal 	sp ecula.<BR>		2) Based on the vendors responses, the Region has reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services.			3) The vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items.<BR>		4) The vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region.	<BR>		5) The vendor offers discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization  initiative.<BR>		6) The vendors information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)<BR><BR>7.  The vendors who meet the technical/company criteria will be qualified/ invi ted to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via email communication with vendor. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.<BR><BR>Tech nical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted criteria:   <BR>   <BR>1.  Vendor is required to provide vaginal specula, sheaths and illuminators.  Company must have at a mini mum, the following specula sizes: small, medium and large.  Small is defined as having measurements from 6-7 inches long x .75-1.0 inch wide; Medium is 6-7 inches long by 1-1.5 inches wide, and Large is 7.5-8 inches long by 1.25-1.5 inches wide.)  Please n ote that additional products may become required items of supply in the future.  Overall a complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR><BR>2.  Vendors that do not meet the following criteria will be disqualified:<BR>		a. Vendor must have a DAPA for this product group (provide D APA number).<BR>		b. Vendor must have a distribution agreement with Cardinal Health, the regions prime vendor.  Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health.<BR>		c. Vendor must offer committed volume discounts off their DAPA price for this product group. Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offe r a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified.  <BR><BR>3.  Regional Supply Servicing Requirements:  Required elements include a distribution network tha t allows products to reach the Prime Vendor Distribution Center in sufficient quantities to meet the regional demand history in a timely <BR>manner.  In addition, vendors must also have vendor representation sufficient to provide product implementation ser vices and in-servicing to all eight facilities in the region.  Please state your plan for providing the above services.  <BR><BR>4.  Please provide your companys returned goods policy.<BR><BR>5.  Detail any history of backorders and/or recalls for this pr oduct group.  Please include: (a) Dates and duration, (b) Cause, (c) Resolution. . Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have bee n provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these incidents.  If your company has not had any of the above, so state.<BR><BR>6.  Due to the ever increasing number of latex sensitive patients in our health system, our region requires la tex-free <BR><BR>versions of products in this product line.  Please state that your products are latex-free and packaging is clearly labeled as latex free.  <BR><BR>7.  Our region requires vaginal specula products that are optically clear.  Explain how you r companys products meet this requirement.<BR><BR>8.  Specula must have a feature that allows the product to lock in the open position to facilitate ease of completing clinical procedures.  Explain how your companys products meet this requirement.<BR><BR >Phase II Clinical/ Performance Evaluation Process:<BR><BR>1.  Using their clinical expertise, the CPT will develop a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set is based on advances in technology and/ or patient s afety, and on historical usage for the product line.<BR><BR>2.  The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a required delivery date. Each vendor will send the samples directly to the participating MTFs. Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from the standardization process.  Due to the potential for samples to become lost, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO that their samples arriv ed at the designated MTFs. We strongly recommend that vendors confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the deadline, if a problem should occur with the first delivery. <BR><BR>3.  The CPT will evaluate each product against the clinica l/performance criteria. The evaluation will take place in a non-patient care setting, by the clinicians in the CPT.  The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or 'no'; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or 'yes'; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments will be invited and recorded on the evaluations.<BR><BR>4.  If clinicians determine that more information is needed about how the product works in a patient-c are environment, then the vendors who scored highest on the non-patient care evaluation will be evaluated in a patient care setting.  <BR><BR>The Government will include the greatest number of vendors that will permit efficient competition without disrupti ng ongoing patient care. The same clinical/performance criteria and evaluation method will be used in the patient-care setting evaluation.<BR><BR>5.  The CPT has set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1 The CPT will analyze this acceptability a s being at or near 3.1 depending on the break in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the clinical acceptability target threshold of 3.1.  Below this threshold, products will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization. <BR><BR>6.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT members for r eview. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.<BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following <BR><BR>equally weighted criteria:      <BR><BR>1.  The product is free of sharp edges to protect patients from injury.<BR><BR>2.  The speculum locks securely and resists collapsing during use.<BR><BR>3.  The product has features which enhance patient comfort (i.e. can be  warmed, doesnt pinch or bind vaginal tissue during use).<BR><BR>4.  The product is durable and resists cracking/breaking.<BR><BR>5.  The illuminator provides a bright, non-glaring light (to facilitate viewing of tissue during exam.)<BR><BR>6.  The specul um handle has features that provide maneuverability (for easy manipulation of the specula during exam).<BR><BR>7.  The sheath is easy to manipulate before/during/after exam<BR><BR>8.  The product can be assembled and or/disassembled quickly, enhancing prov ider efficiency.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis: <BR><BR>1.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization/ Conversion Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (3) Cons ideration of SKUs (i.e. potential for inventory reduction) by each vendor.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.   <BR><BR>2.  Vendors who meet the clinical acceptability target threshold consider ing the break will be asked to submit pricing for analysis. 14 calendar days from the date of the request will be allowed for responses in the requested format. Vendors that do not meet the deadline and those vendors that fail to respond as required will b e disqualified from consideration. Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO that its response actually arrived at the Region via email. We strong ly recommend that each vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.  Once again, vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion  of the evaluation process. <BR><BR>3.  The TRBO will conduct a price analysis. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or  product lines <BR>requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additional ly, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  <BR><BR>4.  The price analysis will be sent to the Northwest Region TPRB for review. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible (3) three one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<BR><BR>5.  Clinical/Performance evaluation is more important than the price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal among vendors, price becomes more important. <BR><BR>6.  The TPRB reviews the data for acceptable performance and price analysis.<BR><BR>7.  The Designated Senior Logistician (DSL) will ensure that the offered prices in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment will be  a good value considering the costs associated with standardization, operational impact, and regional clinical preferences.<BR><BR>8.  The TPRB selects a vendor or vendors for standardization.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor  can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product <BR>availability.

<SUBJECT>J--Maintaining Lab Equipment
<DESC>This is not an announcement of a solicitation. This is a Request for Information (RFI). The U.S. Geological Survey, National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL), is requesting information regarding service providers capable of servicing and maintaining chromatographic equipment used for environmental analysis.  This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not serve as proposals, bids or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary and shall not constitute a fee to the Government.  The main purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research and determine the organizations capable for future competition.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee participation in future U.S. Geological Survey activities. RFI responses will be accepted in hard copy only.  No electronic responses, such as email or fax, will be accepted.  All proprietary and restricted information provided in response to this synopsis should be clearly marked.  Responses should indicate if the service provider is considered a large or small business.  Please ensure you have included your email address, mailing address, and telephone number in the body of the response.  The information provided should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate that the service provider understands the nature of the work involved, and has the expertise and resources to successfully perform.  All responses are limited to a three to five page narrative on eight and one half by eleven inch paper, using a 12 point font.  All responses shall be in the English language.  Responses must be received no later than 3:00 p.m., Mountain Standard Time, February 27, 2008 to the following address: U.S. Geological Survey Acquisition and Grants Branch, MS204 Attn:  Gayle Niles Building 53, Room H1122 Denver Federal Center, 6th and Kipling Denver, CO 80225 RFI OVERVIEW The USGS National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL http://nwql.usgs.gov/ ) provides environmental analytical services, specializing in trace- and ultratrace-level analyses of water, sediment, tissue and other matrices.  The NWQL is seeking a service provider to service and maintain the analytical equipment used to conduct these analyses.  The equipment is primarily manufactured by Agilent, but also includes related equipment used for volatile organic analyses produced by other manufacturers (purge-and-trap concentrators, autosamplers, etc.).  Perkin-Elmer gas-chromatographic equipment is also included.   Although the NWQL has procedures for purchasing new equipment to replace older and outdated equipment on a cyclic basis,  some older equipment is still in use, and must still be supported. All equipment must be serviced and maintained in a manner that will minimize downtime because of the large amount of samples analyzed at the laboratory.  This RFI will be used to survey the marketplace, identify potential innovative approaches, and gather additional requirements for a Request for Proposals (RFP) that USGS expects to issue in the near future. SUPPORTED EQUIPMENT LIST The following list enumerates the various components and models of equipment to be supported by the service provider.

<SUBJECT>Q -- TRICARE Claim Audit Review Services
<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH FOR TRICARE CLAIMS AUDIT REVIEW SERVICES (TCARS)

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR COMMENTS ON A DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK AS PART OF MARKET RESEARCH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION, PART 10, FOR A POSSIBLE FUTURE TRICARE CONTRACT AS A FOLLOW-ON TO THE CURRENT CLAIMS AUDIT REVIEW SERVICES CONTRACT.   

The Department of Defense (DoD), TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is developing the requirement for providing an independent, impartial audit of reimbursement determinations and claims processing services.  As part of its market research, the Government is seeking industry input with regards to its draft Statement of Work (SOW) which is found under TRICARE Claims Audit Review Services (TCARS), Reference Number H94002-08-R-0003 on the TRICARE Website at http://www.tricare.mil/contracting/healthcare/solicitations.   DoD does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the survey submitted in response to the market analysis nor pay for costs associated with responses received.

Comments are solicited as to whether the language included in the draft SOW is sufficiently descriptive/detailed and broad enough in scope, includes applicable and necessary standard industry/commercial practices, and establishes reasonable objectives and obtainable standards that can be measured and used in conjunction with possible performance incentives. Comments/suggestions on additional aspects of the draft SOW are encouraged and may also be submitted. All comments/suggestions made should be stated in generic/broad and nonproprietary terms.  A summary of the Government s needs are basically as follows:  The contractor will evaluate the processing procedures, reimbursement methodologies, and payment record coding procedures utilized by the TNEX Managed Care Support (MSC), the T-3 MCS, the TRICARE Dual Eligible Fiscal Intermediary Contract (TDEFIC), TRICARE Pharmacy (TPHARM), TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP), and TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program (ADDP) contractors, to determine contractor compliance with TRICARE directives.  Information received in response to the SOW part of this market survey will not be considered confidential and may be incorporated to applicable portions of the SOW during the formal Request For Proposal (RFP).  Comments relative to the SOW must be submitted to TMA through the TMA website using the, Question and Answer,  link.  Your comments will be considered whenever received; however we request your comments as soon as possible.  Interested parties may submit a response by e-mail through the aforementioned TMA Website no later than February 27, 2008.

Please note that the SOW will make references to Sections J and F which are not available at this time.  Special Notices will be issued through the FBO when these Sections become available and an appropriate extension to the response date will be identified.   Questions relative to an interested party s capabilities are in process of being generated and will also be posted to the TMA website.  A Special Notice will be posted through the FBO advising of this and providing adequate time for interested parties to respond to the questions.  An interested party s responses to these questions will be held in confidence and will be made available only to the Government s reviewers.  These responses must be forwarded through the TMA website using the link referenced, E-mail Questions to the Contracting Officer.

The government will not be publishing or responding in a public forum to any comments or questions as part of this market research.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. 

It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued on or about May 30, 2008.  The RFP will be accessible in the solicitation posting, also on the TMA website.  The date of receipt of proposals is anticipated to be June 27, 2008.  The Government will choose the proposal that is most advantageous with consideration given to technical factors, performance history (inclusive of three references having received similar services) and price data.   FOB Destination shall be Aurora, CO, 80011.  The contract action will result in a Firm Fixed Price contract.

<SUBJECT>99 -- HPC Technology Insertion  2009 (TI-09) RFQ and NOTICE OF PRE-SOLICITAITON BRIEFING
<DESC>The General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Service (GSA-FAS), on behalf of the Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP), is issuing this notice to inform industry that an initial Request For Quotation (Phase I), for the Technology Insertion FY09 (TI-09) will be issued on or about April 21, 2008.  Phase I of the RFQ will be issued primarily to determine general pricing, performance (via a set of DoD Benchmarks) and related high performance computing (HPC) functional capabilities for HPC systems that can be delivered on or before July 2009.  

The application benchmark codes that are anticipated to be included in the TI-09 application benchmark suite are recognized by the following names: CTH, HYCOM, GAMESS, OOCORE, AMR and LAMMPS.  It is estimated that a system with approximately 1024 cores will be required to execute the benchmarks.  Note that all benchmark times submitted in response to the RFQ are considered guaranteed benchmark times that will be verified at time of system acceptance.  Phase II of the RFQ will request offerors to provided detailed pricing, configuration, performance (via a set of DoD Benchmarks), maintenance, and delivery information for one or more specific HPC system configurations to significantly improve the DoD?s HPC capability and capacity.  Issuance of a final RFQ (Phase II) is anticipated on or about September 5, 2008 and contract awards are anticipated in late December of 2008.

The HPCMP and GSA have conducted annual Technology Insertions since 2001 and have learned that the assembly and delivery of large (TI-08 awards consisted of several systems exceeding 10,000 cores each) production ready HPC systems between December and the following July is challenging.  It has been determined that an important element for success includes contractual relationships directly between the Government and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of HPC class systems.   As a result, responses to the RFQ will only be considered from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who:  (1) have offerings obtainable via existing GSA Contracts under Schedule 70 ?General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, Services?; (2)  have demonstrated the sustainment of a commercially available HPC system?s product line with success in large scale manufacturing, deployment and maintenance of commercially available, production HPC systems; and (3) have clearances allowing access to sensitive DoD technology and facilities.  Furthermore, the Government financial appropriation associated with this acquisition does not permit the purchase of any supercomputer which is not manufactured in the United States.  Additionally, note that the resulting contract(s) will contain consideration clauses citing four (4) percent of the purchase price per month for late delivery and the right to reject the system.  

Interested vendors are required to submit a NTE 10 page paper providing evidence of their ability to meet the above requirements to Ms. Deborah Joeckel at deborah.joeckel@gsa.gov with a copy to Mr. Eddie Mills at eddie.mills@gsa.gov by COB March 21, 2008. 

In cases where the OEM is acquiring substantial portions of a potentially offered system from third party suppliers, please be specific in justifying your role as an OEM with a sustainable HPC product line versus, for example; a reseller, an assembler or an integrator of HPC systems.  An evaluation of the information submitted will be conducted and letters of eligibility will be distributed to qualified vendors by April 11, 2008.  

An information briefing will be offered to pre-qualified vendors.  The briefing is currently scheduled for the morning of April 29, 2008 beginning at 9:00AM EDT and will be followed by vendor-specific, one-on-one information exchange meetings and question and answer sessions individually scheduled for the afternoon of April 29 and, as needed, on April 30 to host all qualified vendors.  Each vendor will be allowed 30 minutes for their April 29 or April 30 one-on-one session.   For more details about the HPCM Program visit the website at www.hpcmo.hpc.mil.  Examples of previous TI-XX RFQs can be found under ?Community? then ?Technology Insertion? in the left hand window of the HPCMP homepage.  Note the requirement to use the left hand window?s vertical scroll bar to find ?Community?.  Questions can be submitted to GSA at any time during the RFQ process.

All correspondence, questions and answers, amendments etc will be issued/posted on the web at www.fbo.gov. 5.  A tour of the protoypical project areas at the Providence VAMC was conducted with the attendees after the conference. A site visit for the Audiology Renovation at the New Bedford location would be posted at a later time. The following Questions and answers were provided: 6.  What is the CAT II Prototypical Project?      The Street Light Wiring Project is a CAT II Specialty Trade (Electrical)    7.  If not a Specialty Trade, how do you get to pursue CAT II Projects?      Just check off the CAT II Box. 8.  If you are not a Specialty Trade, can you participate through joint ventures?      Yes, but must review the Public Law on Joint Ventures and review Section A.1 and A.2 of the RFP. 9.  Do you follow the same regulations as Department of Defense?      The Department of Veteran's Affairs follows the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the VAAR 10.  What are the Task Order Values; are the catogories limited or just each Task Order in the categories?         The Minimum Task Order Amount is $2,000 and the Maximum Task Order amount is $5,000,000.  The Cumulative amount any one contractor can receive is $15,000,000. 11.  How many MATOC's will the Dept of Veteranýýýs Affairs award?         The government anticipates award of a minimum of 12 individual MATOC contracts, providing sufficient qualified contractors present offers. 12.  What if you (The dept of Veteran's Affairs) donýýýt reach the minimum?         Provided we receive sufficient response; see response to Question 11. 13.   CAT III states that it is a VOSB set aside and there is no preference to SDVOSB. Does that mean there will be only awards to VOSB?          No; only that no preference is given to SDVOSB over VOSB under CAT III. But, SDVOSB's are encouraged to submit proposals for the CAT III prototypical project if interested. 14.  The fact that you are selected [receive an award] for a category, does not guarantee you work?        No. You still must compete for Task Orders under that category and type of project (e.g. General Construction or Specialty trade and applicable category). 15.  In the technical proposal portion, if you include the three required plans, does that favor you in evaluation?        Reference Exhibit D which states ýýýA full Infection Control Plan will be required if you are awarded a contract and is NOT required with the proposal.  If you do provide a plan, indicate if it is a draft for this contract, a sample from another project or a corporate plan.ýýý 16. Does Past Performance have to be relative to the Agency [Dept of Veteranýýýs Affairs] or in general?       Past Performance can be any relevant Past Performance information from any relevant project from any agency, not just the Dept of Veteranýýýs Affairs. 17.  A general question was posed to the attendees asking if they understood the MATOC process. There were no negative responses. 18.  A clarification was provided that the maximum award amount, cumulative over the base period and option years, is $15,000,000 per MATOC Awardee. 19.  If an offeror has a GSA Contract, must he submit GSA prices?        No. The GSA contract is separate from this MATOC. 20.  Is there any forecast of potential solicitations?        The VISN does forecast and post projected projects.  It is VISN 1 ýýýwide therefore offerors looking for projects for the Providence VAMC must look for the Providence specific projects. The website will be posted at a later date. 21.  Is this is prototypical project for VISN 1? Will other offices of VISN 1 use this process?        This is a new endeavor here at the Providence VAMC.  We hope other VISN 1 offices will eventually follow this process. 22.  Will there be a mandatory CAC card program?        No, not as of today. 23.  When will the site visit be scheduled for the New Bedford Audiology Renovation Project?        The site visit will be posted at a later date. 24. A Joint Venture Agreement Template handout was provided to all attendees as requested. 25.  The pre-proposal conference and site visit concluded at 2:00 pm

<SUBJECT>66--Notice of Intent to Sole SourceBiometric Custom Data Acquisition Systemsfor Tendon Transfer Surgery Study
<DESC>This is a notice that the Department of Veterans Affairs intends to negotiate, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, a sole source purchase order with Biometrics LTD, PO Box 340, Ladysmith,VA, for the purchase of five custom data acquisition systems.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 12 -Acquisition for Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   This procurement is being conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The VA Palo Alto has a requirement for five custom data acquisition systems in support of a Multi-Center trial that includes six other facilities to study tendon transfer surgeries using the protocol developed by the VA Palo Alto.  This project was designed to duplicate a testing protocol used at the VAPAHCS.   Custom supports and grips were developed and fabricated for the upper limb surgery in tetraplegia conference last September; these items cannot interface with any other brand of equipment.  In order for participating centers to obtain consistent measurements that can be combined for analysis, it is critical that identical measurement systems be used to take postoperative measurements.    This Notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability by submitting literature and documentation, detailing the equipment capabilities, to the Contracting Officer via email to jeanne.woodcock@va.gov or fax at 916-923-4554.

This will be a thermostat and time clock combination, which will run the circulating pumps continuously during the day, and will control the circulating pumps in accordance with space temperature at night.  During the night cycle, the pumps will run only on a call for heat.  Starting the pumps will start the boilers.  Since the day thermostats are set at a higher level than the night thermostats, all the unit heater fans will come on, until the night thermostat is satisfied.
The boilers will be controlled by the circulating pump motor starters, and will fire when the circulating pumps have been started.  During the day, the circulating pumps will run continuously.  At night, the pumps will be under control of the night thermostat, and will run as needed to supply night heat.  The boiler firing rate will be under control of the boiler outdoor reset control, and will be varied as needed to maintain the supply water temperature scheduled in accordance with outdoor temperature.

e.  Customers also require the ability to set up alerts and run these alerts repeatedly across research areas
f.  Customers also require the ability to display related articles, i.e. to pull up other articles related to their area of research when they retrieve their original search results.


            
3.0  Description of Work

3.1  
Ideally, the FDA Biosciences Library prefers to search across one platform rather than multiple platforms.  This method provides a more efficient manner for FDA researchers by saving of overall search time necessary for finding necessary information and performing the research work necessary to meet the mission of FDA.  

The contractor is expected to troubleshoot access as needed, but it will not be necessary to respond during non-operational hours as defined above.

	
3.2  Deliverables:

If a plug-in, additional software or recommended software is required for optimal use, please include specific requirements. Contractor will address any questions or problems encountered when using this product with supported software or hardware.
The contractor shall provide usage statistics on a monthly basis.  The format of the usage statistics is provided either via email or contractor provided login and should include session count, search count and total document retrievals per title.


Contractor shall provide online tutorials.  Contractor shall also provide on-site training, briefings and updates to FDA researchers, in the DC area as well as selected remote offices.

4.  Period of Performance
Contract will commence on the date the contractor receives notification of award from the Office of Acquisitions and Grants. Contract will run for 12 months (1 year).


5.  Payment



Payment will be made only after satisfactory completion of concrete deliverables/service (i.e. access is available agency-wide via a static URL - IP access). 
Payment for the deliverables/services will occur only after and in the following order:
a.  a purchase order has been generated by the FDA contracting office.  The contractor shall NOT provide service to the FDA until a purchase order has been received.  This is considered an illegal procurement by the government.
b.  the FDA is being provided access to the resource 
5.  Deliverables

5.1 	Products to be delivered via email or mail
5.2	Static URL, password information, product training, technical support numbers, account number, promotional materials, monthly usage statistics


6.  Place of Delivery or Performance
 
6.1  The products provided shall be hosted by the contractor server, but will be available via the Library?s intranet page, agency-wide.


7.0  Section 508

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

Subpart B -- Technical Standards
? 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.
(a) A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content). 
(b) Equivalent alternatives for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized with the presentation. 
(c) Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup. 
(d) Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet. 
(e) Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map. 
(f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape. 
(g) Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. 
(h) Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers. 
(i) Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation. 
(j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz. 
(k) A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, shall be provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of this part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes. 
(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology. 
(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with ?1194.21(a) through (l). 
(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues. 
(o) A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. 
(p) When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required. 
Note to ?1194.22:
1. The Board interprets paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section as consistent with the following priority 1 Checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) (May 5, 1999) published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium: 

Section 1194.22 Paragraph	WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint
(a)	1.1
(b)	1.4
(c)	2.1
(d)	6.1
(e)	1.2
(f)	9.1
(g)	5.1
(h)	5.2
(i)	12.1
(j)	7.1
(k)	11.4


2. Paragraphs (l), (m), (n), (o), and (p) of this section are different from WCAG 1.0. Web pages that conform to WCAG 1.0, level A (i.e., all priority 1 checkpoints) must also meet paragraphs (l), (m), (n), (o), and (p) of this section to comply with this section. WCAG 1.0 is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505. 
Subpart D -- Information, Documentation, and Support
? 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support.
(a) Product support documentation provided to end-users shall be made available in alternate formats upon request, at no additional charge. 
(b) End-users shall have access to a description of the accessibility and compatibility features of products in alternate formats or alternate methods upon request, at no additional charge. 
(c) Support services for products shall accommodate the communication needs of end-users with disabilities.

<DESC>This announcement is a re-post of ED-FSA-01-25-2008. 

The Two-Factor Authentication project to expand the Department of Education Federal Student Aid (FSA) Security Architecture (SA) will be evaluating and selecting a tool to incorporate into the SA environment.  The goal of the project is to select a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution that allows FSA to quickly and efficiently deploy Two-Factor authentication for multiple applications.  Also, the Two-Factor solution will be used only for Internet/Intranet enabled applications.  Client to server or mainframe applications will not be considered.

The product selected will be the enterprise standard for implementing Two-Factor authentication.  In FSA's mixture of legacy and target state vision (TSV) applications, a future component of the solution will be the ability to integrate with applications via web service enabled technologies or the equivalent.  

To receive the attachment detailing the requirements, email robert.st.germain@ed.gov and bill.levenson@ed.gov .

Response Dates: Questions due by 5:00 p.m. on 02/20/08 to the Contracting Officer, Bob St. Germain, via email at robert.st.germain@ed.gov and to Bill Levenson, Contracts Specialist, bill.levenson@ed.gov . Quotes are due to the same contacts via email by 5:00 p.m. on 02/25/08.

<DESC>The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract for the purchase of repairs to the vehicle exhaust system equipment at the fire department. The government anticipates a sole source award to Alpha Industrial Supply.  Our justification: "Alpha Industrial Supply provided the existing system. Repairs are needed and necessary as this is a safety inspection checklist item. Replacing the existing system would not be cost effective to the government. Therefore, it is in the best interest for the government to repair this current system rather than replace, saving thousands of dollars. This is the only company that can work on this specific system as it's proprietary and we need to ensure that it's actually working when they are finished. We are not aware of any other resources on the market that meet our needs in terms of quality and respiratory protection issues.  It is important to maintain continuity of health and safety."

Statement of Work

1.0  Scope and Purpose

1.1	The FDA Biosciences Library requires hardcopy and unlimited online web access, via IP with staff registration, to a core set of regulatory newsletters and a drug tracking and analysis tool published by FDC Reports of Elsevier Publishing (preferably through the robust search engine provided with the resource).  Purchase of these newsletters directly through the publisher avoids royalty fees incurred if purchased through an aggregator.  The online platform must allow quick searches across all resources simultaneously in one search statement with 18 month full-text access to articles of interest.  Access is 24/7 for Agency staff with print copies directed to the Library and selected centers.  As FDA researchers require access to the most current editions of the newsletter, FDA staff must be able to register for email update access and will receive each issue via email based on the respective publishing schedule of the newsletter title.
1.2	The drug tracking and analysis tool should include at least 9,000 drug records and companies covered with chemical structures and properties. Late-phase preclinical development through launch and post marketing studies should be included with the capability to review the latest news from external sources - monitor licensing, merger and acquisition activities along with obtaining information on companies, key contacts and annual reports when available. Personalize usage by creating a "Personal Profile" to track items of interest

2.0	Specific Requirements

2.1  The FDA requires online access to the following publications, with full-text back access for 18 months, searchable across one platform and one interface.  

"The Gold Sheet" - Quality Control Reports (monthly report)
"The Gray Sheet" - Medical Devices, Diagnostics & Instrumentation (weekly report)
"The Pink Sheet" - Prescription Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology (weekly report)
?The Pink Sheet DAILY? - Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology (daily)
"The Rose Sheet" - Toiletries, Fragrances & Skin Care (weekly report)
"The Tan Sheet" - Nonprescription Pharmaceuticals & Nutritionals (weekly report)
?Health News Daily?  (daily report)
?The Silver Sheet? - Medical Device Quality Systems & Regulatory Compliance (weekly report)
?Pharmaceutical Approvals Monthy?  (monthly report)

Intelios - Drug Tracking+Analysis tool with the ability to establish a personal profile and alert. 

2.2 	For the above list of publications, the contractor shall provide the following:

a.  A site license for 24/7 desktop web access, via IP/password, for the Agency
b.  Customer service shall be available to troubleshoot website/connectivity/password issues via phone, email, etc.
c.  Researchers and librarians need access to all of the resources and must be able to search selected resources with one query and across one interface and platform.
d.  Customers require a single access interface to search across multiple resources in order to save research time.  This type of simultaneous searching reduces the need for multiple searches and saves the agency researchers research time and the cost of purchasing multiple print subscriptions through various contractors. 
e. hard copies must be tied to this license to provide paper copies to researchers who require paper as well as electronic access;  Webprint (which allows users to print, and cut and paste articles into email) must be included as well.  
            

3.0  Description of Work

3.1  
Ideally, the FDA Biosciences Library prefers to search across one platform rather than multiple platforms.  This method provides a more efficient manner for FDA researchers by saving of overall research and search time necessary for finding necessary information and performing the research work in a timely manner in order to meet review deadlines  necessary to meet the mission of FDA.  

The contractor is expected to troubleshoot access as needed, but it will not be necessary to respond during non-operational hours as defined above.

	
3.2  Deliverables:

If a plug-in, additional software or recommended software is required for optimal use, please include specific requirements. Contractor will address any questions or problems encountered when using this product with supported software or hardware.
The contractor shall provide usage statistics on a monthly basis.  The format of the usage statistics is provided either via email or contractor provided login and should include session count per title.

Contractor shall provide online tutorials or Help or FAQ?s to assist customers with access.  Contractor shall also provide on-site training, briefings and updates to FDA researchers, in the DC area as well as selected remote offices upon request. 

4.  Period of Performance

Payment for the deliverables/services will occur only after and in the following order:
a.  a purchase order has been generated by the FDA contracting office.  The contractor shall NOT provide service to the FDA until a purchase order has been received.  This is considered an illegal procurement by the government.

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

Subpart B -- Technical Standards
? 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.

(c) Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup. 
(d) Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet. 
(e) Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map. 
(f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape. 
(g) Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. 
(h) Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers. 
(i) Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation. 
(j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz. 
(k) A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, shall be provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of this part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes. 
(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology. 
(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with ?1194.21(a) through (l). 
(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues. 
(o) A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. 
(p) When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required. 
Note to ?1194.22:
1. The Board interprets paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section as consistent with the following priority 1 Checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) (May 5, 1999) published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium:

(f)	9.1
(g)	5.1
(h)	5.2
(i)	12.1
(j)	7.1
(k)	11.4


2. Paragraphs (l), (m), (n), (o), and (p) of this section are different from WCAG 1.0. Web pages that conform to WCAG 1.0, level A (i.e., all priority 1 checkpoints) must also meet paragraphs (l), (m), (n), (o), and (p) of this section to comply with this section. WCAG 1.0 is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505. 
Subpart D -- Information, Documentation, and Support
? 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support.
(a) Product support documentation provided to end-users shall be made available in alternate formats upon request, at no additional charge. 
(b) End-users shall have access to a description of the accessibility and compatibility features of products in alternate formats or alternate methods upon request, at no additional charge.

Statement of Work

1.0  Scope and Purpose

1.1  The FDA Biosciences Library requires online web access, via IP, to a cross-searchable database for 6 to 10 concurrent users. The online platform must allow quick searches across all resources simultaneously in one search statement.  Access is 24/7 for Agency staff and reduces the need for multiple individual copies of expensive resources. 

2.0	Specific Requirements

2.1  The FDA requires online access to a product that shall provide, via one interface and one search platform access to the following titles:

?	TOMES Plus System, REPRORISK System, DrugDex, Index Nominum, AltMedDex, RPS HerbalMedicine, CenterWatch Drug Intelligence, and DiseaseDex Emergency Medicine, DrugReax, Index Nominum, Martindales Complete Drug Reference, Hazardous Substance Databank (HSDB), Shephard?s Catalog of Teratogenic Agents, Teratogen Information System (TERIS), Registry of Toxic Effects (RTECS), POISONINDEX System,  and unlimited site license access to the Physician?s Desk Reference (PDR).   Databases provide drug information, dosing and therapeutic tools and drug identification relevant to FDA staff.
?	patient management and treatment protocols (including drugs, plants, household products)
?	medication dosage calculators, tablet/capsule identification and emergency treatment
?	complementary and alternative medicine
?	an international directory providing formulas, synonyms and therapeutic courses of drugs and drug derivatives
?	daily RSS news feeds
?	online, comprehensive reference resource that is able to offer specialty focused clinical resources including, multi-drug interaction checker and evidence-based application for PDA devices

2.2 	For the above list, the contractor shall provide the following:

a.  A site license for 24/7 desktop web access, via IP, for the Agency
b.  Customer service shall be available to troubleshoot website/connectivity issues via phone, email, etc.
c.  Researchers and librarians need access to all of the resources and must be able to search selected resources with one query and one interface.
d.  Customers require a single access interface to search across multiple resources.  This type of simultaneous searching reduces the need for multiple searches and saves the agency researcher?s research time and the cost of purchasing multiple print subscriptions through various contractors. 
e.  Customers also require the ability to set up alerts and run these alerts repeatedly across research areas
f.  Customers also require the ability to display related articles, i.e. to pull up other articles related to their area of research when they retrieve their original search results.

            
3.0  Description of Work

3.1  
Ideally, the FDA Biosciences Library prefers to search across one platform rather than multiple platforms.  This method provides a more efficient, time and cost savings manner for FDA researchers by saving of overall search time necessary for finding necessary information and performing the research work necessary to meet the mission of FDA.  

The contractor is expected to troubleshoot access as needed, but it will not be necessary to respond during non-operational hours as defined above.

	
3.2  Deliverables:

3.2.1 Ideally the FDA Biosciences Library prefers to search across one platform rather than multiple platforms in order to meet the needs of FDA researchers and save the Agency researchers search time in order for researchers to perform the work in a timely manner to meet the mission of FDA. 

If a plug-in, additional software or recommended software is required for optimal use, please include specific requirements. Contractor will address any questions or problems encountered when using this product with supported software or hardware.
The contractor shall provide usage statistics on a monthly basis.  The format of the usage statistics is provided either via email or contractor provided login and should include session count, search count and total document retrievals per title.

Contractor shall provide online tutorials.  Contractor shall also provide on-site training, briefings and updates to FDA researchers, in the DC area as well as selected remote offices.

4.  Period of Performance
Contract will be for 12 months (1 year).


5.  Payment

Payment will be made only after satisfactory completion of concrete deliverables/service (i.e. access is available agency-wide via a static URL - IP access). 

Payment for the deliverables/services will occur only after and in the following order:
a.  a purchase order has been generated by the FDA contracting office.  The contractor shall NOT provide service to the FDA until a purchase order has been received.  This is considered an illegal procurement by the government.
b.  the FDA is being provided access to the resource 


5.  Deliverables

5.1 	Products to be delivered via email or mail
5.2	Static URL, password information (if necessary), product training, technical support numbers, account number, promotional materials, monthly usage statistics


6.  Place of Delivery or Performance
 
6.1  The products provided shall be hosted by the contractor server, but will be available via the Library?s intranet page, agency-wide.


7.0  Section 508

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

Subpart B -- Technical Standards
? 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.
(a) A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content). 
(b) Equivalent alternatives for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized with the presentation. 
(c) Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup. 
(d) Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet. 
(e) Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map. 
(f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape. 
(g) Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. 
(h) Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers. 
(i) Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation. 
(j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz. 
(k) A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, shall be provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of this part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes. 
(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology. 
(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with ?1194.21(a) through (l). 
(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues. 
(o) A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. 
(p) When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required. 
Note to ?1194.22:
1. The Board interprets paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section as consistent with the following priority 1 Checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) (May 5, 1999) published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium: 

Section 1194.22 Paragraph	WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint
(a)	1.1
(b)	1.4
(c)	2.1
(d)	6.1
(e)	1.2
(f)	9.1
(g)	5.1
(h)	5.2
(i)	12.1
(j)	7.1
(k)	11.4


2. Paragraphs (l), (m), (n), (o), and (p) of this section are different from WCAG 1.0. Web pages that conform to WCAG 1.0, level A (i.e., all priority 1 checkpoints) must also meet paragraphs (l), (m), (n), (o), and (p) of this section to comply with this section. WCAG 1.0 is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505. 
Subpart D -- Information, Documentation, and Support
? 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support.
(a) Product support documentation provided to end-users shall be made available in alternate formats upon request, at no additional charge. 
(b) End-users shall have access to a description of the accessibility and compatibility features of products in alternate formats or alternate methods upon request, at no additional charge. 
(c) Support services for products shall accommodate the communication needs of end-users with disabilities.

<SOLNBR>H94002-08-Q-0006
<RESPDATE>022608

<DESC>This posting is to inform about the Sole Source renewal of annual maintenance and support services on the CT Summation Enterprise for 40 users as a 12 month base period with two 12 month options.   

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will be issued as request for quotation number H94002-08-Q-0006.  

This is a sole source requirement in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1); the TRICARE Management Activity intends to award a firm fixed-price purchase order as a 12 month base period with two 12 month options to CT Corp DBA Summation Legal, 111 8th Avenue 13th Floor, New York, NY 10011-5201, in accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13.  

Sole Source Justification: Description of Services - One of the prime missions of the TRICARE Management Activity Office of General Counsel is to represent the agency before various courts, boards, and other forums.  In order to effectively represent the agency it is imperative that the Office of General Counsel have access to an Automated Litigation Support (ALS) service which allows agency attorneys to search transcripts, litigation documents, electronic evidence, etc. electronically after the data has been imputed into the Summation system.  Currently, the Office of General Counsel is using DITSCAP/DIACAP approved Summation software.  The purpose of this purchase is for maintenance of that software.  Authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition - To compete and acquire new software, the cost associated in maintaining, installing, training users, and obtaining DIACAP approval on the software will more than duplicate costs in which the government will not recover.  In addition, due to the time sensitivity associated with multiple litigation/bid protest cases, the user agency will experience a substantial delay transitioning to new software on stand alone workstations from at least two, separate locations, while awaiting a prolonged DIACAP certification for the software to be approved on a stand-alone network and for the TMA network.  It is in the government?s best economical interest to solicit as a sole source for the maintenance and support renewal.   The DIACAP certified existing software is the only source that can meet the agency?s needs within the required time frame.  It is the Contracting Officer?s determination that the anticipated price to the government for maintenance and support renewal will be fair and reasonable through the application of price analysis between the price of the sole source maintenance and support renewal and the price associated in comparison with new software with its associated maintenance and training costs.  Market Research - Market research was conducted by attempting to obtain pricing information from at least four additional publishers of litigation support software and maintenance.  In comparing the renewal price for the maintenance and support for the CT Summation Enterprise software and the cost associated with acquiring other products, there will be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that will not be recovered through competition.  Demonstration of the Contractor?s Unique Qualifications - CT Summation Enterprise is the proprietary product of CT Summation.  CT Summation is the sole provider of the software and its maintenance and support.  In addition, the CT Summation Enterprise software became DIACAP certified and was installed on the TMA network in December 2007 when the process began in August 2006, sixteen months total.

The NAICS Code is 541199 ? All other legal services with a business size standard of $6,500,000.00; although this requirement is not a small-business set-aside.

DLAD 52.233-9000 Agency Protests (Sep 1999)
Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity?s Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the contracting officer.
DLAD 52.233-9001 Disputes: Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)    (Jun 2001)
(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. 
(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. 
(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.
Request for Quotation (RFQ) due date and time is February 28, 2008 @ 2:00PM local time.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, during the term of this contract, the Contractor shall post a notice, in the form of a poster, informing employees of their rights concerning union membership and payment of union dues and fees, in conspicuous places in and about all its plants and

offices, including all places where notices to employees are customarily posted.

Notice to Employees 
Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs. Under certain conditions, the law permits a union and an employer to enter into a union-security agreement requiring employees to pay uniform periodic dues and initiation fees. However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. 
If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments. 
For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its Regional offices or at the following address or toll free number:

(c) The Contractor shall comply with all provisions of Executive Order 13201 of February 17, 2001, and related implementing regulations at 29 CFR Part 470, and orders of the Secretary of Labor. 
(d) In the event that the Contractor does not comply with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), or (g), the Secretary may direct that this contract be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and declare the Contractor ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures at 29 CFR Part 470, Subpart B?Compliance Evaluations, Complaint Investigations and Enforcement Procedures. Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided by 29 CFR Part 470, which implements Executive Order 13201, or as are otherwise provided by law. 
(e) The requirement to post the employee notice in paragraph (b) does not apply to?

(3) Reproduce and use exact duplicate copies of the Department of Labor?s official poster. 
    (g) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, entered into in connection with this contract, unless exempted by the Department of Labor Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Programs on account of special circumstances in the national interest under authority of 29 CFR 470.3(c). For indefinite quantity subcontracts, the Contractor shall include the substance of this clause if the value of orders in any calendar year of the subcontract is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

If the Contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor or vendor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the Contractor may request the United States, through the Secretary of Labor, to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States. 

 It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN:  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract


number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

 Fax:  (202) 475-3904

             Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be submitted via email no later than 28 February 2008 by 11:00 A.M, and be directed to: Jay McReynolds at e-mail jay.s.mcreynolds@uscg.mil, telephone (510) 637-5975, with a copy to Valerie Rivera-Chase, at e-mail:  valerie.s.riverachase@uscg.mil, or by telephone (510) 637-5972.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post a second set of Questions and Answers pertaining to this requirement.

February 15, 2008
Second set of Questions and Answers to Solicitation number M00146-08-T-N044

Q1. With respect to providing a compact, portable vacuum that can fit well within the 30-inch width constraint outlined in your last response, can the Government accept our standard 23-gallo drawer mounted drum (drum slides out from beneath the vacuum head), rather than limiting the volume to the 16-gallon spec? In either case, the limit of 1# of aluminum dust accumulation will result in drum removal prior to its filling.

Answer: No.  As stated in paragraph 2.ee. of the Essential Characteristics the vacuum dust storage bin capacity shall be no less than 3 gallons and no greater than 16 gallons.

Q2: We offer an optional drum level detection system that can be indicate either drum weight or drum fill level. Does the Government have any interest in an integrated drum level detection system?

Answer: No.

Q3: We offer our units will mutliple ports to support the simultaneous operation of multiple hoses of various lengths. Our standard flow rates are 70% greater than the minimum flow rates specified at the various vacuum levels to support this feature. And our standard filter area is 200% times the minimum 80SF specified. As a consequence, maximum hose lengths exceed those set forth in the manifold descriptors (e.g., Section 2.3 of the specification) by very wide margins (at least 200 ft.). 

Our question is this: Can the government accept deployment of a portable HEPA vacuum system capable of simultaneous supporting up to 6 hoses of various lengths up to 200 ft. as an alternative to the hard-tubed, segmented vacuum manifold and hose combinations described in the specification?

Answer: No.
