<p>The Western Acquisition Division (WAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Seattle, WA is posting this Request for Information on behalf of the National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS), Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC).</p>
<p>This request is issued for the purpose of exchanging information to improve the Government's understanding of industry capabilities. The RFI will enable potential offerors to determine whether, or how, they could satisfy the Government's requirements to provide supplies and services at reasonable price.</p>
<p>For purposes of determine Small Business size standard, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement 541715.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:  The Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides scientific and technical support to NOAA Fisheries for the management, conservation, and wise use of the northwest region's marine and anadromous resources.  The Marine Mammal and Seabird Ecology Team is responsible for research on the ecology, distribution, abundance, and threats to marine mammal and seabird species in the NW, primarily endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales.</p>
<p>For over 10 years, the Whale Museum, the incumbent contractor, has maintained long-term data sets on the location of killer whales, primarily in the inland waters of Washington and southern British Columbia and information about the number and types of vessels in close proximity to the whales. Whale location data enables assessment of intra- and inter-annual movement and habitat use patterns.     The Museum's Soundwatch Boater Education Program conducts on-water boater education, and collects, compiles and analyzes data, and prepares reports on vessel activities around killer whales.  Vessel data assists with management of endangered Southern Resident killer whales including evaluation of the number and types of vessels that are potentially affected by whale watching guidelines within the Haro Strait Region of Washington State and Southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and the impacts of vessel activities on the recovery of the Southern Residents.</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE:  The Government is determining whether there are other additional sources that are capable of performing the same functions as the incumbent contractor.  The Government is looking for a vendor that can perform all of the following  tasks:  (1 ) collect, compile and archive all sighting data of killer whales, particularly Southern Residents, from all available data sources throughout the entire contract;  (2) maintain a centralized database of these data that is compatible with and includes previously collected data and is formatted for GIS analyses;  (3) conduct on-water boater education and vessel data collection;   (4) conduct vessel-based behavioral surveys of killer whales and vessels;  (5)  maintain 5 sites in the SeaSound hydrophone network and deploy additional sites as feasible , (6) develop outreach/education exhibits/programs;   and  (7)  review available long-term data sets on killer whale sightings, vessel activities and ambient/anthropogenic sound around killer whales to conduct trend analyses for the purposes of generating data trends reports suitable for publication.</p>
<p>TASK REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Task 1:  Killer whale sighting database - The vendor will compile all killer whale detection data (sightings and acoustic detections) from inland and coastal waters of Washington, Oregon, and California each year. Southern Resident killer whale sightings should also include, to the extent possible, sightings/detections in British Columbia.  Data collected should have the same variables as previously collected data to include date, time, descriptive location, latitude/longitude, fishery area, direction, count, pod/subpod, comments, and information source. The vendor shall follow-up on reports with incomplete or questionable information.</p>
<p>The vendor will enlist the support of outside sources, as needed, for the collection and compilation of killer whale sighting data. Data from sources in central and southern Puget Sound is to be included.</p>
<p>Task 2:  Soundwatch Vessel Education and Monitoring Program - The vendor shall provide on-water education to boaters and monitor vessel activity and compliance with existing guidelines and regulations.  Program shall be conducted to support Be Whale Wise guidelines and Federal regulations.  As part of the Soundwatch program, additional hours of vessel monitoring and outreach specific to kayaks and the K.E.L.P. program will be conducted. Data collection on vessels, including kayaks, and kayak education complements the current Be Whale Wise campaign. The vendor will conduct additional outreach to boaters and regional boating communities about new vessel regulations utilizing new vessel regulations and updated Be Whale Wise materials.  Vendor will provide a minimum of 50 on-the water monitoring and education days with the option to provide additional days on a daily rate basis. For the kayak component, the vendor will provide a minimum of 40 days outreach, 10 days naturalist training, 20 days data collection for monitoring and compliance, with the option to provide additional days on a daily rate basis.</p>
<p>Task 3: Description of vessel activities around Southern Resident killer whales -</p>
<p>3a. The vendor shall report seasonal and yearly trends in vessel activities around the whales for specific year(s) identified by the NWFSC Reports will include historic and current data in a format consistent with previous reporting.   Data will be collected according to standardized protocols to allow for comparison between years.</p>
<p>3b. The vendor will collect data on kayakers in proximity to Southern Resident killer whales along the Westside of San Juan Island. Data will be collected according to existing program protocols to allow for comparison between years.</p>
<p>Task 4:  Vessel-based behavioral surveys of killer whales and vessels -</p>
<p>4a. Surveys shall be conducted using an integrated equipment package which includes a global positioning system (GPS) with built-in data collector to record attribute data (e.g. whale identification, group size, and behaviors), a laser rangefinder to determine distance, and a compass for bearing.  These components shall be physically/electronically connected and synchronized to generate geo-referenced data for focal whales and vessels.  Two integrated equipment packages should be used to collect data simultaneously, with the first package dedicated to collecting data from killer whales and the second package dedicated to collecting data from vessels in the vicinity of the killer whales.</p>
<p>4b. Characterize the behavior of killer whales in the absence of vessel traffic and at varying levels of vessel traffic over a range of geographic areas.  Behaviors should be recorded and categorized according to published behavioral states of killer whales. Additional criteria are as outlined.</p>
<p>1. Detailed group behavioral data, including behavior state and spatial structure, shall be collected from groups of focal animals representing the range of age-classes present (e.g. adult females, adult males, calves, juveniles, etc.).</p>
<p>2. Identify focal animals from existing photo identification databases so that behavioral responses of different pods can be compared.</p>
<p>4c. Collect data on vessel characteristics and behavior simultaneously with the collection of killer whale behavioral data during varying levels of vessel traffic and over several geographic regions.  Also characterize the number of vessels present, types of vessels present, distance between killer whales and vessels, and vessel activity.  Additional criteria are as outlined.</p>
<p>1. Collect data to assess whether vessel operators are more, less, or equally compliant with current voluntary whale watching boating guidelines in the presence of monitoring and/or enforcement vessels, and whether certain vessel types and/or vessel operators are more/less often in violation of particular guidelines.</p>
<p>2. Collect data on the vessel type and exact distance between the vessel and the tagged whale.</p>
<p>This task may also be conducted in conjunction with Dtag deployments.</p>
<p>Task 5:  Hydrophone monitoring network - Repair, maintain, and expand the existing hydrophone sites (Lime Kiln Lighthouse, NW San Juan Island, Seattle Aquarium, Port Townsend, and Neah Bay).  In consultation with the NWFSC, expand the network with additional hydrophone sites. Maintain and improve upon the automated detection, localization, classification, and notification system which provides near real-time alerts via email and/or text message.  Expand system to include an app for using mobile devices like iPhones or Androids to listen live (e.g. at sites like Lime Kiln) and/or report human detections of killer whale locations (e.g. upon hearing sounds on the live streams or sighting orcas).  Vendor will provide estimates for time and materials for repair, maintenance, and expansion on a per node basis.</p>
<p>Task 6:  Acoustic Outreach program - Maintain the hydrophone outreach infrastructure and update existing exhibit and web content(including use of web cameras), develop acoustic outreach programs for killer whales, including interactive exhibits, listening station software, and web-based tools. The outreach programs will complement existing information, hydrophones, and infrastructure at The Whale Museum, Port Townsend Marine Science Center, the Seattle Aquarium, the Makah Cultural Center, and at educational facilities associated with future hydrophone sites.  Expand acoustic outreach programs to include Lime Kiln Lighthouse and other nodes where appropriate.  Messages and signage for acoustic programs will be consistent with information in the Recovery Plan for Southern Resident killer whales and other NOAA outreach materials.</p>
<p>Task 7:  Multi-year data compilation - Periodically, not to exceed once a year, the vendor will compile historic killer whale sightings, vessel activities and ambient/anthropogenic sound around Southern Resident killer whales, and shall report trends and spatial patterns for specific year(s) and parameters consistent with previous reporting.</p>
<p>Additional Tasks:   Tasks may be issued to the vendor to address issues that may arise in the study of the killer whales. Such projects may include social organization, prey relationships, vessel interactions, movements and distribution, and health assessment. This list is not inclusive but is given to provide the type of studies that may be required.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  An indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) five year contract is being considered.  It will consist of a 1- year base period followed by four 1-year option periods.  The contract is expected to be awarded by Summer 2018.</p>

<p>BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)<br />Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.</p>
<p><br />VENDORMATE<br />Vendormate Credentialing Requirement<br />Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth (NMCP) has instituted a Credentialing Program which is designed to streamline the collection and management of key information regarding the regulatory and compliance status as well as business operations of our suppliers. <br />The program requires all vendors and their representatives to register in order to gain base access to NMCP. One nominal annual credentialing fee covers your company as well as all representatives of your company that interact with NMCP.<br />The price ranges from $25 to $250 per year depending on your company's risk profile and is paid directly to our partner, Vendormate Credentialing. It is imperative that each representative registers individually to maintain their personal credentials and ensure ongoing base access to our facility. <br />A Federal Tax Identification Number and a credit card are required to complete the initial registration. Additional representatives only need the Federal Tax Identification Number.<br />Register for Vendormate Credentialing at https://nmcp.vendormate.com.<br />For technical questions, go to https://ghx.com/customer-care.<br />Kiosks are located on the first and second floor entrances of Building two (2). Your representatives who visit NMCP may be required to sign in electronically to obtain an identification badge. With a valid appointment and current credentials, your representative will be able to print a single-use badge that is to be worn throughout the visit to any NMCP facility. Badges are required for all vendors on premises.<br />Please note that GHX Vendormate Credentialing is in addition to RapidGate for Base Access. Vendors are required to register for both programs in order to come onboard the NMCP base.</p>

<p><br />CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section I - Contract Clauses</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

All provisions and clauses referenced in this combined synopsis/solicitation can be found at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/<br />Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial.<br />The vendor shall provide three separately identifiable Volumes using the following conventions:</p>
<p>Factor 1 ~ Technical Instructions</p>
<p>Volume 1 ~ Technical Volume, Vendor Name, Total pages (This Volume shall not exceed 40 pages.)</p>
<p>a. The technical volume shall include a contractor developed wire diagram of all cable runs and connections using MS PowerPoint. MS Visio, or MS Word equivalent products which are easily followed and reflect a professional wire diagram. Formal architectural renderings are not expected. This product shall be provided to the government and the government will retain the rights to this diagram. This diagram shall be used to support future maintenance or upgrades as required.</p>
<p>b. Technical capability shall be evaluated by how well what the vendors proposes to meet the PWS and the equipment offered which meets or exceeds the Government requirement. The technical volume shall further support how the vendor will integrate all features of this project, and a timeline to completion. NOTE, if equivalent but not exact pieces of equipment are offered, a complete and exact comparison between what is requested by the government and what is offered by the vendor shall be delivered. Vendors are cautioned to clearly and without interpretation on the part of the government reflect to the government how their offered equipment is equal to or equivalent to the brand name equipment requested in the equipment table. To further this point, the equipment requested by the government supports a standardization of equipment across all video teleconference suites in the Idaho Army National Guard and in order to attain efficiency of knowledge, understanding and training opportunities, this equipment type furthers that intent.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance Instructions<br />Volume 2 ~ Past Performance Volume, Vendor Name, Total pages (This Volume shall not exceed 15 pages.)</p>
<p>Past performance summary information shall be captured in the attached Past Performance Questionnaire at Attachment 2. In doing so, identify past or current Government contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. You shall provide full names and current phone numbers of references that the Government can contact. Failure to provide this information will result in a neutral rating.<br />a. Problems encountered on the identified contracts and any corrective actions must be included in the quote.<br />b. Past performance information will be considered recent if the contract was active within the last three (3) years as of the date of solicitation opening. Past performance information will be considered relevant if the contract included the same or similar requirements to the SOW and performance of tasks similar to the tasks listed in the SOW included in this solicitation. Past performance information will be reviewed to determine the recency and relevance of the information.<br />c.
