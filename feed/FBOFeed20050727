<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) intends to acquire services for the visual survey of Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) host trees using tree climbers and bucket trucks within the State of New Jersey and the State of New York.  These services will cover the NJ infestation in Middlesex/Union Counties and the NY infestation in Islip Long Island, NY.  The contiguous survey area in NJ covers approximately 16.4 square miles within the cities/municipalities of Rahway, Linden, Carteret, and the Avenel Section of Woodbridge Township.  There are approximately 38,000 ALB host trees within this area with an average dbh of 10 inches.  In NY, the contiguous survey area located in Islip Long Island covers approximately 7 miles square miles with an estimated number of 76,000 ALB host trees with an average dbh of 10 inches.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Mimosa, Hackberry, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Visual surveys using tree climbers and bucket trucks to perform the inspections are a vital component to the success of the ALB Eradication Program.  USDA is looking to accomplish two goals through these survey contracts:  1) Detect all ALB infested trees in order to eliminate the infestation as quickly as possible and 2)  Confirm eradication by accomplishing repeated negative surveys on all ALB host trees within the targeted areas.  This is a firm fixed price, completion contract anticipated for 12 months beginning October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006 with unilateral options up to four years to extend the effective period.  It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $6.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about August 8, 2005, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer by September 9, 2005.

<DESC>The New Mexico VA Health Care System (NMVAHCS) if searching for sources that can provide the following: The Cooperative Studies Program Clinical Research Clinical Research Coordinating Center (CSPCRPCC) has a requirement to obtain MS SQL/relational database training and coaching for approximately 5 - 8 individuals. The training/coaching time will be divided between classroom type instruction for the 5 - 8 individuals and one-on-one instruction/coaching. The training/coaching will be conducted at the CSPCRPCC facility in Albuquerque, with the required hardware and software provided by the CSPCRPCC. The CSPCRPCC will be transitioning from dBase IV to MS SQL and will require training and guidance throughout this process. The CSPCRPCC will require a needs assessment, evaluating the current state of the transition project and recommend a plan for moving forward. The needs assessment will, at a minimum, consider the following: a view to what level the database transition team has taken their data modeling and database design efforts, a better understanding of the various relationships between what will be legacy systems and what will be updated systems, what "front end" applications are to interface with the new system and what modifications may be necessary to make that interface possible, an understanding of what resources have been or are expected to be put into place to facilitate the project, a better comprehension of what support and training team members will require. The following training and assistance will also be required: helping team members relate experience in Oracle and MySQL environments to a SQL environment, creating an analysis of the existing environment and using that analysis to conceptualize and design the desired operating environment, redefining activities based on the enhanced functionalities available in the desired operating environment and including these features in the design and development of that environment, designing and developing an environment that is capable of supporting both the new development and also legacy applications that are not targeted for transition, deploying portions of the new environment over the Internet, applying current "front-end" technologies to feed the newer database environment and reduce development and deployment times. The CSPCRPCC also requires the flexibility to redefine objectives, topics and delivery methodologies along the way as the need is perceived or arises. This sources sought does not constitute an order of any kind nor does it guarantee that an order will be generated in the near future. If you have any questions please contact Cesar T Fausto by e-mail or fax.

The IDS will incorporate much functionality demonstrated in the TSE, but as applied to the analysis of industrial regulations and their potential impact. Interested parties who believe they can meet the Agency’s requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating their technical capabilities which shall be considered by the agency.   In your response you must address each of the items described in the Statement of Work in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement.

A written affirmative response must be received no later than forty-five days after the publication of this synopsis.  The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) utilizing the Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 15.

CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a! ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!  for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revi! sed performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment! , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. To be eligible for award you must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.  Lack of registration in the CCR shall make an offeror INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD. Past performance will be evaluated using the Navy's RED/YELLOW/GREEN program as follows: (A) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System, Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) program. RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of ! proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), has a requirement to provide services for parametric engineering, procurement, and operating and support cost modeling for nuclear and non-nuclear propulsion systems for various size surface combatant ships. NSWCCD intends to negotiate with only one source and issue a firm-fixed price purchase order to Technomics, Inc., Arlington, Virginia 22202. Technomics, Inc. has the existing parametric cost models for engineering, procurement,operating, and support cost which have been developed for SEA 0175 in support of nuclear carrier cost estimates (Contract # NOO167-02-F-0086). Mr. Paul Hardin, has developed these models and has used them to support several other DON ACAT I acquisition program cost estimates. These models must be modified to perform the necessary tradeoffs required by this study, Mr. Hardin has worked extensively in the past with the NAVSEA 08 and NAVSEA 0175 cost analysts who will also be participating in this study. These models are required to augment the work being completed by Code 2110 and SEA 0175 personnel. Technomics is also currently under contract with NSWC-CD Code 2110 to perform similar ship propulsion trade study support to the USCG (Contract # N00178-04-D-4042). The knowledge and information from that work is directly applicable to this study and will allow a better product to be delivered th! an otherwise possible from another source, In order to maintain consistency with previous nuclear propulsion cost estimates by utilizing the existing parametric models developed by Technomics, Inc. In order to successfully fulfill the requirements within the specified timeframe for completing the CNOG study and to avoid duplication of effort and costs to redevelop similar parametric cost models, it is necessary to utilize the existing models to complete the analysis required for this cost estimate. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The project will consist of preparation of a suitable seedbed, seed native and non-invasive vegetation, control noxious weeds and irrigate until the plants are well established.  After establishment of native and non-invasive plant species is achieved (2 years) the water rights will be removed.  Irrigation water will be temporarily transferred by the Navy to the 300-acre buffer zone until native plant species are established.  Native and non-invasive plant communities at NASF typically consist of salt desert shrubs, Four-wing Saltbush, Shadscale, Greasewood, Quailbush and perennial bunch grasses such as creeping wild rye, wheatgrass, and alkali sacaton. The precipitation average in this desert is 5 inches per year. To control the soil erosion and restore the native habitat, the weeds need to be controlled and the 300 acres replanted. This project shall convert old agricultural lands, 300 acres, to native and non-invasive vegetation. Irrigation water is available from the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District (April-November). Graded border irrigation is the method of irrigation used in this valley. This parcel was irrigated last in 1998. Re-vegetating Agricultural Outleases with native and non-invasive plant species complies with the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Management of the Greenbelt at NAS Fallon, The NAS Fallon Agricultural Outlease Land Management Plan, State of Nevada and Churchill County dust control regulations.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) Surveillance Research and Applications Program (SRAP) plans to procure on a sole source basis for services regarding: Cancer Surveillance Trend Estimates from Multiple Data Sets with the University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine, Center for Clinical Epidemiology & Biostatistics, 617 Blockley Hall, 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA  19104-6021.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 611310 and the business size standard is $6M. The Statistical Research and Applications Branch (SRAB) conducts and supports statistical research, modeling, and collaboration related to the cancer surveillance and cancer control missions of the NCI.  Essential corollaries to the development of cancer surveillance databases and cancer control interventions are the statistical analyses and mathematical modeling that contribute insight into the interpretation of these data. Research within SRAB is targeted at improving and developing statistical methods and models for use in the analysis and presentation of population-based cancer statistics, as well as in the broader areas of cancer surveillance and cancer control research. SRAB promotes and facilitates the use of these methods and models at NCI, in other federal agencies, as well as throughout the extramural research community.  In 2001, small area estimates were developed for the period 1997-2000 using data from National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) for a number of outcomes of interest to cancer surveillance researchers including the following:  1) smoking (current and lifetime) and 2) cancer screening examinations (pap smear, mammography, sigmoidoscopy, and blood stool).  In addition, in 2003, simulation was used to study the validity of NCHS/BRFSS combined estimates.  Direct estimates of prevalence for smoking and cancer screening examinations have been published in connection with the Healthy People 2010 project.  Period of Performance: 9/01/05– 8/31/06.  The University of Pennsylvania, Instructor of Biostatistics, Dr. Dawei Xie, over the past several years, has been instrumental in developing the computer implementation of the statistical algorithms and the theoretical background that supports the Cancer Surveillance Trend Estimates from Multiple Data Sets research project.  In addition, she developed the computer algorithms, computer codes, assembled covariates, and coordinated the implementation on the internal data with National Center for Heath Statistics (NCHS) staff.  Dr. Dawei Xie, in collaboration with Dr. Trivellore Raghunathan, Professor at the University of Michigan, has led and continues to lead, the NCHS/NCI combining surveys project.  The University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Dawei Xie, is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the expertise required, in collaboration with Dr. Trivellore Raghunathan, project consultant, University of Michigan, to perform the services in Cancer Surveillance Trend Estimates from Multiple Data Sets required by the NCI.   The University of Pennsylvania and its’ staff is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the already developed computer algorithms, computer codes, etc., to fulfill the continued services for the NCI research project, Cancer Surveillance Trend Estimates from Multiple Data Sets.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Acquisitions Management and Operations Branch (AMOB) has a sole source requirement for assistance in the establishment and maintenance of an Emerging Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network (EID CRN) in Southeast Asia.  The services necessary for this requirement include, but are not limited to: the establishment of clinical research sites; development and monitoring of quality control systems; providing expert scientific advice regarding clinical study/trial design, protocol development, implementation, and logistics; and providing training to support the EID CRN in Southeast Asia.  NIAID anticipates the award of a five year cost plus fixed fee/completion type contract beginning on or about September 30, 2005 to Oxford University at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1.  Oxford University at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in HCMC Vietnam is the only responsible source for this requirement. Oxford University is currently the only potential contractor who possesses the ability to collaborate with the existing clinical research capacity in Vietnam and has the potential to prepare and implement a human Avian Influenza (AI) treatment study by early 2006. The HCMC Oxford Unit has been in existence for over 10 years and has crucial local and government relationships.  Oxford has established a working collaborative relationship with three sites in Vietnam, one in HCMC and two in Hanoi, for future influenza studies.  These sites are essential to the success of the initial clinical research network.  In addition, Oxford has: existing clinical research sites in Vietnam that have given them experience in conducting therapeutic clinical trials in AI; established real time PCR diagnosis of AI; the ability to establish a reference laboratory for real time diagnostics; the current expertise and capacity to establish a reference lab for pharmacokinetics; the ability to train technicians in real time AI diagnosis; the authority to transfer funds and transport equipment to and within Vietnam; and existing relationships and approvals with the Vietnamese Ministry of Health and Vietnamese government to conduct clinical trials research in Avian Influenza.    The time and resources that would be required for another firm to develop these types of relationships and skills would be prohibitive to the efficient implementation of this program.  For these reasons NIAID believes that no offeror can fulfill the existing needs for the support of the establishment and maintenance of an EID CRN in Southeast Asia.  Please refer any questions in writing to Terrie Nestor at tnestor@niaid.nih.gov on or before September 12, 2005 at 2:00pm.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to award a sole source contract for the development and implementation of the National Biosafety and Biocontainment Training Program (NBBTP). The NBBTP provides post-graduate professional training in biosafety and biocontainment of emerging and re-emerging infectious disease agents and agents that may be used intentionally to cause public health or economic harm.  The NBBTP was established specifically to support the United States civilian biodefense research initiative by providing highly trained and qualified biosafety professionals to oversee and manage the conduct of research with these agents.  NBBTP provides two-year training fellowships to meet this critical need. The following tasks are to be included under this requirement: 1). Develop a working model of the program; 2). Develop a comprehensive curriculum organized around the central concepts of biosafety and high-level biocontainment; 3). Implement a training and education paradigm that will provide the training and education necessary for biosafety professionals to manage and operate high level biocontainment laboratories;  4). Develop and implement an administrative structure and organization; and, 5). Develop and implement a program oversight and evaluation strategy to ensure the highest levels of training and performance. Services will be procured on a sole source basis from the Frontline Healthcare Workers Safety Foundation, a not-for-profit educational foundation. The Frontline Healthcare Workers Foundation is the only not-for-profit educational and research institution in the United States administering and conducting a professional biosafety and biocontainment training program. Currently, there is no other training resource available in the US that can provide comprehensive, two-year instruction on biosafety practice and the design, operation and management of biocontainment laboratories.  The Foundation is currently providing these services and has developed a curriculum that will be enhanced to meet the NIAID requirements. Their current and previous efforts have provided them with unique abilities and experience to complete this requirement.  The continuance and expansion of the NBBTP is critically needed in support of the national and regional biodefense laboratory network. For these reasons, the Government believes that no other offerors have the capability to provide these services. Any questions regarding this requirement should be addressed to Michele DiNatale at (301) 402-5644 or dinatalem@niaid.nih.gov before the synopsis closing date of September 12, 2005. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 514210   In accordance with FAR Part 12 Simplified Procedures, the U.S. EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) requires a contractor to provide Data Processing Program Development for the Mobile Source Observation Database (MSOD).   OTAQ administers portions of Title II of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 and 1990.  Within OTAQ, the Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) does a wide range of work in support of EPA's efforts in air quality analysis.  These efforts include creating and revising emissions  estimation tools, developing regulatory impact analyses, testing vehicles, supporting the vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs, and other related projects. ASD has developed an ERD data model in ERwin v4.1 and implemented an Oracle9i relational database system containing a variety of  emission test results and other observations and measurements of motor vehicles and their engines. This database system is called the Mobile Source Observation Database (MSOD).   Currently, the MSOD, residing on a Windows NT server maintained by EPA, contains approximately 140 tables with the  largest table "DYNOTIME" with approximately fifteen million records. EPA is expecting the MSOD to grow quickly due to a large amount of incoming data. On MSOD, there is a set of Windows QA/QC/Load programs, written in Visual Basic 6.0 and Visual FoxPro 8.0, for checking input data and loading data.  General information about the MSOD is available on EPA's web site http://www.epa.gov/OTAQ/models.htm.  The contractor shall improve the current MSOD programs, i.e., QA/QC program (VALDATA) and loading program (EFLOAD), and process and load approximately 1000 gigabytes in raw data size of new  datasets of I/M program, Remote Sensing Data (RSD) program, and Kansas City project.  The contractor shall specifically conduct the following work (1) Fix Existing Program Bugs, (2) Add Composite Test Result, (3) Allow NULL Value of Categorized Fields, (4) Simplify Synchronization Among Databases,  (5) Add Multiple Work Assignments to QC SPEC.DBF File, (6) Make Key Field "MSID" More Transparent to Users, (7) QA/QC/Load New Datasets from I/M Program, Remote Sensing Data (RSD) Program, and Kansas City Project, and (8) Collaborate with EPA to Complete Integration and Acceptance Testing. This  procurement is a small business set-aside under NAICS code 518210 with a size standard of $21,000,000.  Award will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the Agency.  Any firm believing itself capable of providing the  required Data Processing Program Development for the Mobile Source Observation Database (MSOD) must request a copy of the RFQ in writing within fifteen (15) days of electronic posting of this notice.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management
Division, on behalf of the Quantum Electrical Metrology Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Fluke Electronics of Everett, WA for a Calibrator, Fluke, Model #5720A (with Option 3).  This equipment is needed to support the Multifunction Calibration Laboratory in the Division.

Measurements for this system require a very stable source capable of delivering direct and alternating voltages, resistance, and direct and alternating currents with high resolution, accuracy, and stability.  The system this calibrator will be integrated into uses software which has been developed specifically for this calibrator.

Sole source determination is based on the following: This instrument is the only known calibrator to meet NIST’s minimum specifications that include the following:  AC voltage output from 10 mV to 1000 V from 10 Hz to 1 MHz.  AC voltage to 3 V to 30 MHz; DC voltage output from 100 mV to 1000 V, AC current from 100 uA to 1 A from 10 Hz to 10 kHz, resistance from 1 ohm to 100 Mohm.  The minimum stability requirements are:  AC voltage: 25uV/V 24-hour stability; DC Voltage: 0.9uV/V 24-hour stability; Resistance: 2.0 uohm/ohm 24-hour stability; and DC current: 24 uA/A 24-hour stability.  In addition, the system this calibrator will be integrated into uses software which has been developed specifically for this calibrator.  Use of an alternate system would require significant software revisions causing NIST to incur significant expense, loss of time, and loss of use of the system during the revision.

No solicitation package will be issued.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by August 2, 2005, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The grantee is the Government of Nigeria, through the Office of the Presidential Advisor in Petroleum and Energy Matters.

The Technical Assistance Project proposed here is a complex project.  It essentially consists of the following:

·	A review of current LPG infrastructure and market situation and the establishment of working relationships with the Government of Nigeria, relevant National Assembly Committees, and industry.
·	A review of legislative and regulatory shortcomings in the market and the development of remedial regulatory steps designed to return order to the market.  Design of a functioning regulatory regime for LPG, ready for immediate implementation.
·	An assessment of the reserves and productive capacity of marginal oil and gas fields in the Niger Delta Region as a new source for LPG. Projection of volumes and sequencing of newly developed oil and gas streams.
·	An analysis of the existing LPG distribution and storage facilities and the construction of a new depot near Abuja, development of financial documentation required to sell storage depots to private investors and an aggressive promotional program to effect the rapid sale of the depots.
·	A review of current safety problems related to LPG cylinders and the development and implementation of concrete recommendations and practical steps to restore safety and public acceptance in marketing LPG in portable cylinders.
·	A broad-brushed impact statement discussing the task-specific developmental and environmental consequences of the marketing structure, supply, distribution and storage, and LP Gas cylinder activities described above, plus an overall assessment of the consequences of the transition of large parts of the Nigerian economy from wood to LPG as a household fuel.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $562,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The Information Directorate, Command and Control Engineering Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for innovative technologies to support Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) applications.  Of particular interest are technologies that can significantly reduce the time between information technology availability and its employment into the research and development programs that support legacy and new military electronic systems.  Also of interest are commercial technologies that can improve the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and useability of these new and legacy military electronic systems.  Access to Rome Research Site laboratories, including such legacy systems as Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS), Master Caution Panel (MCP), Joint Air & Space Management & Deconfliction (JASMAD), and others, will be provided as necessary.  This effort will investigate the application and/or development of emerging and in-use commercial information technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas:  (1)  Legacy and evolving Air Force C4I systems:  This area covers not only technological upgrades to the existing Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) command and control structure/functions, but also revolutionary concepts for future operations centers, such as the Advanced Technology Air and Space Operations Center (AT-AOC).  Examples of the applicable technologies are advanced distributed architectures, publish/subscribe concepts and architectures, distributed computing environments, real-time processing, digital graphics, portable/wearable/mobile computational devices, and advanced displays/user interfaces.  (2)  Simulation and modeling technologies applicable to Air Force C4I systems:  Simulation and modeling for this purpose represent the full range of applications from supporting the development of the individual components within an Air Force C4I system to developing course of action evaluation tools to facilitate the AOC planning function.  Examples of these technologies include:  model abstraction, multi-resolution modeling, model interoperability, real-time simulation systems, advanced simulation architectures, C4I concept evaluations, long haul networked simulations utilizing HLA and other standard protocols, and application of these, or other, technologies to the concepts of rehearsal, dynamic planning/execution, and dynamic battle management.  (3)  Technology for integration, test, and demonstration of Air Force C4I systems:  systems integration and demonstration are used here to represent the spectrum of testing, evaluation, and demonstration that is typically conducted during the development, integration, and fielding phases of an Air Force C4I system and any of its component parts.  Examples of these technologies are those that are involved with the integration, measurement, assessment, and demonstration of information, Command and Control, communications, and enterprise systems as they relate to, or are part of, legacy and developing Air Force C4I systems.  (4)  Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems:  This area encompasses all information technology that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I systems/applications.  Examples of these technologies are data retrieval/mining, data storage, software/system monitors, data visualization, data busses, publish/subscribe mechanisms, digital moving maps, and decision making techniques.  (5)  Development of technology to enhance and enable the use of collaborative environments in AF C4ISR systems and enterprises:  This refers to development of individual collaboration tools, as well as the larger collaborative environment which results from networking the individual tools for simultaneous employment with multiple users that are widely dispersed.  Examples of these technologies are collaborative engineering and virtual prototyping environments which enable the collaborative development and application of information, air planning, and enterprise technologies/applications.

V.  APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1)  the overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal, (2)  the innovativeness of the proposed approach and technologies, (3)  the applicability of the proposed technologies to proposed and legacy military electronic systems, and (4)  Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.   

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include:  a.  assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b.  accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c.  handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical/program manager POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical/program manager POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical/program manager POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

White papers previously submitted under BAA 03-02-IFKA will be considered for funding under this announcement and need not be resubmitted.

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award.  In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA.  Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

<DESC>The IPV contractor will employ a supplier/manufacturer network with the resources, finances & supply chain management capability to support planned & un-planned requirements.  The logistics solutions will integrate the various sources of supply, thereby achieving robust competition at the supplier level, while still providing seamless interface with DLA & its Air Force customers.  This sophisticated logistics solution requires a continuous open exchange of information between customer, supplier network & DLA.  A seamless logistics system with state-of-the-art information technology (IT) & assured communications is essential for optimum support & total asset visibility.  This program provides total supply chain management in support of consumables used in maintenance, repair & overhaul of Air Force weapon systems.  The contractor will employ a combination of commercial & government-DLA sources of supply in the performance of logistics support.  The contract will also include provisions in support of Worldwide Demand (WWD) requirements for selected items; Just-in-Time support; & at least a 99% fill rate for all schedule of item requirements.  This solicitation's customer base are three Air Logistic Centers (ALCs): Warner Robins, GA; Oklahoma City, OK; and Ogden, UT.  The contract scope includes approximately 52,000 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) with a total estimated annual value of  $75,000,000.00.  The Market Basket shall consist of commercially sourced items which represent the profile of commercially sourced items for the contract term, which are a subpopulation of the schedule of items.  Some items will be designated WWD & some will be designated site specific.  Unanticipated non-repetitive requirements will be supported by Spot-buys which are acqisitions based on customer urgency.  For each NSN on the Market Basket and the subsequent contract, offerors are required to provide a unit price & a total price for each NSN, a material management price and a grand total evaluated price (Note: All estimated prices are fully burdened to include Material cost, Profit & F.O.B. Destination).  It is the Government's intent to issue an Indefinite Quantity, Fixed-Priced with EPA contract.  The solicitation will contain a 3-year base period with two (2) 2-year options and one (1) 3-year option.  The solicitation will utilize 'Best Value Source Selection' procedures.  The government will consider other factors in addition to price when evaluating proposals to determine the best overall expected value.  Technical merit is considered significantly more important than price.  The evaluation factors will be Technical Merit; Past Performance; Socio-Economic Consideration; Javits-Wagner-O'Day considerations & DLA Mentoring Businesses Agreement Program.  Just-in-Time deliveries to Air Force sites (not the World Wide demand requirements) will be required.  Offerors will be required to submit a delivery schedule for the WWD quantities for each of the items listed in the Market Basket.  Note: Deliveries may vary among product lines; offerors are required to provide a delivery schedule for each.  The Trade Agreement Act applies to all items except those in FSG 95. The deadline for receipt of proposals will be forty-five (45) days from the solicitation issue date.  DSCP plans on conducting site visits approximately two or three weeks after the solicitation issue date.  The Schedule-of-Items and the Market Basket can be obtained, WHEN THE SOLICITATION IS ISSUED, by accessing the DSCP website at www.dscp.dla.mil./gi/general/ipvsites.html.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

General Characteristics:  The Dome Shelters are a group of shelters used for a variety of applications including warehousing and as an aircraft hanger.  The shelters do not require a foundation and can be erected on both a smooth natural site relatively free of surface rock or on a pre-existing concrete pad.  The domes consist of an aluminum arched frame, tensioned weatherproof fabric, and an electrical system.  The shelters can be erected and disassembled from ground level.  All tools necessary for erection and disassembly are included in the shelter package.  The various configurations have different lengths, door types, end walls, and electrical systems.

The 4K Dome Shelter (5410-01-363-0090EJ) has two Big Mouth Doors that span the shelter width.  It is approximately 60 feet by 60 feet yielding a square footage on the order of 4000 square feet.  The 8K Dome Shelter (5410-01-494-5130EJ) also has two Big Mouth Doors, but has twice as many body panels, approximately doubling the length of the shelter.  The 4K Dome Shelter (5410-01-455-2004EJ) with gabled (flat) end wall is similar to the 4K Dome Shelter, but a flat end all replaces one of the Big Mouth Doors.

The Dome Hanger Extension Assembly (5410-01-500-7537EJ) is not a stand alone item.  It contains the components to create a Dome Hanger Extension Assembly (5410-01-512-3416EJ) that is approximately 5000 square feet, from an existing 4K.  The dome extension contains additional aluminum frame, replacement fabric for the entire shelter, a replacement lighting system, and additional component, including electrical.

Dome Shelters and the Dome Extension Assembly each will require a First Article.  Condition(s) for Waiver of First Article Approval:  Offerors currently in production of the same or similar article for an Air Force contract and who have received First Article approval under the existing contract or offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar articles to the Air Force, provided articles thus furnished, have exhibited satisfactory performance in service in the opinion of the Air Force or provided not more than 60 months have elapsed since completion of the contract.

Electronic procedures will be posted for this solicitation on or around 15 Apr 05 and will be posted under RFP FA8518-05-R-75816 at http://www.fedbizops.gov/.  Government Data/Drawings will be available for these items and will be posted with the solicitation.

<DESC>SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AT http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Proposal due date remains 27-May-2005, close-of-business.  The project will consist of preparation of a suitable seedbed, seed native and non-invasive vegetation, control noxious weeds and irrigate until the plants are well established.  After establishment of native and non-invasive plant species is achieved (2 years) the water rights will be removed.  Irrigation water will be temporarily transferred by the Navy to the 300-acre buffer zone until native plant species are established.  Native and non-invasive plant communities at NASF typically consist of salt desert shrubs, Four-wing Saltbush, Shadscale, Greasewood, Quailbush and perennial bunch grasses such as creeping wild rye, wheatgrass, and alkali sacaton. The precipitation average in this desert is 5 inches per year. To control the soil erosion and restore the native habitat, the weeds need to be controlled and the 300 acres replanted. This project shall convert old agricultural lands, 300 acres, to native and non-invasive vegetation. Irrigation water is available from the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District (April-November). Graded border irrigation is the method of irrigation used in this valley. This parcel was irrigated last in 1998. Re-vegetating Agricultural Outleases with native and non-invasive plant species complies with the Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Management of the Greenbelt at NAS Fallon, The NAS Fallon Agricultural Outlease Land Management Plan, State of Nevada and Churchill County dust control regulations.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Improved Process Manufacturing
<SOLNBR>ORDC-VB-05-07

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government. An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Although domestic vaccine supply and usage has gradually risen over the past decade and incremental expansion of domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity is anticipated over the next decade, private sector investment in surge capacity to meet the vaccine requirement in a pandemic is unlikely. 
       
One means to increase vaccine capacity is to increase the yield of vaccine product incrementally at various stages in the vaccine manufacturing process. Further modifications of present influenza vaccine manufacturing processes may be productive in increasing product stability. Taken together these improvements could have positive impacts on surge capacity during times of vaccine shortage and in the event of an influenza pandemic. 
       
The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple contract awards to improve the manufacturing process of influenza vaccines to achieve greater product yields and potentially shorter production cycles. Contracts will be awarded to influenza vaccine manufacturers or their corporate partners, which have vaccine manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. and which plan and implement a coordinated and integrated systematic strategy to enhance influenza vaccine manufacturing. The vaccine manufacturing activities that may be pursued include raw material selection and qualification, upstream processing, downstream processing, vaccine formulation, and final product presentation. Other activities supported by this RFP include manufacturing, clinical evaluation, and validation of pilot investigational and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccines manufactured by the improved processes. 

Eligibility requirements of vaccine manufacturers for these contracts include the following: (1) Licensure and manufacturing of vaccines for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing, clinical development, and FDA-licensure of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage in the U.S. market; and (3) Documented development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 
       
The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to expand the domestic influenza vaccine capacity for seasonal and pandemic influenza. The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-07 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

Release of the solicitation has been delayed and is currently projected for September 2005.

<DESC>Preparing to address the challenges of natural or man-made health threats is a priority of the U.S. Government.  An influenza pandemic has a greater potential to cause more deaths and illnesses than virtually any other natural health threat. On the heels of three influenza pandemics in the 20th century, signs of a possible pandemic have emerged in Southeast Asia, as lethal infections of poultry and humans with avian influenza virus H5N1 continue and this virus is now endemic in bird populations, which increase the likelihood of continued human exposure.

The primary means to reduce influenza mortality and decrease disease severity is prophylactic immunization. Currently, U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines are comprised of 15 micrograms of hemagglutinin (HA) for each included virus strain and are administered intramuscularly. Studies recently have shown that antigen sparing effects have been elicited for monovalent influenza vaccines formulated with adjuvants and trivalent influenza vaccines administered intradermally. Antigen sparing approaches may increase overall influenza vaccine capacity in the short term by reducing the amount of HA antigen that may be needed in the vaccine by using adjuvants or by administering vaccines by alternate routes such as intradermally.   

The Department of Health and Human Services through the National Vaccine Program Office and Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to develop medical devices and/or domestically- manufactured antigen sparing influenza vaccines for FDA licensure and human usage.  The scope of activities for which the Offeror may request funds may include manufacturing and clinical evaluation of pilot and commercial scale lots of influenza vaccine using adjuvants or other immune enhancing substances. Funds may be used also for vaccine and medical device development and testing. 

Contracts will be awarded to companies or their corporate partners that have U.S. manufacturing facilities available for influenza vaccines, adjuvants, and/or medical devices, which may afford an antigen sparing effect. Other eligibility requirements of manufacturers and their corporate partners, if applicable, for these contracts include the following: (1) Documented history of development and clinical testing of vaccines, adjuvants, or medical devices for human usage; (2) Written commitment to U.S.-based manufacturing and clinical development leading toward FDA-licensure of pandemic influenza vaccines for human usage; and (3) Documented comprehensive development program for pandemic influenza vaccines using influenza viruses or genes. 

	The primary purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to facilitate late stage development and testing leading toward FDA-licensure of new antigen sparing influenza vaccines in U.S.-based manufacturing facilities.  The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of three years or 36 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.  RFP-DHHS-ORDC-V&B-05-08 will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract.  Only written or email requests, directly from the requestor, for this solicitation will be accepted.  No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

Release of the solicitation has been delayed and is currently projected for October 2005.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the July 2005 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-04.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519120 with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.  The mission of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is to collect, preserve and disseminate biomedical information.  In support of this mission the Library has assembled one of the largest collections of biomedical literature in the world and continues to collect in some forty biomedical areas and to a lesser degree in related areas.  In total the Library’s collections contain approximately 7.5 million print and non-print items.  The Library’s print collections are housed in the General Collection, the History of Medicine Division (HMD), and the Main and HMD Reading Rooms.  NLM’s serial collection contains approximately 92,000 serial titles (some with more than one holdings location).  Of that number 13,524 are titles that have been indexed by NLM (noted hereafter as IM titles).  Of the total number of IM titles, 4,850 titles currently are being indexed.  The baseline inventory will be an item by item review of bound and unbound serial items that number approximately 1,280,000 bound serial volumes and 8,000-11,000 unbound serial issues.  The work to be accomplished will consist of comparing physical volumes at the shelf with the online records, creating, correcting or deleting item records, adding barcodes and security labels, creating or correcting existing holdings records, and identifying and resolving or referring problems as instructed by NLM.  The serial titles to be inventoried are housed in the General Collection and HMD collections on the B1, B2 and B3 floor levels.  With the exception of titles in HMD and General Collection oversized volumes, the contractor staff shall complete the inventory of each title regardless of the shelving location(s), making sure that every title in the General Collection shelved on the B1 and B3 floor level is treated as a unit.  Serials shelved in a special area on B3 designated for oversized items (GENCOLLOV3) and HMD titles will be batched and inventoried separately by the contractor.  The inventory of each title shall begin with the first item on the shelf for the title through the last bound volume.  The unbound journal issues for open titles that were published beyond the last bound volume on the shelf will not be included in the inventory, although missing and lost item records shall be verified or corrected.  The following phases of the inventory are in priority order and shall be done in that order by the contractor:

Phase One:  	All W1, non-W1, and classed serials that have been indexed by NLM (IM titles), excluding indexed analyzed titles.  (Estimated 13,525 titles. in 13,720 shelving locations)
Phase Two:  	Non-Indexed W1 serials (Estimated 51,029 in 51,992 shelving locations)
Phase Three:  	Non-Indexed classed collection and W2 serials (Estimated 500 titles. in 503 shelving locations)
Phase Four:  	Analyzed titles   (Estimated 26,960 titles)

Most of the serial titles in HMD and many in the General Collection were published in foreign languages.  The contractor shall refer to Manual of European Languages for Librarians to decipher titles and volume information whenever necessary.  A copy of this reference tool will be provided to the contractor by the Project Officer along with other reference materials.  The NLM has scheduled a site visit to review the performance site.  The site visit is on Tuesday August 16, 2005 from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.

The Contractor's solution will provide all hardware, software, training, licenses, maintenance, supplies (less paper), etc. that are necessary for the execution of t his contract. The program requires thirty-six (36) machines providing 22 ppm copier/printer/fax, fourteen (14) machines providing 35 ppm copier/printer/fax, six (6) machines providing 45 ppm copier/printer/fax, five (5) machines providing 45 ppm copier/pri nter/fax/scan, one (1) machine providing 60 ppm copier/printer, account management tools, and a per copy cost for copies in excess of 3,000,000 per year. Contractor will provide a no-hassle satisfaction guarantee for all aspects of the program. The Governm ent's obligations under this contract shall be subject to the availability of funds for any of the ensuing Fiscal Years. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. The solicitation number is W912LD- 05-R-0002 and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). It will be made available on or about 1 October 2005 and will be posted to our web site at http://www.ripfo.ngb.army.mil/EBS/ADVERTISEDSOLICITATIONS.asp.  The NAICS code is 561439. All future informa tion regarding this acquisition, including amendments, will be distributed solely through this website.

The closing date for responses is no later than (NLT) 2:00PM on 25 October 2005. Award will be made to the Contractor whose proposal, responsive and conforming to the Request for Proposa ls (RFP), is determined to be the best value to the government. The best value is the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered, and consistent with the Government's state importance of evaluation criteria. This may result in an award bei ng made to a higher rated, higher priced Contractor where the Contracting Officer determines that the other factors of the higher-priced Contractor outweigh the cost difference. To arrive at a best value decision, the Contractor Officer will integrate the evaluation of Past Performance and Price; with Past Performance and Price of equal importance.

<DESC>The purpose of this questionnaire is to aid in determining the suitability of your equipment (with minor modification if necessary) to satisfy US Army requirements for an existing, commercially available (marketed) family of Airborne Graders.  The te chnical requirements are subject to change.  Mil Spec (Mil-S-53000) and a questionnaire are published (on TACOM's web site: http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm ) to gather industry input.  The Mil Spec is provided as a general guideline and w ill be updated and re-written as a performance based Purchase Description prior to Solicitation for Bids. At this point, three types of graders are being considered.  The grader types are divided according to their transportability requirements as follows. Type I  Non-sectionalized, C-130 Air Transportable and Air-droppable.  (Maximum weight 30,600 lbs.)   Type II  Sectionalized, C-130 Air Transportable and Air-droppable (See Type I).  Helicopter (CH-47) slingable in two loads.  (Maximum weight per load 16,644 lbs.) Type III  Non-sectionalized, C-130 Air Transportable and Air-droppable.  Helicopter (CH-47) slingable in one load.  (Maximum weight 16,644 lbs.) These new vehicles are intended to replace the Armys current fleet of aging Caterpillar Model 130G Motor Graders. The Grader must be diesel-engine driven, self-propelled, and capable of completing earthmoving tasks. These tasks include but are not limited to: coarse and fine grading, low and high bank sloping, flat and V-ditching, scarifying, and general construction and maintenance of roads.  If your company only produces one or two of the three types listed above, your response is still solicited.  Points of contact at TACOM for this survey are Jeff Calhoun 586-574-6556 or Bernard Sia 586-574-6101.

<DESC>Purpose of Request for Information (RFI):  United Space Alliance (USA), LLC, through its offices located in Cape Canaveral, Florida, is soliciting sources capable of providing the requirements described herein.  This acquisition is in support of USA’s prime contract NAS9-20000 - Space Flight Operations Contract (SFOC) with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Technical Requirements Description:  The NASA Space Shuttle Program (SSP) is proactively working to control risks in meeting program requirements brought on by test equipment failure & obsolescence.  USA plans to issue a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) to secure an emulated replacement solution for the VAX 8250 control system as used within the SURE (Shuttle Unit Revalidation Unit) test station at the NASA Shuttle Logistics Depot (NSLD).  The VAX 8250 interfaces to the SURE VME rack via the AEON card set installed in the VAXBI chassis (1 AEON card installed) and the VME rack (1 AEON card installed).  The SURE test set facilitates the troubleshooting, repair, & failure analysis of the Space Shuttle Orbiter PCMMU (Pulse Code Modulation Master Unit) & PDI (Payload Data Interleaver).  Analysis data, and SURE test set failure history indicate VAX 8250 hardware presents an unacceptable level of risk to the SSP in that prolonged VAX failure results in reduced capability to perform failure analysis on the PCMMU & PDI.  The objective of this upgrade is to provide the SSP an increased level of supportability concerning the SURE test set.  The VAX emulation solution hardware identified must be a design that is maintainable for 10 years minimum & utilize components that can be easily obtained and are currently available in production.  After completion of the emulation upgrade, a certification will be performed.  The certification will consist of validation testing of the SURE test set, acceptance testing of operational PCMMU and PDI LRUs, and acceptance test of both a PCMMU and PDI with faults inserted to verify proper error detection. Procurement Strategy:  USA is responsible for the overall program management and integration of these technical requirements.  USA will solicit the participation of qualified sources and sources desiring to participate on a limited basis will also be considered.  USA reserves the right to issue a single/sole source subcontract.	The period of performance and technical requirements are currently being defined for inclusion into a formal RFP package.  USA anticipates the issuance of a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) within 30 days of release of this RFI.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes, and the objective is:  (1) to invite potential sources to submit information that allows USA to conduct a technical assessment of capabilities and qualifications, and (2) to promote a best value competition.  This preliminary information does not constitute an RFP, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by USA to enter into a subcontract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications:  USA invites potential sources to submit a Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications document that will allow USA to conduct an assessment of capabilities and qualifications.	The Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications document shall be no more than five (5) pages (8.5” x 11”) in length.  The required information shall include, but not be limited to:  (1) A brief description of your company, including its size, major products, and primary customer focus, (2) A discussion of your company’s past experience and performance in developing/performing the requirements described herein, and (3) A brief description of your company’s facilities, assets and any other available resources.  This document may be submitted either in hard copy and/or electronically. Past experience will be identified by a listing of all related contracts and subcontracts, along with a description of your company’s performance under these contracts and subcontracts.  If any of these contracts and subcontracts are Government related, provide the Contracting Officer’s name and telephone number in order for USA to validate your statements.  To be considered as a viable source, USA will evaluate the Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications by considering, but not limited to, the following criteria:  (1) Depth and relevance of experience and past performance history, which convey a demonstrated technical, cost, schedule ability; (2) An understanding of the technical requirements and risks associated with this requirement; and (3) The adequacy and availability of necessary facilities and resources for implementing and performing the contractual work. USA reserves the right to request supplemental information in order to clarify your company’s capabilities and qualifications.  Only offerors deemed to be best qualified, or have a reasonable chance for award, will receive the RFP. Due to the nature of the technical requirements, firms interested in participating in this procurement are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Department of State International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and/or the U.S. Department of Commerce Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Firms interested in this procurement shall submit their Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications document no later than August 3, 2005 to the following address:	United Space Alliance, LLC (USA), 8550 Astronaut Boulevard, Cape Canaveral, Florida 32920, Attention:  Eddie Jarrell, Mail Code USK-360.  Questions regarding this procurement should be referred to Eddie Jarrell as follows (Telephone:  (321) 861-1158, Facsimile:  (321) 861-5243, E:mail:  Edgar.L.Jarrell@usa-spaceops.com).

The UTHSCSA has already developed a model evaluation process to analyze the programs along the U.S.-Mexico border that have increased the number of disadvantaged and minority students into health professions and improved women, infant, and child health, oral health, environmental, and public health.  In addition, the UTHSCSA has developed a database to enter the programmatic data.  For the past 14 years, they have work closely with the Health Careers Opportunity Program and Centers of Excellence Program grantees collecting baseline data on Hispanic students and faculty in health professions fields. These factors make the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio the only possible source for this contract.

<SUBJECT>A -- Control-Based Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking Program
<DESC>DARPA will host a Proposers’ Day Workshop in support of a Control-Based Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking program on August 30, 2005 at Crystal City Marriott, 1999 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA beginning at 8:30am and lasting until 5:00pm.  The purpose of this Conference is to provide information on the Control-Based Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking program, promote additional discussion on this topic, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

It is anticipated that a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the program will be released prior to the conference.  

The Control-Based Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (CBMANET) program will design, develop, and demonstrate a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) based on a tabula rasa rethinking of wireless network architecture inclusive of distributed adaptive control mechanisms, cross-layer protocols tailored for wireless tactical environments, and reformulated network layering abstractions as warranted.  The result will be a novel and advantageous MANET that dramatically improves performance from the end user’s perspective for at least the following three reasons.

First, a control-based network will more effectively allocate wireless network resources to meet user goals and operator constraints.  Ideally these goals and constraints will be explicitly characterized in the form of a dynamically tunable objective function that reflects the network designer/planner’s purpose and guides distributed cross-layer network adaptation.  Examples of relevant goals and operational constraints include aggregate application utility maximization, resource availability, fairness, connectivity, quality of service assurance, mission-adaptive multi-level precedence and priority, and the desired network operating regime concerning probability of jamming, intercept, or detection.

Second, novel protocols suitable for wireless networking will be employed independent of historical constraints motivated by today’s dominant networking paradigms.  In particular, the CBMANET protocols will exploit cross-layer interactions in order to more effectively support tactically relevant network applications.  Typical traffic loads are characterized by prioritized content, deadline-sensitive messaging, and a heavy emphasis on multicast.

Third, conventional network layering principles will be reconsidered to more effectively enable cross-layer interactions and to better modularize user concerns such as latency, capacity, energy, fairness, and priority.  The remodularized stack will provide interfaces and hooks tailored to support the distributed adaptive control mechanism in the spirit of “design for manageability”.  

DARPA anticipates that major BAA topic areas will include distributed adaptive network control (potentially drawing on advances in convex optimization, optimization decomposition, economically inspired algorithms, distributed constraint satisfaction, model finding, game theory, mechanism design, machine learning, cognitive systems, stigmergic and biologically inspired systems, and/or multiagent systems) as well as cross-layer network design (inclusive of information-theoretic innovations, jointly designed protocol sets, novel separations of concern, and the principled exposure of control and feedback parameters to enable effective distributed control).

DARPA anticipates that the early research focus will concern networking and network control algorithms and protocols rather than hardware and physical-layer concerns; however, proposals would be expected to highlight any relevant physical-layer dependencies and constraints.  In later phases, DARPA would anticipate a series of demonstrations and experiments with representative hardware using the algorithms and protocols developed in early phase(s).  Also, DARPA anticipates that the scope of the program will not extend to the design of security mechanisms; however, proposers would be expected to consider the security implications of their designs.

DARPA currently plans to solicit proposals for the full scope of the problem – an end-to-end system that is designed by a multidisciplinary research team with coordination and implementation support from an integrator.  DARPA may also accept more narrowly focused technology maturation proposals that have a potential to dramatically enhance the end-to-end systems. 

DARPA anticipates that the Control-Based Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking program will be supported with 6.2 funding, and that the project will be unclassified.

Material Conform to the following specifications: Use ASTM A588 unpainted weathering steel for the major superstructure components (girders, diaphragms, etc.) and ASTM A36 galvanized steel for the decking. Use fasteners and hardware consistent with the major metal components being joined. Use Coast Region Douglas Fir timber for the timber running surface. Ensure that all structural timber and lumber are seasoned and dried at the time of fabrication. Material that has become twisted, curved, or otherwise distorted prior to assembly into the final structure will be cause for rejection.
Design Features Provide a modular design that employs steel wide flange or plate girders as the main load carrying members. Design and fabricate the bridge such that the components may be assembled in the field with basic tools and skills. Make all field connections using high strength bolts. Furnish a bridge consisting of longitudinal sections joined along their edges to form the full width structure. Furnish all necessary bearing assemblies, anchor bolts, and connectors to fully assemble the bridges on concrete abutments. Furnish a bridge with a span length sufficient to meet the overall bridge length as indicated in the elevation view shown below. To facilitate shipping, handling, and erection, design and fabricate the bridge to be field spliced at the 1/3 and 2/3 span points. The minimum bridge width is 8.56 meters as indicated in the following diagrams. Furnish a metal transverse deck with a timber running surface as indicated on the bridge typical section drawing. Install the metal decking and timber running surface prior to shipping. Single runs of deck plank may be left loose to facilitate connecting metal deck sections at the longitudinal joints. Provide appropriate hardware to fasten these planks after the bridge is assembled
Future plans for this bridge include removing and discarding the timber running surface and paving with an asphalt-wearing surface. Provide a paving dam along the outside edge of the metal decking to contain the future asphalt-wearing surface. Rig main superstructure components with lifting devices to facilitate efficient installation of the bridge using equipment common to logging or construction operations. Place lifting devices so as not to interfere with traffic utilizing the structure, or make provisions to remove the lifting devices after the bridge is assembled in place. Submittal Requirements Prepare drawings as necessary to adequately fabricate the bridges. This includes, but is not limited to, bridge detail plans including girder and deck member dimensions, anchor bolt layouts, erection drawings or instructions. Include in the General Notes any relevant information necessary to perform an independent structural check of the design including design loads, material engineering properties, and any design assumptions. Furnish erection instructions including a full list of bridge components, hardware, and fasteners. Furnish four sets of drawings and one set of supporting calculations for acceptance before performing work covered by the drawings. If drawings are returned for revision, correct and resubmit for acceptance. Allow 14 days per submission. If drawings must be resubmitted, the time for acceptance starts over. Obtain prior written approval for changes or deviations from the accepted drawings. Limit drawings to a maximum size of 610 by 920 millimeters. Include on each drawing and calculation sheet, the project number, name, and other identification as shown in the contract. Alternatively, review drawings may be submitted in electronic format using AutoCAD, Micro-Station, or Acrobat file format. Final acceptance drawings (record set) and calculations shall bear the seal and signature of a professional engineer proficient in bridge design.
Design Criteria Design the bridges according to AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges, Seventeenth Edition, 2002, with Interim Specifications or AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, Third Edition, 2004. Use either AASHTO MS 22.5 (HS 25), or HL-93 for the design live load vehicle (according to the design method chosen). Provide for 75 mm future asphalt wearing surface in computing the dead loads. Design the bridge rails, rail posts, and connections using the full AASHTO loads as specified in either of the above listed design specifications.
Steel Fabrication Fabricate the structural steel in a fabricating plant that is certified in Sbr (Simple Steel Bridges), under the AISC Quality Certification Program. Perform welding and weld qualification tests according to the provisions of ANSI/AASHTO/AWS Bridge Welding Code D1.5.
Furnish a copy of all mill orders and certified mill test reports. Show on the mill test reports the chemical analyses and physical test results for each heat of steel used in the work. Furnish certified mill test reports and production certifications before the start of fabrication using material covered by these reports. Material may be furnished from stock, which can be identified, by heat number and mill test report. Do not drill, cut, or weld portions of structural members unless shown in the plans or approved in writing. Fabricate (mill, grind, or weld as shown on the approved plans or as specified) end bearing stiffeners for girders and stiffeners intended as supports for concentrated loads to provide full bearing on the flanges to which they transmit load or from which they receive load. Fabricate intermediate stiffeners not intended to support concentrated loads to provide a tight fit against the compression flange. Finish bearing and base plates and other bearing surfaces that will come in contact with each other or with concrete to the ANSI surface roughness defined in ANSI B46.1, Surface Roughness, Waviness and Lay, Part I, as shown in the following table.

ANSI Surface Roughness Values
Bearing Surface	Surface Roughness Value(µm)

Heavy plates in contact in shoes to be welded	25
Milled ends of compression members, milled or ground ends of stiffeners and fillers	13
Bridge rollers and rockers	6
Pins and pin holes	3
Sliding bearings	3

Punch or drill all bolt holes. (a) Punched holes.  Use a die diameter that is not more than 2 millimeters larger than the punch diameter. Ream holes that require enlarging to admit bolts. Clean cut the holes without torn or ragged edges. (b) Reamed or drilled holes.  Ream or drill holes so they are cylindrical and perpendicular to the member. Where practical, direct reamers by mechanical means. Remove burrs on the outside surfaces. Ream and drill with twist drills, twist reamers, or roto-broach cutters. Assemble and securely hold together connecting parts that are being reamed or drilled and match-mark before disassembling.(c) Accuracy of holes.  Holes not more than 1 millimeter larger in diameter than the true decimal equivalent of the nominal diameter of the drill or reamer are acceptable. The slightly conical hole resulting from punching operations is acceptable. (d) Accuracy of hole group after reaming.  After reaming, the maximum allowed offset of 85 percent of any contiguous group of holes through adjacent thickness of metal is 1 millimeter. Prior to shipping, mark each major component of the bridge superstructure with the same serial number. Ensure that the marking is permanent and clearly visible on each component, both when stacked in storage and when erected at a bridge site. Timber Fabrication Bore holes for round drift pins and dowels to the same diameter as the dowel or pin. Bore holes for square drift pins and dowels to a diameter equal to the side dimension of the pin or dowel. Bore holes for galvanized bolts to 3-millimeter larger than the diameter of the bolt.

<DESC>Combined synopsis/solicitation for Survival, Movement, and Spawning Distribution of Adult Salmonids in the North Fork Toutle River.

Background

There is a need to determine the migratory behavior, habitat use, and ultimate deposition of ESA-listed coho salmon and steelhead trout in the North Fork Toutle River watershed.  This information is needed to identify and implement effective recovery measures and thus contributes to the goals and objectives of the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund (PCSRF).

The North Fork Toutle River drains the east face of Mount St Helens to the Cowlitz River, a major tributary of the Columbia River in southwestern Washington.  In response to the 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) constructed a Sediment Retention Structure (SRS) on the North Fork Toutle River to reduce the transport of fine sediment to the lower watershed.  The SRS was built without fish passage facilities and currently presents a significant barrier to migrating adult salmonids.  To facilitate passage of adult salmonids to the upper watershed, a Fish Collection Facility (FCF) was constructed one-mile downstream of the SRS.  Adult steelhead trout and coho salmon collected at the FCF are transported above the SRS and released into Alder and Hoffstadt Creeks, which enter the North Fork 7 and 15 miles, respectively, above the SRS.  Approximately 100-150 steelhead and 300-400 coho salmon are trapped annually and transported to the upper North Fork – far below the number of fish that historically spawned in this area.  The post-release fate of these fish is unknown, but due to the stress of handling, the random assignment of fish to release locations, and less-than-optimal habitat conditions, we suspect that their survival and spawning success is poor.

Both coho salmon and steelhead are listed as threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, and the North Fork Toutle River populations have been identified as critical to ESU recovery in the Regional Recovery Plan released earlier this year by the Lower Columbia Fisheries Recovery Board.  

Work to be Accomplished

The first year of this project will involve the application of radiotelemetry and spatial analysis (GIS) techniques to determine the migratory behavior, habitat use, and post-release success of adult coho salmon and steelhead trout in the North Fork Toutle River watershed.  This study is intended to identify fish passage and habitat restoration options that will benefit all salmonid species found in the North Fork Toutle River.

In this project, we propose to capture naturally produced adult steelhead and coho at the existing FCF, to fit approximately 40 individuals of each species with radio transmitters, and to monitor their movement and survival following release at four locations:
 
1.	Immediately upstream of the FCF, but below the SRS;
2.	Immediately upstream of the SRS; 
3.	At the existing release location in Alder Creek, a tributary that enters the North Fork from the south approximately 7 miles upstream of the SRS; and
4.	At the existing release location in Hoffstadt Creek, a tributary that enters the North Fork from the north approximately 15 miles upstream of the SRS.  

Fish will be tagged over the entire migration season for each species to adequately represent adult returns to the upper watershed.  Adult steelhead (winter-run) in the North Fork Toutle River migrate from approximately December through April and spawn from March to early June.  Adult coho salmon are present in the North Fork from October through February.

The fish will be radiotracked using a combination of mobile and fixed receiver sites throughout the migration and spawning period.  Positions will be mapped and entered onto GIS coverages.  The pattern and timing of movements will be analyzed to determine spawning distributions, and passage and reproductive success.  The resulting information will enable managers to determine whether the SRS is a barrier to anadromous fish, to refine existing trap and haul operations or, if appropriate, to consider modifying the spillway to enable volitional passage by upstream-migrating fish.

Tasks

Funding is provided to contribute to the completion of the following tasks.

1.	Convene a 1-day workshop including agency personnel, scientists, tribal representatives and other interested parties to assess the current state of knowledge of juvenile and adult salmon migration and related environmental and management variables in the Toutle River system, and to develop a basic framework and identify appropriate measurement technologies and analyses.

2.	Develop a preliminary study plan identifying goals, objectives, experimental design, equipment and materials and submit for review and approval by appropriate agency personnel.

3.	Obtain the necessary information, equipment, and permits to conduct the study and equipment setup. 
 

4.	Implement the study beginning in September 2005; radiotracking will continue through the end of the steelhead spawning season (approximately June 15, 2006).

5.	Habitat mapping – Map spawning habitat use by coho and steelhead to estimate the relative amount of usable tributary and mainstem habitats above the SRS.

6.	Data Entry - Project data and information will be entered into the PCSRF database through the data portal upon commencement of the project and updated at least monthly as the project progresses.  Performance metrics and other final data will be entered into the PCSRF database at the time of the completion report or before July 30, 2006.

7.	Complete analysis of data and prepare a report that presents study findings and recommendations. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $50,000

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor’s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 05 August 2005, 10:00 A.M.
