Hoosier National Forest
Recommended Seed Mixture

For use at all locations and seasons:

Apply throughout the season when soil moisture conditions are adequate for germination.
Winter wheat is a nonnative annual agricultural (nurse) crop species, but it is non-persistent and a fast-growing, short-lived plant that provides quick soil stabilization to keep invasive weeds from invading without competing with native grasses/wildflowers.  Mix the winter wheat seed with the selected native seed species according to the rates displayed below:

		Species							Per Acre

	Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum)					40 lbs./acre
	Switch grass (Panicum virgatum)					  4 lbs./acre
	Virginia wild rye (Elymus virginicus)					  4 lbs./acre
	Partridge pea (Cassia fasciculata) – preferred – both districts	  1 lbs./acre
or Illinois bundle flower (Desmanthus illinoensis) – use only Tell City RD

This seed mix is for use in general applications across the Hoosier where ground disturbances have created conditions with the potential for soil erosion and the possible spread of nearby nonnative invasive plants.  Typically, areas requiring seeding may include roadsides, log landings, and firelines on steeper slopes.  Where necessary use a light covering of weed-free straw, if available, to help hold in moisture and increase germination.  Do not use field hay for mulch as it invariably contains innumerable weed seeds, and if weed-free straw is not available or it is visually questionable, then it is much better to not use any at all.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Air National Guard requires the following services at Bradley Air National Guard Base in East Granby, CT:  PROJECT: Construct an above ground junction box with protective shed on a concrete slab.  Reconnect existing wire located in the buried juction box (which consists of 15 conducits, each with 10 wires per conduit) into the new above ground junction box.  The Government is aware that some of the existing wiring is deteriorated and needs to be replaced.  The sucessful bidder will investigate the deterioration after award and provide a proposal to the Government for later negotiation of a possible contract modification to replace that wiring. REQUIREMENT: The existing electrical box is not compliant with the NEC as the incoming conduit is not at proper depth.  This box is a health hazard as it must be continually pumped out with a hand pump.  The box is improperly located.  The box should be elevated and placed in a proper NEMA enclosure. CURRENT SITUATION: The electrical junction box that ties in the issue strands with the MCC is located at the low point of a depression and it is continually filled with water that appears to be coming in through the conduit, in addition the wires are only protected by wire nuts and electrical tape so the junction box is always potentially energized.  Due to the numerous wires in the box, the potential for a system short exists.  The solicitation is 100% set-aside for participation by Service Disabled Veteran Owned businesses only.  Point of contact is Michael S. Mastalski at email: michael.mastalski@us.army.mil<BR>

FOHS&rsquo; Smoking Cessation and NRT Dissemination Program One of the varied services that are offered to federal agencies and their employees is FOHS&rsquo; smoking cessation program. The current annual voluntary participation in this program is approximately 1,500-2,000 clients. The goal of the smoking cessation program is provide clients with education and counseling, combined with the most appropriate nicotine replacement therapy in an attempt to eliminate this addiction. The following outlines the sequence involved in an interested individual enrolling in FOHS&rsquo; smoking cessation program. FOHS must have an interagency agreement in place with the employee&rsquo;s agency in order to enroll. Given the signed agreement and agency funding, the following sequence occurs: &bull; The client submits an eligibility form to sign up for the program with relevant contact information &bull; A FOHS trained staff initiates and conducts a counseling session with the federal employee that determines: o Appropriateness of NRT for use with federal employees, and if &ldquo;yes&rdquo; o Specific type and dosage of NRT that may be most efficacious o Information regarding where to send NRT is recorded o A &ldquo;quit plan&rdquo; is collaboratively developed &bull; The interview form containing the &ldquo;order&rdquo; for the NRT is forwarded to FOHS&rsquo; smoking cessation point of contact in Seattle, WA. This site currently maintains a supply of all NRT products. &bull; The NRT with a smoking cessation guide are shipped (via FED-EX) to either the individual recipient or FOHS OHC. &bull; FOH trained staff schedules a suitable date for a 6 Month Follow up call based on the client&rsquo;s quit date to determine program success.
