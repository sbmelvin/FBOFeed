Network-9 Contracting Office (NCO-9) and Robley Rex VA Medical Center is conducting market research for a Contractor to furnish board eligible and/or board certified Neurosurgeons and Orthopedic-Spine Surgeons to provide Ambulatory Care for beneficiaries of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Robley Rex VA Medical Center - Department of Surgery, 800 Zorn Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky 40206. The Statement of Objectives is to determine if a contractor can provided both board eligible and/or board certified Neurosurgeons and Orthopedic-Spine Surgeons to provide 24-hour/7-day a week (to include weekends and holidays) on-call/consultation services, on-site (at the Robley Rex VA Medical Center) clinic services (Monday through Friday during normal hours of operations), out-patient (OP) and in-patient (IP) surgical procedures at the Robley Rex VA Medical Center. The Government recognizes that in-patient (IP) surgical procedures that require sterotactic equipment, complex spine procedures which require instrumentation and/or special cases such as craniotomies will need to be performed at local hospital that has the required equipment and/or instrumentation. The Government would like to establish a firm-fixed-price contract hourly rate for all services done at the Robley Rex VA Medical Center to include on-call/consultation services. In addition, we are interested in how the industry would establish a firm-fix-price per procedure billing procedure for in-patient (IP) surgical procedures performed at local/regional hospital facilities located within 15-miles of the Robley Rex VA Medical Center and what are the appropriate Diagnosis-related Group (DRG) and/or the appropriate Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) for these procedures.

Understand that the healthcare industry surgical staffs are often independent contractors and/or sub-contractors that provide services at a surgical center, the predicament is how does a potential contractor structure price/cost schedule so all healthcare service providers utilized in the procedure and follow-on care until the in-patient (IP) can be transferred back to the VA Medical Center - your recommendations based on best practices on how to structure a firm-fix-price contract would be greatly appreciated.

The Bureau conducts over 170 surveys, censuses, and programs including closely watched economic indicators, annual demographic and economic statistics, and periodic comprehensive measures of most economic sectors including state and local government, as well as detailed geographic information about our Nation's population and housing stock.</p>
<p>One thing the past several decades has demonstrated is that the statistical agencies are ill equipped to truly understand what challenges data users face and how best to respond to these challenges. Changes to federal statistical sites have been modest, new technology is difficult to adopt, and sites are often organizationally-focused rather than reflecting customer needs.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is for the contractor to recommend opportunities for improving stakeholder awareness of Census Bureau data sets and programs, identify ways to educate and demonstrate the utility of Census statistics to key stakeholders, and suggesting ways to expand the user base and the usage of census information.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TASKS<br /><br /></span></strong>The Contractor shall:</p>

<p>&bull; Solicit input from key stakeholder groups including the business community, media, third party data providers, policy makers, trade associations, state and local users, as well as key census data user organizations.</p>
<p>&bull; Attend conferences of important stakeholders to solicit feedback regarding the "as is" environment as well as their ideas regarding web, data, and dissemination improvements.</p>
<p>2. Share insights and provide expertise related to a data user/stakeholder conference. <br />&bull;&nbsp; Provide advice&nbsp;on how a user/stakeholder conference can most effectively increase user awareness, demonstrate the utility of census information, and increase the customer base and the utility and usage of census data.</p>
<p>&bull; Submit a written assessment that will include an executive summary and supporting examples with recommendations&nbsp;no later than 90 days after award</p>
<p>&bull; Submit an outline documenting the specific objectives of the conference, a proposed agenda including possible content, suggestions regarding recommended participants and attendees, and options regarding the date and location of the conference. The agenda and related materials shall be delivered 60 days after the written assessment is approved.</p>
<p>3. Review and analyze materials, proposals, and tools related to improving stakeholder awareness, data usage and utility, or improving user education and feedback. <br /><br />The government anticipates awarding a contract using Part 15 Negotiated Competitive Procurement procedures.

This vendor is familiar with the current dissemination shortcomings from numerous discussions with stakeholder groups and user feedback.

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set-aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB), or for Small Businesses. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This is not a solicitation or offer. No contract or order will result from this announcement.</strong></span> Response by interested parties must be made by 9:00 am Pacific Time on March 28, 2014. The NAICS Code is 336611. The small business size standard is less than 1000 employees. The acquisition is for the Scheduled Dry-Dock Repairs of the USCGC HENRY BLAKE (WLM-563). The repairs will take place at the contractor's dry-dock. The performance period is anticipated to be from: August 13, 2014, through October 22, 2014 Seventy days (70).
<p>The HENRY BLAKE is 175 FOOT KEEPER CLASS COASTAL Buoy Tender</p>
<p>The Cutter's Home Port is: 2000 Marine View Drive, Everett, WA 98207</p>
<p>CUTTER DIMENSIONS: Minimum Depth of Water 15 feet, Minimum Height Clearance 59 feet.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTION:<br />USCGC HENRY BLAKE IS RESTRICTED TO THE STRAITS OF JUAN DE FUCA, AND PUGET SOUND. <br />JUSTIFICATION:<br />Sea keeping of the vessels requires a restriction for safety reasons. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Keeper Class (WLM) is a twin Z-drive tender that is not designed for open ocean transits. Along the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California North of San Francisco there are no reliable safe havens. Severe bar conditions between San Francisco Bay and Port Angeles make weather avoidance a safety concern. Similarly, a Gulf of Alaska transit would cause extremely dangerous stability conditions for the WLM's. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is one WLM per District and it is the best unit to safely maintain inshore ATON that cannot be serviced y larger WLBs due to close proximity of shoal water or smaller WLIs due to small crane and minimal deck space. Removing geographic restrictions would seriously impair each district's ability to conduct its ATON mission</span></strong></p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HUB Zone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by email to Jay.S.McReynolds@uscg.mil and include: (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers. At least two references are requested, but more are desirable. Your response is required by March 28, 2014 at 9:00 am PST. Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUB Zone set-aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUB Zone Set-Aside will apply which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern. Contractors are also reminded that should this acquisition become a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside will apply which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern. All of the above information must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUB Zone, Service disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside or Small Business Set-Aside. Failure to submit all information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUB Zone or SDVOSB Set-Aside, or Small Business Set-Aside will be posted in the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Please submit your questions via email to Jay McReynolds, Contract Specialist at Jay.S.McReynolds@uscg.mil</p>
