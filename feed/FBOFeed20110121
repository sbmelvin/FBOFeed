<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Arlington, Virginia, intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Wyle Information Systems, McLean, VA, to acquire commercial Information Technology services for the period 01 April 2011 to 30 June 2012, in support of DARPA's Support Services Office (SSO) Information Technology Services (ITS) modernization effort. The proposed contract action is for Information Technology services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". DARPA is moving to a new facility in 2012. The procurement is sole source to Wyle Information Systems because DARPA SSO/ITS requires a team of individuals that are familiar with the current DARPA IT environment and strategic plan in order to implement a new IT infrastructure for DARPA's new facility. The team will provide services to establish an IT infrastructure to include infrastructure designs/modifications, equipment and software procurement, migration of existing infrastructure, installation, certification and accreditation, and maintenance. The effort will improve current IT capabilities and limit the down time to the DARPA staff during the move. <br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Agency. Subcontracting opportunities may be available with the prime contractor, Wyle Information Systems. <br />Note: A separate competition for the performance of IT Services at DARPA is forthcoming. An RFP is expected to be released within the next 60 days. Wyle will be required to coordinate all actions during the modernization and migration of the IT infrastructure with the newly selected contractor.<br />

The applicable authority is 10 U.S.C.2304 (d) (B), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a] [2] [ii] [B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible sourc e an d no other supplies or services that will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), to negotiate/award a purchase order to DJK Scientific Inc., 939 AEC Drive, Wood Dale, IL,60191, for the purchase of an Wako Compact Screening Systems, Hornet-KL powered by Kalypsys, Inc.
<p>This requested system required for the TOX21 program to add to our existing high throughput robot systems currently in use by our researchers and will increase the cutting edge technologies not currently found on other potential supplier's equipment.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that DJK Scientific, Inc. is the sole distributer of the product and no other product will fulfill the Government's need. Additionally, parts and accessories must be compatible with existing equipment and there are no other procurement alternatives other than going back to the original manufacturer to secure these needed spare parts. There are no other vendors that can provide these plates as DJK/Wako does not distribute these items to other vendors for resale. This is a sole source procurement as this vendor does not distribute to other vendors; and NCGC cannot obtain similar parts from other vendors as the specifications will be different causing this unit the possibility of malfunctions and other system failures that would be extremely costly to our projects and the down time this could cause.</p>
<p>Product Description:<br />1. Qty-1000, Lids, Assays Kalypsys Style, Stainless Steel<br />2.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), to negotiate/award a purchase order to DJK Scientific Inc., 939 AEC Drive, Wood Dale, IL, 60191, for the purchase of an Wako Compact Screening Systems, Hornet- NX.
<p><br />The Laboratory of Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease (TRND), a branch of the NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), is requesting a 384/1536-Well Pintool, Model NX for low-volume, high precision liquid transfer. This instrument is needed to handle the existing protocols of compound library replication, dilution, and delivery to high-density format assays established by the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), a branch of the NCTT. The implementation of existing technology and protocols will ensure the highest levels of accuracy and experimental efficiency across all laboratories under the NCTT.</p>
<p><br />The Hornet NX pintool is a fully programmable workstation. The programming information (operation type, number of dips, etc.) is stored in files called methods. Methods can be started manually (by the operator) on the on-line and off-line pintool and automatically (by the dispatcher) on the on-line system. There are 3 nests on the pintool: Chilled nest (for controls), compound plate nest, and assay plate nest. The plate position has a locking nest for positioning and securing the plates during transfer operations. Two of the nests (assay plate and compound plate) have a pair of pneumatic actuators for positioning the plate in the X and Y axis. The assay nest uses vacuum to hold the plate down; an operator switchable (on/off) sensor can be used to verify that the plate has been accurately loaded on the nest. When the plate is correctly positioned, the bottom side of the outside edge of the plate rests on the pins and the actuator end effectors. The plate should be flat and loose when placed correctly. The third nest is a chilled, static nest. This plate is passive (it has no locking mechanism) and has a lid to minimize evaporation. The pinhead contains 1536 pins, each with 10nl slots. The pins float in a Teflon coated pintool head frame. They are unconstrained in the vertical axis and are held down only by gravity. The pin head can be easily removed and has manual adjustments for rotation around the z-axis and tilt (pitch and roll).</p>
<p><br />The sole source determination is based on the fact that DJK Scientific, Inc. is the sole distributer of the Wako Compact Screening Systems, Hornet- NX and no other product will fulfill the Government's need. Additionally, the Hornet NX pin transfer station is identical to the one used currently by the NCGC. This identical technology is needed to reproduce performance and protocol transfer between the laboratories within the NCTT. This additional unit will improve data consistency and quality, enabling a seamless transition of assays from the bench to the full automation between the laboratories of the NCTT. In order to maximize the technology available to NCTT staff, this additional unit will enable NCTT to replicate and duplicate existing protocols and will allow for the flexibility to use the exact same technology for all protocols if one unit becomes broken or is down due to routine repairs. Using this same technology will eliminate the introduction of costly new variables into the data and this factor will result in significant cost savings to NCTT terms of man hours and consumables costs.</p>

This is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for an award of a contract. The point of contact is Ms. Rene Brown, rene.brown@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>Contractor to provide a chartered ocean-going vessel and associated services in the Chukchi Sea for the USGS Alaska Science Center, Anchorage, AK. The USGS will conduct operations in the Chukchi Sea to tag and identify walrus species in the Arctic Regions. Any vessel capable of working in broken sea ice in support of these operations is sought. The approximate period of performance is middle July to early August 2011. The vessel will provide transportation and support for a science crew of nine USGS scientists. Operations will include deployment of small work boats allowing USGS personnel to attach satellite linked radio tags on walruses within the sea ice margin. Two USGS workboats will be used for the field work and must be loaded onto the vessel from a port with road access near Anchorage, AK. The work area is the Chukchi Sea at the southern end of the retreating pack ice, starting north of Point Hope, depending on sea ice conditions. The vessel will operate within the sea ice margin. The contractor's vessel must meet all current US Coast Guard (USCG) standards for an oceanographic research vessel for safe off shore operations in the Arctic Ocean. Name of vessel, proof of USCG license, proof of insurance, a description of the watercraft, and experience of the vessel's Captain are required. The vessel's Captain must demonstrate approximately three years experience operating large watercraft in the following specific regions, ice-bearing waters of the North Pacific and or Arctic Oceans. Vessel shall be made available for inspection before award. A Request for Quotation, G11PS00051, will be issued with an anticipated award date of May 15, 2011. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This procurement is a 100% set-a-side for small business.

<RESPDATE>012811
<CONTACT>Stewart Evans, Email sevans@usgs.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order for a Teledyne RD Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler to work in tandem with existing USGS owned Teledyne RD Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers. The RD Instruments' ADCP is the only known Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler that allows measurements of extended interval (20 minutes of 2 Hz measurements every hour) of higher frequency current measurements while also providing uninterrupted acquisition of shorter interval data (90 seconds of 1 Hz data every five minutes). The ability to simultaneously measure and store these two sampling requirements yields a unique data set from a single instrument that cannot be duplicated even with deployment of 2 separate current measuring instruments due to signal interference. Of interest is that the RD Instruments profiler is the only one of its kind made with a redundant four acoustic beam configuration, which is useful when one beam gets blocked or fails, and to evaluate the quality of the data. The four beam configuration also allows measurement of turbulence, which is not possible with three beam systems. Based on the above requirements, we intend to &iquest;negotiate on a sole source basis&iquest; with Teledyne RD Instruments. Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS requirement may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 2:00 PM PDT. All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Teledyne is the only known source to provide this unique equipment. Estimated delivery date is February 25, 2011. For further information, please contact the Contracting Specialist at (916) 278-9345 or kweske@usgs.gov.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), is seeking capability statements from Small Business organizations with capabilities to conduct a large national longitudinal cohort study and establish a regulatory-science framework to monitor the behavioral and health impacts of provisions in the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA).  The FSPTCA gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco-product advertising, labeling, marketing, constituents, ingredients and additives in the United States.  These regulatory changes are expected to influence tobacco-product risk perceptions, use patterns, and exposures, and to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality over time.  The study initially will focus on designing the sample, establishing the cohort, collecting data on a yearly basis, developing a database, arranging a central specimen repository, and measuring and reporting on the near-term behavioral and health effects of the regulatory changes.   NIDA anticipates that over time, the study will involve continued cohort monitoring, additional recruitment of young adults to the cohort at each wave, cross-sectional analyses within age groups and longitudinal data analysis, including analysis of distal outcomes, and small area estimation modeling.  Results from this study are expected to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of tobacco-product regulations in the United States (For detailed information on FSPTCA, see http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ031.111.pdf).<br><br>This is a SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of ALL small businesses (e.g., 8(a), Veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled Veteran-owned small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and other small businesses) having the in-house capability and multi-disciplinary knowledge, expertise, and experience required to: plan and execute large national longitudinal behavioral health studies with sufficient power to detect immediate and long-term outcomes with small-to-moderate effect sizes in the entire sample and in designated subgroups; develop, field test, and implement sample designs, assessment instruments, and data-collection protocols; ascertain and maintain locator information for participant tracking, retention, and follow up; collect, store, package, and ship bio-specimens for laboratory analysis and preservation in a specimen repository; organize and convene meetings with subject-matter experts and advisors with expertise in, among others, epidemiology, natural history, and  longitudinal cohort research, tobacco-related disease processes and clinical outcomes, and tobacco-product policies; collect and analyze economic, social, and geographic data to augment data collected from individuals on social contextual and other influences on individual behaviors; validate self-reported data on incident health outcomes with medical records-based information and through use of  multiple causes of death data from the National Death Index, the National Social Security death files, or the Division of Vital Records of state health departments; develop small-area estimation models; and produce clean ready datasets and documentation for each data-collection wave and the entire cohort.<br><br>Additionally, Small Businesses must have the capabilities and experience required to develop and submit study materials for the collection of information from more than nine individuals to the Office of Management and Budget for timely review and approval.<br><br>The established NAICS code is 541712.<br><br>In addition to demonstrating the above capabilities, information sent should be relevant and specific in the technical area under consideration on each of the following qualifications: 1) Experience: An outline of previous similar projects, specifically the techniques employed in the areas described above; 2) Personnel: Name; professional qualifications; specific experience in the work requested.

<a href="mailto:christie.honeycutt@va.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Description: 

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Beneficiary Travel (BT) Software Package, a component of Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). 

The BT Package is authorized by law and is codified in Title 38 USC  111.  Currently, the BT Package does not provide stakeholders with timely information nor does it adequately support VA's patient needs.  The requested features, capabilities, and enhancements will deploy new functionality in a defined series of iterations to better assist the field in meeting the intent of the law and regulation.  

Introduction: 

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  In accordance with FAR Part 10, Market Research, and as part of VA's market research process, this is a request for information (RFI) to assist us in developing an acquisition strategy for changes to the Beneficiary Travel Package. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the VA.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources able to meet VA requirements, to assist in planning possible future technical requirements, to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy, and to understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available. Telephone inquiries and responses will not be accepted at this time since there is no further information available.  This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification.  VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this RFI.  

Background: 

Included in the 'Requirements' section below are the changes to the Beneficiary Travel Package that are being requested by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Business Office.  The features, capabilities, and enhancements identified and described below are consolidated to meet regulatory changes of Public Law 111-163, The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010, which was signed into law by the President on May 5, 2010, as well enhancements to provide more accurate and less burdensome delivery of beneficiary travel benefit services to Veterans, better meet the reporting needs of the VA Central Office and field, and Congress, and reduces potential fraud, waste and abuse. 

Public Law 111-163, Section 305(f) requires VA to revise the VHA BT Package to accept allowance changes for travel based on mileage paid under Section 111(a) of Title 38, United States Code, which may exceed the cost of such travel by public transportation regardless of medical necessity. The BT enhancements will support the Under Secretary for Health, VHA Handbook 1601B.05, Beneficiary Travel, subparagraph 9a(1)(a), that is now revised to read: "Notwithstanding the regulations in Title 38 Code of Federal Regulations Part 70, an allowance for travel based on mileage may exceed the cost of such travel by public transportation regardless of medical necessity."

VHA is comprised of 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) that are each responsible for managing health care activities within their geographic area that can include six to ten medical facilities and a number of supporting outpatient facilities.  Details can be found at http://www.va.gov/directory/guide/division_flsh.asp?dnum=1. VA medical centers (VAMCs) (within a VISN) work together to provide efficient, accessible health care to Veterans in their areas.  With 163 VAMCs nationwide, VHA manages one of the largest health care systems in the United States.

The Beneficiary Travel Package of VistA provides the ability to perform the functions involved in issuing beneficiary travel pay. Travel reimbursement is provided to specified categories of eligible veterans. It is also provided to non-employee attendants who are eligible for such reimbursement. These attendants will be issued travel pay under the veteran's name. Payment for travel by special mode (ambulance, handicapped van, etc.) may be authorized if medically necessary and approved before travel begins, except in cases of medical emergency where delay would be hazardous to life or health.

For certain claims, the system will compute the amount payable from factors such as account type, parameter set-up of deductible amount per visit and per month, one-way or round-trip mileage, and applied costs.

Features:
"	Automatically computes the amount payable for claims with an account type of Compensation and Pension.
"	Allows each site to define and edit site-specific beneficiary travel parameters.
"	Produces a variety of statistical reports for a specified date range.
"	Provides the ability to reprint the standard pre-formatted beneficiary travel form for cash reimbursement.

VistA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at Veterans Health Administration facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VistA also includes the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing and future technologies.

Requirements:

VHA seeks enhancement to the Beneficiary Travel (BT) Package that is deployed nationwide.  The purpose is to improve the efficiency of certain business processes in its hospitals and clinics. The goals for BT enhancements are make the program more efficient and mitigate risk for detecting improper payments and implementing electronic authorization and payment.

Implement the following modifications and enhancements to the Beneficiary Travel software package:

1.	Beneficiary Travel Enhancement Needs - Iteration 1

a.	Incorporate a We-based application Dashboard that displays patient appointments, notes, orders, consults, and past claims.
b.	Calculate the driving mileage from the patient's address to a configured set of institutions.
c.	Automatically synchronize with travel claims as they are created in VistA using the BT claim menu.
d.	Provide an audit tool in the BT Dashboard to identify potential fraud, waste, and abuse.
e.	Develop an accounting method for Special Transportation Authorization and Special Transportation Vendor Billing.
f.	Provide local and national-level reporting and information sharing through an enterprise database with a common interface and reporting tool.
g.	Provide hard-coded and ad-hoc report and query capabilities.

2.	Beneficiary Travel Enhancement Needs  - Iteration 2 

The following are examples of the type of functionality enhancements required:
(This functionality builds upon the functionality in Iteration 1)

a.	Enhance determination of eligibility for BT deductible for regular (non- Compensation and Pension) visits to correctly take into account deductibles withheld at any VAMC during that calendar month rather than only at that particular facility.  
b.	Allow capture of deductible waiver fields and sharing of the fields/information with Electronic Service Record and to other sites of record, similar to Means Test (MT) hardship sharing.
c.	Authorized BT waivers should expire when the MT expires (or at the end of the calendar year in which it was granted). 
d.	Change financial amount used to determine a Veteran's eligibility for beneficiary travel to Total Household Income less Allowable Deductible Expenses. 
e.	Deductible waiver should automatically be set in VistA for Veterans who report income below the appropriate pension threshold.
f.	Automatically compute and ensure those Veterans meeting administrative criteria are noted as BT eligible and share the BT eligibility with all facilities where the veteran has received care.
g.	Enhance VistA to automatically complete/update the Veteran's beneficiary travel income certification when a MT or Rx copay test is completed/updated.  
h.	Automatically trigger and send changes to income/eligibility/address made in the VistA registration package to the BT package.  Automatically process and update Veteran information in the BT package with information received from the VistA Registration Package.
i.	Allow former Prisoner's of War and those Service Connected > 50% to complete a BT income screen.
j.	Automatically generate a denial of benefits statement and include the Veteran's due process rights.
k.	Add prompt to VistA for healthcare provider, "Does Veteran meet clinical criteria for Aid & Attendance or Housebound?".
l.	Implement a new threshold (Pension + Aid & Attendance) and allow for annual updates - on VistA and Enrollment System.
m.	Automatically determine eligibility for BT for Pension Veterans by using applicable Pension or Pension + Aid & Attendance rates.
n.	Changes to automated VA Form 70-3542d, Voucher for Cash Reimbursement of Beneficiary Travel Expenses - Reflect deductible changes: track number of trips (one way or round trip) and deductibles taken.
o.	Display BT indictor to reflect Veteran "BT Eligible for:" ALL or Service Connected only conditions and BT valid thru date, if applicable.
p.	System should allow for entry of current year test for MT hardship and BT waivers.
q.	Allow user to retrieve a specific income year in VistA when calculating BT travel benefits for entering a claim for a previous year.
r.	BT package should automatically electronically send vouchers for payment to Fiscal for processing, if the Veteran is not going to receive their BT pay at the time the BT request is processed.
s.	Add new field to the BT claim information screen to account for Bus Pass.

For the purpose of this RFI, "enterprise" is defined as deployment within one or more VISNs.  Solutions to be considered shall include: application software and all necessary hardware (servers).

These critical programs represent VHA's roles as a payer in the health care industry, while also augmenting our role as a key provider of health care services for Veterans and their beneficiaries.  The Purchased Care Business Line (PCBL) manages VHA's only health care benefit programs delivering services to spouses and dependents of certain Veterans - CHAMPVA, Spina Bifida (SB) and Children of Women Vietnam Veterans (CWVV). In addition, PCBL manages and oversees numerous Veteran focused programs including the traditional Non-VA (Fee Basis) Program, the State Home Per Diem Program and the Foreign Medical Program (FMP). These joint programs provide health care services to 1.5M covered lives and FY10 expenditures greater than $6B.

As with all health care payer programs, standardization of business practices is critical to efficient and cost effective operations. In addition, strong attention to managing improper payments, fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) and equity in benefit decisions across programs is key to appropriate outcomes for both beneficiary satisfaction and assuring stewardship of public funds.  
Within the PCBL, there has been a wide variation in the level of standardization in each of these component areas. At present, the CHAMPVA, SB and FMP programs have a centralized structure, affording PCBL the opportunity to apply standardized decision capabilities, strong program integrity activities and industry standard tools to assure rigorous management of financial controls. These programs are supported by a significant staff knowledge base of managing health care payer programs, affording PCBL and the CBO with a strong cadre of corporate expertise.  

These same programmatic controls have not been applied across other PCBL programs, in particular the Non-VA and State Home Per Diem Programs. This is due in part to the decentralized nature of those programs. The decentralization does not preclude PCBL from aggressively pursuing program improvement activities for these critical programs. In addition, due to the current organizational structure within PCBL, there is duplication of activities inherent in maintaining segregated functions such as policy sections devoted to each program area (this is one example of duplication of activities). It is critical that the PCBL take aggressive actions to resolve these variations in our programmatic delivery while building on the excellent historical knowledge base and expertise within the business line and assuring that all programs benefit from the application of these standards. 

Stages are envisioned for the overall change of the organization.  The initial is realignment of corporate management and work functions.  The longer term and later phases are expected to address the activities outside of the corporate structure.

Key components of the organizational change include:

o	Build on current expertise in the health care payer community
o	Cohort like functions to assure the most effective operations
o	Decrease variation in program administration
o	Utilize common payment tool sets to assure transparency across programs and maximize fraud/waste/abuse opportunities
The work of the consultant(s) is intended to:

o	Conduct an organizational scan and assessment or the readiness for change
o	Review of existing change management work teams, their structure and their existing plans and provision of expert advice for enhancements to these
o	Coaching and training of VA management and staff for effectively implementing the changes and successfully restructuring the organization
o	Assistance and guidance with project planning to guide the reorganization
o	Assistance and guidance with communications planning, development and execution

The following questions are posed in order to obtain needed knowledge of the services available from consulting agencies experienced with assisting organizations with major internal realignment.

1.	What is your company background, experience , and capability with organizational change management? Please provide a brief narrative no longer than on page in length.
2.	Much work is underway with work teams defined for change management, communications, implementation, impact analysis, and metrics development/measurement.   However, validation of the existing effort is needed along with coaching and advisement to insure maximum effectiveness of these teams.  Is this requirement consistent with industry practices?
3.	What factors go into the determination of how many and what types of consulting resources are necessary for an organization change such as described?
4.	What are the key elements/requirements that our office should request to be certain we get the right services and contractual arrangement in place?

8.0	SUBMISSION INFORMATION REQUIRED

POC Selection Process:  Katherine Volpe, Contracting Officer, 707-562-8399; 
POC Scope: Warren Yip, Project Manager, 707-562-8423.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, is seeking interested firms that are classified under one or more of the following small business programs: (1) Section 8(a), (2) HUB Zone, (3) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), (4) Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), (5) Service-Disabled Veterans-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and/or (6) Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB). The interested firms shall be architects or architect/engineer firms with experience in the planning and design of renovating hospitals, large medical and significant outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, or similar complex healthcare projects and capable of preparing all design and construction documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning, site development, utility infrastructure design, local utility approval, architecture, medical planning, civil engineering, structural engineering including seismic design, mechanical engineering, historic preservation, environmental protection, communication and data engineering, electrical engineering, interior design, landscape design, commissioning, construction cost estimating and market research, parking and traffic studies, and geotechnical investigation and surveying.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 541310.

Scope:
This project proposes to demolish Building 12 and construct a new, state-of-the-art medical facility at an expanded size of 75,000 gross square feet (GSF) at the San Francisco VA Medical Center (SFVAMC). The project also proposes to seismically retrofit Buildings 1, 6 and 8 to correct potentially hazardous facility, seismic, life safety and infrastructure deficiencies. As part of this project, research program space will be transferred from Buildings 1 and 6 to the new, replacement Building 12. Building 1 will be renovated to house clinical office space in order to allow decompression of Building 203, the main hospital, and Building 200, the main ambulatory care support building. Building 6 will retain administrative services, while Building 8 will retain ambulatory mental health and research functions. Finally, 250 additional parking spaces will be provided to reduce the current 750-space deficiency at SFVAMC.

Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8).  Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, along with water and energy efficiencies in design; and, in addition, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems will meet current codes and standards.  All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA's criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities.  The space will be in compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and PG-18-13 in all areas.  Required services will include preparation of schematics and design development plans, including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost.

At this time it is anticipated that the seismic retrofits of Buildings 1, 6, 8 and the Building 12 Replacement design will follow the design-bid-build delivery method and Site Utility design will follow the design-build delivery method.  Once a thorough analysis of the user's and the facility's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different design delivery method.

The contract may include options for: design development documents, construction documents, construction period services, site visits, and other professional services.

The completed project will be required to be LEED Silver certified.  Renewable energy systems will be required as part of this project.

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed will be considered.  Additional tasks may include site analysis and campus master plan.  Emphasis will be placed on cost and scope management capabilities and previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the proposed Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures.   In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.  All VA design guides and requirements can be found online at:  http://www.cfm.va.gov/TIL/. 

In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction.

Applicants must have an established working office within 50 miles of San Francisco, California and be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work, and be licensed in the State of California.  Preference will be given to firms with working offices capable of performing all design work within 50 miles of the San Francisco VA Medical Center, 4150 Clement Street, San Francisco, California  94121.  Office site visits to verify location and capacity may be performed.

All interested firms responses should include the following information: 1. Company Name, 2. Address, 3. Point of Contact, 4. Phone number and e-mail address, 5. Business size determination and qualifying Small Business status, 6. Certification of Small business Status, 7. Provide three to five examples of design experience with projects of similar size and complexity with the prime contractor performing the role of Architect of Record. Please limit responses to ten pages.  Responses are required by 1:00 p.m. (PDT) on 4 February 2011 by email to:  katherine.volpe@va.gov.

For questions regarding scope, please call Warren Yip on 707-562-8423.  For questions regarding contracting or the selection process, please call Katherine Volpe on 707-562-8399.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to extend services.  This action will result in a modification to the current contract, F04684-03-C-0050 with InDyne, Inc., 11800 Sunrise Valley Dr, Ste 250, Reston, VA for a period of sixteen (16) months.  The period of performance for this extension will be from 1 Oct 2011 through 31 Jan 2013.  This extension is needed to satisfy the WROCI requirement until the award of the Launch & Test Range Systems Integrated Support Contract (LISC), solicitation #09-49, can be completed.  The LISC combines three current contracts:  WROCI, Eastern Range Technical Services (ERTS) and Space Lift Range Systems (SLRS).   

The WROCI contract provides Western Range operations and maintenance; support services; training; command, control, communications, information and computer systems services; testing, modifying and installing communications, electronic and security systems at launch facilities, launch control centers test facilities and all 14 AF alarmed facilities located in Bldgs 10577 and 8401.  This effort provides network equipment and software maintenance, and direct customer support for user access to, and information transfer, over the Non-Classified internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), Local Area Network (LAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN) to the US Air Force, 30th Space Wing (30 SW) Western Range (WR) and launch agencies by providing qualified personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, specialized test equipment, supervision, and other items and services as necessary.  The WROCI requires an innovative, integrated, flexible and effective management approach and the contractor must provide technical support in a planned and coordinated manner which will ensure essential Western Range support systems are ready to support user requirements, and cause no impact to Range program schedules due to equipment degradation, failures, system problems or reprioritization of program requirements.  The wide variety of support systems involves careful workload planning and scheduling of resources to identify and resolve technical systems problems.  The contractor will be required to maintain and operate Department of Defense (DoD) computers, radios, communication centers, voice and data switching, and common-user telephone systems, interface with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and assess the impact of integrating new Communication systems into the WR and base-wide infrastructure.  The contractor will be required to operate the Network Control Center (NCC) and perform site observation, security services, operate sensitive unclassified destruct facility, and escort and data courier services as defined in this statement of work.  The WR encompasses a geographical area extending from the US West Coast to the Indian Ocean.  Instrumentation sites are located at VAFB, other California coastal sites.  Mobile instrumentation and measurement resources are deployed to other ranges, centers, and laboratories to meet Range customer requirements.  The WR receives and provides Range support to and from various agencies, to include but not limited to, the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Pacific Missile Range Facility, NASA Space Centers, 45th Space Wing (45 SW), 452nd Flight Test Squadron (452nd FTS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), North American Aerospace Defense Command, US Space Command (USSPACECOM), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), US Coast Guard, Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), and Reagan Test Site (RTS).  The 30 SW is responsible for providing Range capability to conduct and support activities for spacelift, ballistic missile, and aeronautical programs.  The WR is part of the Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) and supports DoD, NASA, commercial, and other user launch, orbital tracking, and test programs.  

The extension will provide for the continuation of uninterrupted services of the Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) operations described above.  This sixteen-month extension of services is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.    This extension of services will extend the end date of the period of performance from 30 Sep 2011 to 31 Jan 2013.  This extension of services will further allow for the future competitive procurement for these services under the LISC to be accomplished and allow for a transition of services to a potential new contractor.  InDyne, Inc. is the only responsible offeror for extension of these services, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement specific to this extension of services.  The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension.  A determination by the Government to extend these services and not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to extend these services.  Any responses to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to Shirley Castillo at shirley.castillo@vandenberg.af.mil and Claudia Boga at claudia.boga@vandenberg.af.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source basis with Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC), 140 Kendrick Street, Ste C120, Needham, MA 02494-2714.
<p>This requirement is for software support, upgrades, and license renewal of PTC Creo Elements software (formerly named CoCreate) at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR). The NIST Center for Neutron Research is responsible for the design, construction and operation of the current instruments as well as new instruments. Their development plays a key role in the success of the neutron facility. Designing new instruments and upgrading existing instruments has been a major task undertaken by the staff of the Center for Neutron Research using a network of PC based computer aided design (CAD) workstations running Creo Elements (CoCreate) Modeling and Annotation software. Since 1985 the Center for Neutron Research has generated a substantial quality of instrument and facility computer models (3D solids created with CoCreate Modeling) and drawings (2D shop drawings created with CoCreate Annotation) that form the basis for new or upgraded instrument designs. The Creo Elements (CoCreate) Software package is the only software package that offers acceptable upward and downward compatibility with existing and future instrument designs. Since there is no other known vendor that can supply compatible software support (maintenance, upgrades, and licenses) with PTC's proprietary software, the Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that clearly and unambiguously demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to provide the required licenses renewal. Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the C3 Ombudsman at:</p>

<p>C3 PROVISION 952.233-0001 C3 AGENCY PROTEST PROGRAM (NOV 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This solicitation may be protested to the issuing Contracting Office for decision by the Contracting Officer or by the Chief of the Regional Contracting Center if authority has been withheld. If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)/Senior Contracting Official (SCO) in accordance with FAR 33.103. A protest to C3 is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The C3 Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within C3, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.<br />(b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the C3 Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by C3. Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following:<br />(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.<br />(2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.<br />(3) An award or proposed award of the contract.<br />(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.<br />(c) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (f) of this provision for resolution of protests.<br />(d) For the purpose of filing a C3 Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. <br />(e) An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer.<br />(f) C3 Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from regina.daniels@afghan.swa.army.mil.</p>
<p>INVOICE INSTRUCTIONS<br />Submit invoices to regina.daniels@afghan.swa.army.mil.<br />The Contracting Officer has the right to request invoice at any time. In order to be proper, an invoice must include, as applicable the following:<br />(a) invoice date<br />(b) name of contractor<br />(c) purchase/delivery order number, line item number, description of supplies or services, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended total <br />(d) requisition number or document number<br />(e) date of shipment/delivery<br />(f) where practical, total, phone number and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice and<br />(g) discount terms.<br />Vendors must show prepaid shipping charges as a separate item on the invoice and will retain evidence of payment separately for a period of three (3) years. Such evidence will be furnished to the Government when required for audit purposes. Line items must be fully completed before authorization for payment can be made. <br />FOB Sharana is not equipped to utilize Wide Area Work Flow at this time.<br />(End of Instructions)</p>

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 9pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: red">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Past Performance (Past Performance significantly more important than price)</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paragraph (b) and (c) below do not apply for this acquisition</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

If quotes are hand delivered, delivery shall be made on the actual due date through Gate A, and a 48 hour (excluding weekends and holidays) prior notice shall be provided to Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist on 301-975-8448.</p>
<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-1, Quotation Preparation Instructions</p>
<p>1) Price Quotation: The offeror shall submit an original and one copy of the completed price schedule. If the quotation is submitted electronically, additional copies are not required. The pricing quotation shall be separate from any other portion of the quotation. The offeror should propose a firm-fixed-price, FOB Destination, for each CLIN. Contractor shall state express warranty coverage. Price quotations shall remain valid for a period of 90 days from the date quotations are due.<br />2) Technical Quotation: The offeror shall submit an original and one copy of the technical quotation. If the quotation is submitted electronically, additional copies are not required. The technical quotation shall address the following: <br />Technical Capability: The offeror shall submit a technical description or product literature for the equipment it is proposing, which clearly identifies the manufacturer, make and model. The offeror must demonstrate that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds each minimum requirement described in the statement of work by providing a citation to the relevant section of its technical description or product literature. If applicable, evidence that the Offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to provide the item(s) in the quotation should be included. The Offerors shall acknowledge that NIST will not store the equipment onsite before it is installed.</p>
<p>Accuracy: It be demonstrated with performance data, such that a 1 point performance evaluation can be demonstrated to be sufficient to achieve 1 standard deviation (SD) or better accuracy (defined below) for a 2 year period with maximum consumption of one standard-sized tank or less of a performance evaluation gas.</p>
<p>The preferred demonstration method requires a minimum of two reference gases. Both reference gases must satisfy the requirements given below for gas concentration standards. For performance evaluation/demonstration purposes, one reference gas may be designated as the calibration standard and one as the observation gas. The concentration of the observation or test gas should be chosen to have long term concentration stability as demonstrated by an independent method. (A second gas satisfying similar requirements to those of the calibration standard but having a different concentration within the instrumental range is acceptable.)</p>
<p>Instrument recalibration using the calibration gas may occur at daily or longer intervals. Longer intervals for recalibration are advantageous from the standpoint of calibration gas consumption.</p>
<p>In addition, the instruments must be demonstrated to be robust to fluctuations in their operating environment and ambient atmospheric conditions, including water vapor concentration fluctuations in the test gas. The preferred method of demonstrating robustness to ambient conditions is field operations for 1 to 2 years, with demonstrated combined measurement uncertainty at the 95% confidence level as determined by an independent, established measurement system (e.g., NOAA Global Monitoring Division tall tower continuous or flask-based measurements).</p>
<p>Alternative demonstrations of long-term accuracy will be considered if they can show the ability of the instruments to create a long-term regional measurement network with post-calibration combined uncertainty across the network of 1 SD or less.</p>
<p>Gas Concentration Standards: A clearly documented and immediate path of traceability of measurement results to U.S. national gas concentration standards, traceability to NIST, or to gas concentration standards provided by the Global Monitoring Division, Earth Systems Research Laboratory, NOAA, Boulder, CO.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>
<p>Acceptance of Terms and Conditions: This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein. The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p>QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>The use of calibration gases to achieve the accuracy requirements required is not acceptable for the purposed of determining the accuracy of measurements.</p>
<p>Instrument recalibration using the calibration gas may occur at daily or longer intervals. Longer intervals for recalibration are advantageous from the standpoint of calibration gas consumption.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Price: The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Past Performance and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339113 and the size standard in number of employees is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) to negotiate and award an order to OpGen Inc., 708 Quince Orchard Road, Suite 160, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878-1789 to procure OpGens Argus Optical Mapping System.

The sole source determination is based on the fact the National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis.  The Argus Optical Mapping System is a necessary instrument used to preview the microbial genomes of interest to determine the best targets for sequencing as well as generate the optical maps to order contigs, close gaps, correct misassemblies and detect repetitive sequences. OpGens Argus Optical Mapping System is a powerful, unique platform for automated, microbial whole genome analysis. This de novo Optical Mapping Technology generates high-resolution, ordered whole microbial genome maps from single microbial DNA molecules with no requirements for previous sequence information. This instrument is capable of many applications that include comparative genomics, whole genome assembly strain typing and characterization and clustering which is beneficial to NHGRIs Human Skin Microbiome Project. 

Optical Mapping is a proprietary technology and is unique in that it employs a process of stretching and immobilizing high molecular weight DNA across a linear surface which the DNA molecules are cut by restriction enzymes. The DNA molecules are then cut by restriction enzymes. The discrete DNA fragments are stained and relative fluorescence estimates the DNA fragment size and location. Proprietary software then assembles the fragments to form a consensus Optical Map of the entire genome. No other technology generates high-resolution, ordered, whole genome restriction maps. The technology is protected by at least 15 patents and patent applications.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation number is NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-077-DLM and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). 

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-47 (January 12, 2011).  

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the size standard in number of employees is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) and the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease program (TRND) a branch of the NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), to negotiate and award an order to GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp, 800 Centennial Avenue, Piscataway, New Jersey 08855-1327 to procure GEs INCA2000 System/Cell Analyzer.

The sole source determination is based on the fact the National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives. The Laboratory of Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease (TRND), a branch of the NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), in requesting this to handle the existing protocols of high-density format assays.  This implementation of existing technology and protocols will ensure the highest levels of accuracy and experimental efficiency across all laboratories under the NCTT. This requested imaging system is also needed to facilitate a streamline transition in assay transfer and development between TRND and the NCGC laboratory. The TRND laboratory will work as a collaborative resource for drug development using existing and novel cell based assays, animal studies, and ultimately support of human clinical trials. This imaging system will be used for a wide variety of applications with capabilities of using existing protocols as well as newly established protocols. The procurement of this equipment is imperative in order to be compatible with existing NCGC units. The data and protocols used in screening processes are dependent on the functionality of the existing InCell imaging system. At the NCGC the existing InCell system has been in heavy use for the past five years and has needed limited service due to malfunctions so this technology has been extremely well tested and has been proven to be reliable. Furthermore, existing protocols can be readily transferred from the new instrument. This will save us valuable time and resources needed to develop new protocols. Parts and accessories must be compatible with this existing technology in order to avoid the introduction of new variables into our ongoing projects. The GE INCell 2000 has the capability to measure subcellular distributions of proteins and cellular phenotypes from fluorescently labeled proteins or cellular organelles, DNA and other cellular constituents.  These measurements are fundamental to the development and characterization of cell-based phenotypic assays.

BACKGROUNDThe Bechler Ranger (Soldier) Station was established in 1910 in a remote outpost that was occupied by the US Army to help curb the growing threat of illegal hunting in the park. The Ranger Station is located in the most remote location within the lower 48 United States. Today the National Park Service (NPS) operates the facility from May until November (due to the severity of the winters). It functions as a public contact area for hikers, backpackers, fishermen and tour groups. Approximately six rangers reside at the facility during the summer season.
SCOPE OF WORK Currently, the NPS facilities depend on a 20 KW propane generator to supply all electrical requirements. The generator operates 24 hours a day from early May until late October. The generator powers a large well pump for supplying potable water for employees and visitors as well as providing water for the fire suppression system. Additionally, all employee residences and a public contact station are powered by the generator. In the past, the park examined the feasibility of installing a photovoltaic system that would reduce the dependency of the propane generator. Due to the severe winter months, it was realized that the batteries would have to be removed from the area every fall and re-installed every spring.  The permanently installed solar panels would be subjected to very heavy snow loads (up to 10ft) and would also have to be disconnected every fall. As a result, it was determined that a permanent photovoltaic system would not be practical.
Through technological advances, various companies now produce state-of-art photovoltaic systems that are portable. The solar panels are mounted on the roof of an enclosed trailer that houses the battery bank; all switch gear, DC/AC inverter and a high efficiency backup propane generator. This application would be ideal for the Bechler Ranger Station, as the trailer would be moved out of the area during the winter months and used in different areas of the park where winters are not as severe. It is anticipated that the trailer unit will provide over 80% renewable energy for the Bechler complex. This will result in an estimated reduction of over 21 metric tons of green house gases, annually.
Over 5,000 visitors enjoy the Bechler area every summer; hence the park will have a tremendous opportunity to inform/educate visitors on the environmental attributes of producing electricity from the sun. It is envisioned that this project will serve as a model for other remote sites within Yellowstone NP and other national parks within the United States. Lastly, the trailer will be used during the winter months in a variety of venues throughout the Yellowstone region that will result in high visibility benefits. This will include special park headquarters events, traveling to various high schools and universities within Montana, Idaho and Wyoming and regional gateway community functions.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted solicitation. Award will be made to the offeror proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability (capability of the item offered to meet the agency need), price, delivery, and past performance. As ratings become more equal among offerors, price may become the deciding factor.

P/N: 019858-000; BATTERY CELL; QTY: 150 EA; NSN: 6140 01 HS1 8805 (2.) P/N: DHS613-211.23; UNION; QTY: 700 EA; NSN: 4730 14 342 4537 (3.)

Newly-manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

Alternate parts must satisfy all form,<br />fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard SRR aircraft. All parts shall be NEW approved parts. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to a manufacturer, manufacturer's COC, FAA 8130, and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered products back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>C3 PROVISION 952.233-0001 C3 AGENCY PROTEST PROGRAM (NOV 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This solicitation may be protested to the issuing Contracting Office for decision by the Contracting Officer or by the Chief of the Regional Contracting Center if authority has been withheld. If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)/Senior Contracting Official (SCO) in accordance with FAR 33.103. A protest to C3 is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The C3 Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within C3, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.

<DESC>THIS ORDER WAS AMENDED TO ADD: THIS IS SET-ASIDE FOR A SMALL BUSINESS.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation number is NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-082-DLM and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). 

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-47 (January 12, 2011). 

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339113 and the size standard in number of employees is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) to negotiate and award an order to OpGen Inc., 708 Quince Orchard Road, Suite 160, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878-1789 to procure OpGens Argus Optical Mapping System.

The sole source determination is based on the fact the National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The NIH Intramural Sequencing Center is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis.  The Argus Optical Mapping System is a necessary instrument used to preview the microbial genomes of interest to determine the best targets for sequencing as well as generate the optical maps to order contigs, close gaps, correct misassemblies and detect repetitive sequences. OpGens Argus Optical Mapping System is a powerful, unique platform for automated, microbial whole genome analysis. This de novo Optical Mapping Technology generates high-resolution, ordered whole microbial genome maps from single microbial DNA molecules with no requirements for previous sequence information. This instrument is capable of many applications that include comparative genomics, whole genome assembly strain typing and characterization and clustering which is beneficial to NHGRIs Human Skin Microbiome Project. 

Optical Mapping is a proprietary technology and is unique in that it employs a process of stretching and immobilizing high molecular weight DNA across a linear surface which the DNA molecules are cut by restriction enzymes. The DNA molecules are then cut by restriction enzymes. The discrete DNA fragments are stained and relative fluorescence estimates the DNA fragment size and location. Proprietary software then assembles the fragments to form a consensus Optical Map of the entire genome. No other technology generates high-resolution, ordered, whole genome restriction maps. The technology is protected by at least 15 patents and patent applications. 

Contractor Requirements:

  The Contractor will deliver equipment within 30 days of receipt of order.
  The Optical Mapping System will generate whole microbial genome.
  The Optical Mapping System does not need previous sequence information to orient and   align contigs and identify misassemblies. 
  The Optical Mapping System provides a comprehensive view of the entire genomic architecture.
  The Optical Mapping System does not need amplification, PCR, cloning, paired-end libraries, pure isolates or genomic specific reagents to investigate microbial structure and function. 
  The Optical Mapping System will incur no risk of cross-contamination between samples.

Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:

  Upon arrival of equipment to destination, the package must be undamaged.
  For installation of equipment, all parts including computer must be functional and running in proper order.

FAR Provisions which apply to this acquisition are:1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (JUN 2008) 2) As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Commercial Items; 3) FAR Clause 52.212-4, (SEPT 2009) Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; and 4) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions.

<p>E.7 FAR Clause 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)(Tailored)</p>
<p>The Government will award up to three (3) contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors' whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Approach</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1 - Proposed technical approach supports PWS requirements.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2 - Use of industry standard and/or non-proprietary tools.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2 - Management Approach</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1 - Management organization and business model.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2 - Proposed organizational structure and staffing.</p>

Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />E.8 EVALUATION CRITERIA AND RELEVANT IMPORTANCE <br />The following criteria will be used in the evaluation of proposals:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors<br />Factor 1: Technical Approach.</p>
<p>The Technical Proposal should address each work area in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the performance work statement, including development/enhancement and operations and maintenance activities. General statements that the offeror understands, can, or will perform the listed functions without supporting information/narrative are inadequate. Paraphrasing the PWS or parts thereof, is similarly inadequate, as are phrases such as "standard procedures will be employed" or "well-known techniques will be used." This section shall be written to enable evaluators to make a thorough evaluation as to whether the services offered adequately respond to the specific Government requirements. The Technical Proposal shall clearly delineate the division of performance between the prime Contractor and the first-tier Subcontractor(s), if applicable. The offeror's technical approach shall address the sub-factors listed below:<br /><br />Sub-Factor 1: Proposed technical approach supports PWS requirements. Offerors shall describe, in detail, the proposed technical approach for addressing the PWS requirements in their response. The offeror's proposal should also demonstrate their ability to protect the Coast Guard systems and the integrity and the confidentiality of the information contained within them. It is essential to the Coast Guard that protection of the infrastructure is met in order to meet mission-critical objectives. Offerors shall include a narrative discussion of their efficiencies and unique aspects of the technical approach. The proposal should include discussion of knowledge, experience and applied use of industry best practices. The offeror's technical approach should address the strategy for evaluating and recommending new and emerging technologies; hardware and software products related to security; the development of effective IT security guidance and policies that reduces the Coast Guard's vulnerabilities to cyber threats. The proposal should address the strategy for providing technical, administrative, and management security assistance as it relates to IT security incidents; Certification and Accreditation Support for sensitive and unclassified (SBU) Systems and Classified (C-LAN Systems across Coast Guard) systems; assistance in developing IA awareness and Information System Security training programs and TEMPEST support. The offeror's technical approach should address these strategies to support DHS, DOD, USCG missions and IT security operations. The offeror's proposal shall clearly demonstrate a sound approach to, and alignment with, the DHS 4300a and USCG COMDINST 5300.13b Information Assurance Manual as well as CJCSM 6510.01A Information Assurance (Ia) And Computer Network Defense (CND)Volume I (Incident Handling Program); DoD Instruction 8500.2, Information Assurance (IA) Implementation. &amp; DoD Instruction 8500.1, Information Assurance (IA) Manual.</p>

<p>Factor 2: Management Approach.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offerors's Management Approach/Plan for the purposes of determining how well their management plan demonstrates its ability to sustain adequate resources throughout the life of the IDIQ that will be needed to successfully meet all of the PWS requirements (see Attachment I). The management approach proposed by the Offeror is critical to the success of this effort. Therefore, the management approach must be explicitly explained and presented in the proposal so as to provide the USCG with a complete description of how the effort will be managed. The management approach shall clearly describe a complete understanding by task of the required actions, anticipated workload, labor needs by type, by providing resumes that outline relevant skills, experience and by describing management controls that will be established and used to monitor individual and/or overall tasks to include the mechanism for retaining the proposed labor skill mix.

The Offeror's management approach should clearly demonstrate their ability to deliver services and capabilities on-time, within budget, and with the required service quality. The offeror's proposed organizational structure and staffing should clearly demonstrate the offeror's ability to successfully accomplish all tasking in the PWS. <br />Offerors shall identify current information technology certifications held by key technical positions included in the proposal. Offerors shall address the extent to which the proposed key personnel have committed themselves to work on this effort. If the key personnel have worked on any of the contracts used in past performance, identification of those contracts and the role of key personnel should be stated.<br /><br />Sub-Factor 1: Management organization and business model. Offerors will be evaluated on their overall management organization and business model for accomplishing the requirements of the PWS. Prime/Teaming Partner(s)/1st Tier Subcontractor(s) shall clearly detail each team member's roles and responsibilities, and size of business. The contractor shall also provide a list of all 1st tier sub-contractors. The proposal shall address the autonomy of the on-site Contract Program Manager with respect to management of all personnel, teaming members, Subcontractors, and overall execution of tasking under the IDIQ contract. The offeror's proposed organization and business model shall demonstrate relevant aspects including, but not limited to: proposed plan for utilizing a proposed approach to project planning and scheduling, tools for monitoring, controlling and reporting progress (including the progress of Subcontractors), and the proposed on-site management team for the prime Contractor and all proposed Subcontractors. The offeror's proposal shall describe the role of all proposed Teaming Members and 1st Tier Subcontractors in the overall management and execution of Contract tasking. <br /><br />&bull; Contractor shall provide one example of procedures for recruiting, training and retention to fill vacant positions and maintain continuity of personnel.</p>

Submit no more than two (2) examples for each teaming partner or 1st tier subcontractor and no more than seven (7) examples total.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references for the prime to include specific points of contact, e-mail addresses for those contacts, contract number, contract type, contract period of performance, and brief description of the requirement. In determining whether past performance information is relevant or not relevant, consideration will be given to contracts of similar project complexity, scope, type, and schedule within the Information Assurance security environment. Offeror(s) may be asked for additional information about problems encountered and corrective actions taken when negative information has been submitted by references. If past performance information is either not relevant or not available, then the offeror will be rated neutral (neither favorably nor unfavorably). In addition, the Contracting Officer has the discretion to retrieve information via the offeror's supplied references and federal sources to include the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).</p>
<p>To be considered relevant, the offeror must have been performed within the past three (3) years within the IA environment. All information and references are subject to verification by the Technical Evaluation Team. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information in conducting the evaluation other than the information submitted with the proposals received. The Government will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and cost control and business relations. A list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts completed during the past 3 years, a list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts currently in progress, or a combination of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts that have either been completed in the past 3 years or are currently in progress. Similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders, and/or subcontracts listed may include any contract, delivery order, purchase order and/or subcontract larger than $2,500 entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts shall list similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts as required above for proposed key personnel. Provide the following information for each contract, delivery order, purchase order, and/or subcontract:</p>

<p>The offeror may provide information on both problems encountered and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems on the contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts identified. The offeror should not provide general information on their performance on the <br />identified contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts. General performance information will be obtained from the references provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Award, other government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications. Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) that received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over 3 years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated in terms of Quality of Technical Services and Approach, Quality of Contract Management and Management Approach, and Customer Satisfaction. Each contract shall only be referenced once. Past performance information should be provided for services directly relevant to the services to be performed under the IDIQ PWS. To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three (3) years. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information in conducting the evaluation other than the information submitted with the quotations received. The Government will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and cost control and business relations.<br /><br />Factor 5: Price</p>
<p>Offerors are to submit price proposals that provide complete pricing for services in accordance with the Performance Work Statement and Attachment II - Pricing CLIN Spreadsheet. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of overall price or reflective of an inherent lack of management and/or technical competence or comprehension of the requirements will be further excluded from evaluation.<br /><br />&bull; Total Evaluated Price. Price Analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. Total evaluated price will be calculated on the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers. In establishing the reasonableness of the offered prices, only information that is necessary to determine price reasonableness must be utilized. No additional information from the offeror is necessary, if the price is based on adequate price competition. Information other than cost or pricing data that may be evaluated during a price reasonableness determination is as follows: <br /><br />&bull; Information related to prices (e.g., established catalog or market prices or previous contract prices), relying first on information available within the Government; second, on information obtained from sources other than the offeror; and, if necessary, on information obtained from the offeror. When obtaining information from the offeror is necessary, such information submitted by the offeror shall include, at minimum, appropriate information on the prices at which the same or similar items have been sold previously, adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price.</p>
<p>&bull; Offeror's proposals will also be evaluated for price realism by comparing their proposed prices to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The IGCE is based on historical prices for similar services that have been procured during the last five years as well as labor rates from GSA Schedules.</p>
<p>Offerors shall complete the CLIN Structure/Pricing Spreadsheet - Attachment II of the solicitation including all fixed price line items and cost-reimbursable amounts. Offerors shall not deviate from the estimated amounts provided for the cost reimbursable CLINS.</p>
<p>Offerors shall calculate total for each line item by multiplying the quantity by the unit price. Offerors shall provide a subtotal for each year and an overall total price for the life of the contract. The Government will evaluate proposals for award purposes by adding the total price for all ordering periods to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of separately priced line items shall not obligate the Government to purchase separately priced line items. The Government may, at its discretion, accept any or all separately priced line items proposed by an awardee, if that awardees proposal for separately priced line items is sufficiently attractive.</p>
<p>The primary means of determining the "fairness and reasonableness" of proposed prices will be through competition and the comparison of the prices offered in response to this solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors are placed on notice that any proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical and management commitment or unrealistically low in overall price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of management and technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements.</p>
<p>Technical Approach, Management Approach, Quality Control and Past Performance are listed in descending order of importance , and when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>E.9 BASIS FOR AWARD - TRADE-OFF SOURCE SELECTION PROCESS <br />The Government will award up to three (3) contracts, on an all or none basis, resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, all factors considered. Prospective offerors are advised that in consideration of Best Value a proposal meeting the solicitation requirements with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher priced offeror is determined to be more advantageous to the Government.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Sellers must include, extended specs and/or manufacturer name and part numbers (if applicable).  Failure to do this may be cause for termination.  This information is REQUIRED in order for a sellers bid to be deemed 'responsive' and to be considered for award. FAR 52.211-6<BR><BR>Q&A -Please submit all questions by using the 'Submit a Question' button. This buy will then be reposted with Q&A based on the questions that come in (if applicable).<BR><BR>1) Each component must support deduplication; primary must not require extra processing time to reconstitute files into non-de-duplicated form; if being bid as a single solution, rather than primary/archive, the entire solution must not require extra processing time
2) The solution must be able to support 400 GB enterprise fiber-channel flash drives natively; the solution may be bid without 400 GB flash drives, but it must at least support them, for purposes of future growth and scalability
3) Actually within a LUN; this is a requirement for primary only, unless being bid as a single solution, in which case the entire solution must support this
4) Cache is mandatory, fast is relative; we don't see a way to reach IOPS and footprint without fast cache; it may not be required if there is an alternate, technically acceptable solution which comes in within budget, footprint and meets our IOPS and data storage requirements
5) 10GbE is mandatory<BR><BR>3. SOW Section 4.3, page 5: What is the breakdown percentage of SSD, FC and SATA drives required (e.g 30/30/40%)?- There is no specific breakdown required. Ensure to meet footprint, IOPS, storage and other requirements, regardless of how it is broken down.
4. Will the use of a Virtual Tape Library be part of the dedupe requirements?- VTLs were not taken into account; we will also be using normal tape backup, not VTL at the moment
5. What is the projected percentage of data that will be required to be deduped (e.g.25%)?- Approximately 25% is a good assumption for both primary and archive; without an equivalent solution to test, we could not get more accurate projections
6. For "Support for CIFS and NFS" what is the projected ratio of FILE/Block? (e.g., 95% Block/5% File)- For the primary storage solution, CIFS is a highly preferred nicety, but we will primarily be using NFS and block storage (Oracle databases)- For the archive storage solution, both CIFS and NFS are required, and we will have a changing mix of file and block storage (maybe 70% file 30% block, but unsure; needs to be flexible)
7. What is the projected number of hosts ports to be connected to the SAN Array?- For the primary storage solution, projecting a minimum of 6-8 (3-4 multipathed) ports connecting to the SAN array; perhaps more, so we need room for growth. Basically, we have 3 (perhaps 4) database servers which are critical to connect, but need more density available for staging, testing, failover, etc.- For the archive storage solution, we primarily plan on using 10GbE iSCSI connections to the archive, but fiber should also be an option. We will have dozens of systems using this SAN, although many are being virtualized on blades, which should cut down connections. The more connections the better.- Remember, our switching fabric is 8Gb and need 10GbE; 4Gb fiber and 1GbE is not useful
8. What is the projected ratio of IOPS (e.g. 70% Reads/30% Writes)?- For the primary storage solution, we will have about 95% writes. For the archive storage solution, it will be about 50/50, though this is an unknown and variable.
9. What is the expected Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and the Recovery Point Objective (RPO)?- We are running mission critical 24x7x365 systems, which are constantly in use by end users; we aim for 100% availability and 100% data integrity; therefore RTO and RPO are moot.<BR><BR>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new and re-engineered FTA Bus Program is founded on the philosophy that "one size does not fit all" in the implementation of safety, security, and emergency preparedness efforts. Consistent with the "one size does not fit all" philosophy, the existing self-assessment tool was designed specifically for use by rural and small urban transit agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been validated through the onsite review process as an effective instrument in identifying smaller transit system strengths and areas in need of improvement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This tool shall have only limited applicability for use with mid-size and large transit bus agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Therefore a new and expanded self-assessment tool that reflects the operating characteristics and environments of mid to large transit agencies must be developed to support the evaluation of safety, security, and emergency preparedness performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a federal agency within the Department of Commerce (DOC) that is focused on the condition of the oceans and the atmosphere. The NOAA mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our nation's economic, social and environmental needs. As a supplier of environmental information products, NOAA provides the nation with information that pertains to the state of the oceans and the atmosphere. This is clearly manifest in the production of weather warnings and forecasts through the National Weather Service, but NOAA's information products extend to climate, ecosystems and commerce as well. NOAA serves as the steward of national coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.</p>
<p>NOAA is a trusted source of accurate and objective scientific information in four particular areas of national and global importance which constitute its long-term mission critical and strategic goals:<br />&bull; Ecosystems: Ensure the sustainable use of resources and balance competing uses of coastal and marine ecosystems, recognizing both their human and natural components. <br />&bull; Climate: Understand changes in climate, including the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon, to ensure that we can plan and respond properly. <br />&bull; Weather &amp; Water: Provide data and forecasts for weather and water cycle events, including storms, droughts and floods. <br />&bull; Commerce &amp; Transportation: Provide weather, climate, and ecosystem information to make sure individual and commercial transportation is safe, efficient and environmentally sound.</p>
<p>To assist it in framing its long-term strategic course in many complex and interrelated scientific and technical topics, NOAA requires studies to be done with a high level of credibility, impartiality, and objectivity. This requires an understanding of the current state of science as well as an intimate knowledge of newly emerging scientific and technical methodologies to support recommendations for future directions NOAA should take into consideration while laying out its strategic plan to meet its mission goals. Possible areas to be investigated through studies, but are not limited to, the following areas of interest:<br />&bull; Integrated Observing and Data Management System<br />&bull; Assessments and Forecasts of Coastal and Marine Ecosystems<br />&bull; Scenario Development to Support Specific Management Actions and Decisions<br />&bull; Exploring Unknown and Little Known Areas of Earth's Oceans<br />&bull; Capacity Building and Effective Knowledge Transfer<br />&bull; Integrated Global Observation and Data System<br />&bull; Documenting and Understanding Changes in Climate Forcings and Feedbacks<br />&bull; Improving Climate Predictions and Projections<br />&bull; Understanding Impacts of Climate Variability and Change on Marine Ecosystems<br />&bull; Enhancing NOAA's Operational Decision Support Tools<br />&bull; Improving Weather Forecasts and Warnings<br />&bull; Water Resources Forecasting<br />&bull; Providing Information to Air Quality Decision Makers and Establishing and Improving a National Air Quality Forecast Capability<br />&bull; Improving Understanding and Forecast Capability in Coasts, Estuaries, and Oceans<br />&bull; Reduced Risks to Life, Health, and Property<br />&bull; Issues that Slow or Stop Movement of Goods<br />&bull; Reduced Risks and Adverse Environmental Impacts<br />&bull; Security</p>
<p>Based upon a thorough review of both the government's requirements and market research conducted under the Sources Sought Notice for this solicitation, NOAA intends on soliciting and negotiating a sole source indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract with the National Academy of Sciences (Academy) for independent scientific, technical, and policy guidance services from scientists and others in a variety of environmental and public policy issues to provide independent scientific advice which shall result in compilation of written reports. The proposed period of performance is for a period of three years tentatively starting March 30, 2011. The total value of this effort is estimated to be no more than $9.9 Million.</p>
<p>The Academy performs a unique public service. It brings together leaders from academia, industry, government, and other sectors to address critical national issues and provide cogent, unbiased, and scientifically informed advice to the U.S. Government and its citizens. To a degree unmatched elsewhere, these institutions elicit the participation of virtually any scientist whom it invites to serve. The credibility of the resulting reports is maximized by the recognized impartiality of the institutions which manufacture no product, possess no funds to disburse, have no power of decision over the scientific establishment and have no executive or regulatory authority. Thus, neither it nor its transient working committees which may be given immediate responsibility for a particular study or inquiry can be fairly accused of a vested interest in the outcome of deliberations.</p>
<p>Moreover, because of the type of studies to be completed and their overall significance on public policy, NOAA has determined after reviewing all market research capability statements submitted in response to the Sources Sought Notice that the Academy is the only source that can provide this degree of independent advice of unparalleled objectivity of the highest quality that provides an inherent degree of acceptability. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement is Section 303(c)(1) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), and is implemented by FAR 6.301-1, which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>All responsible sources that believe they have the necessary expertise and capacity to provide these studies may submit proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency if received within fifteen (15) calendar days from the posting date. Responses may be forwarded electronically to Joan Clarkston at joan.e.clarkston@noaa.gov or fax at (816)274-6966. The response shall be no more than twenty (20) single-sided pages in length and shall address the following topics:<br />&bull; Organization's Name, Address, Phone Number, Email, and Point of Contact Information<br />&bull; Brief summary describing your organization and purpose. If you are an educational institution, list any specific areas of study (e.g. - degree programs, emphasis programs).<br />&bull; Provide a list of experience and studies in topics that are similar to the above. Discuss how scientific experts and qualified scientists are selected to conduct these studies. Discuss how you would incorporate a wide range of views to give a spectrum of scientific thought in a subject area. If studies were conducted on behalf of the government, list department and agency along with a point of contact name, number, and email address.<br />&bull; List experience/education/certifications of any key personnel relevant to the studies above completed in the past five (5) years. Copies of resumes and a list of relevant papers published should be included. The list should provide at a minimum, the author, name of the study, publication, and date with a synopsis of the study.<br />&bull; Credibility, impartiality, and objectivity of the study by your institution. Since these reports impact environmental and agency policy, your organization should discuss how you will ensure credibility, impartiality, and objectivity in any studies that could be conducted by your organization. In order to maintain this credibility, impartiality, and objectivity, indicate any financial interests that might relate to the studies listed above and provide an explanation of how you would mitigate any potential risk associated with those financial interests. <br />&bull; Include your business size classification (e.g. large business, small business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, SDVOSB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.)</p>

<DESC>Particulars:
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Atmospheric Programs, Climate Change Division, intends to conduct a competitive Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15 procurement under solicitation number SOL-DC-11-00003, Technical and Outreach Support Services for Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program Development and Implementation.  This procurement is full and open.  Award will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is determined to offer the best value to the Government.  The NAICS Code for Environmental Consulting Services is 541620 and the current size standard is $7.0 million.  The Government contemplates multiple award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity contracts as a result of the solicitation.  More specifically, the Government intends to award no more than four contracts as a result of the solicitation.  The anticipated period of performance will be a one-year base period with four one-year option periods.  The anticipated solicitation issue date is on  or about January 24, 2011 with a solicitation closing date on or about February 23, 2011.  Please do not contact the contracting office prior to the projected issue date.  The solicitation will identify the deadline for submission of any questions pertaining to the solicitation requirements; any questions submitted after that deadline may or may not be responded to at the option of the Government.  All responses to questions, clarifications, and/or comments deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer will be promulgated via amendment(s) to the solicitation.  Offerors are advised to monitor the EPA Website and the Federal Business Opportunities Website for issuance of the solicitation and to download any amendments issued during the solicitation period.  No paper copies will be furnished.  Please note, on June 21, 2010 a Sources Sought/Request for Information notice was posted on the Federal Business Opportunities Website (www.fbo.gov).  
Background:
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a rule for the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases (GHG) (also referred to as 40 CFR Part 98) from large GHG emissions sources in the United States. The implementation of the rule is referred to as the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).  40 CFR Part 98 applies to direct greenhouse gas emitters, fossil fuel suppliers, and industrial gas suppliers. In general, the threshold for reporting is 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent per year. Reporting is at the facility level, except for certain suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gases.  An estimated 85-90 percent of the total U.S. GHG emissions from approximately 10,000 facilities are covered by this final rule.  This comprehensive, nationwide emissions data will provide a better understanding of where GHGs are coming from and will guide development of the policies and programs to reduce emissions. In addition, this publicly avai lable data will allow reporters to track their own emissions, compare them to similar facilities, and aid in identifying cost effective opportunities to reduce emissions in the future.  The subject procurement is primarily intended to support the work for the continued finalization of 40 CFR Part 98 and implementation of the GHGRP.  
Scope:
	The purpose of this procurement is to provide support to the Climate Change Division.  The work to be performed under this statement of work corresponds with the task/functional areas listed below.
	A. Technical and Engineering Analyses Support
B. Regulatory Program and Guidance Development Support

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components.</p>
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>
