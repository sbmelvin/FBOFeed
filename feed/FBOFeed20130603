2.   Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) If respondent is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business, provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent.  
3.   A list of all teaming partners with a description of each partner's responsibility. (Limited to one page.)
4.   Comments concerning the draft SOW are welcome and optional. The FAA may or may not respond to any comments received.
5.   Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate for the services described with in the draft Statement of Work, for planning purposes only and for budgetary estimates to be devised.  
6.   completed business declaration form

The Government welcomes substantive comments on the SOW. Please submit comments together with the Capability Statement described below. 

Submission Requirements:

<p>The CNST requires an upgrade for an existing high-resolution atomic force microscope (AFM)-an Asylum Cypher-to enable piezoelectric force microscopy and optimized contact mode imaging for the development of combined high-precision contact mechanics measurements and local piezoelectric properties measurements on ferroelectric materials. The upgrade requires modification of the existing AFM for high voltage operation, as well as a new light source optimized specifically for low-interference noise contact mode measurements.<br /><br />The Asylum Cypher AFM is proprietary to Asylum Research Corporation. Market research has shown that there are no other vendors capable of upgrading the existing AFM owned by NIST or providing equipment compatible with the existing Asylum Cypher AFM system and control software.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 334516- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Asylum Research Corporation for this requirement in the 3rd quarter of fiscal year 2013.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice.

<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to RainDance Technologies Inc., 44 Hartwell Avenue, Lexington, MA 02421-3103 to procure the Raindrop Digital PCR System and consumable kit for NHGRI, NIH Undiagnosed Program.</p>

RainDrop 96 Sample Consumable Kit, Product Code: 20-04410, Quantity: One (1) Each (Includes: RainDrop Source chips, sense chips, PCR tube caps and carrier oil.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to the NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DELIVERY:<br /><br /></span></strong>Delivery will be upon receipt of the approved Purchase Order<br /><br /><strong>JUSTIFICATION:</strong></p>
<p>The RainDrop Digital PCR system will allow the NHGRI Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) Laboratory to perform qPCR without the need for reference standards, will allow for precision by increasing the number of PCR replicates, is capable of analyzing complex mixtures, and provides a linear response to the number of copies present to help enable analysis of small fold change differences. The RainDrop system is based on a picodroplet platform that allows for absolute quantitation of target molecules. Additionally it uses a novel multi-color and intensity-per-marker method that increases the sensitivity of the system by generating a larger amount of droplets per lane. This system will allow UDP laboratory to perform rare allele detection, absolute quantification of gene expression, absolute quantification of nucleic acid standards and absolute quantification of DNA copy numbers and SNP measurement. The RainDrop Digital PCR System is necessary for UDP experiments because it prevents cross contamination of the samples during processing and analysis. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) deem this product as the only source to be used for this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY:</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

Kidde Technologies (61423) is located in Wilson, NC and is the Original Equipment Manufacturer and the only known source to possess full repair capability.  Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1).  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.
 This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Definiens AG to procure Definiens Server XD software. EPA currently uses the Definiens Developer XD software to analyze images. Definiens Server XD Software is capable of multidimensional image analysis for high-content imaging, digital pathology, and radiology and is compatible with Definiens Developer XD software. Therefore, EPA believes Definiens AG is the only vendor capable of providing the software needed by this project.  The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".   All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available.  Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored.  The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether  or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Sammie Jones (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 109 Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.  No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

SYNOPSIS DESCRIPTION
This is a pre-solicitation announcement.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 19 Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center, 4100 East Mississippi Avenue, Suite 900, Glendale, CO 80246 intends to issue a Request for Proposal on this Federal Business Opportunities website the week of June 17th, 2013, for a Trauma-Sensitive Certified Yoga Instructor.

The VA Salt Lake City Health Care System (SLC HCS) has conducted a pilot program for Trauma-Sensitive (TS) Yoga in the Women's Clinic.  The results of this pilot program have had a positive effect.  Trauma-Sensitive yoga is a body-based approach that used the mind and body to promote healing.  This modality of yoga helps to create self-body awareness and calmness and safety for the patients.  By releasing held tension, paying attention to the present, and regulating the nervous system, a somatic approach helps ease the feelings of helplessness, fear, arousal, and disconnection that can arise for trauma patients.  The SLC HCS will be utilizing this program for our Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Military Sexual Trauma (MST) and other physical and psychological trauma.  

This will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract with a base year plus four option years dependent upon contractor performance.

The successful offeror shall have certification in Trauma-Sensitive Yoga from the nationally recognized certificate program of the Trauma Center at the Justice Resource Institute (http://www.traumacenter.org/training/Yoga_Certification_Program.php).

The contractor shall hold sessions in the space provided for them by the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System at 500 Foothill Drive, Salt Lake City, UT.

DOCUMENTATION AND CERTIFICATION

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE
One base year from date of award plus four (4) one-year pre-priced options for renewal dependent upon contractor performance.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The NAICS code is 611699; All Other Miscellaneous Schools and Instruction.  The Small Business Size Standard is $10.0 million.  

The solicitation package will be available for download the week of June 17, 2013.  Proposals submitted shall be due no later than June 24, 2013, 1:00PM Mountain Standard Time.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting all of the requirements for providing peculiar initial spare parts and consumables for use within the F-35 United States Reprogramming Laboratory (USRL) for the 513 Electronic Warfare Squadron, 53 Electronic Warfare Group, 53 Wing, at Eglin Air Force Base.
<p>The Air Force intends to issue a contract to procure USRL peculiar initial spares and consumables for use within the USRL. Spares are needed to ensure availability of USRL Mission Data Development to the DoD's F-35 community; ensuring current and projected test and evaluation, training, and operational mission requirements are met. Schedule is critical for this procurement with the delivery schedule for the delivery schedule for various spare items ranging from 6 months After Contract Award (ACA) to 12 month ACA. Spares are supporting the Radar Stimulator. Examples of spare components to be procured include, but are not limited to, the following: Board Assembly, Range/PhaseCode, Board Assembly, Cal A/D, Board Assembly, Discrete Clock, Board Assembly, Fiber Channel Processor, Target Channel Processor Assembly, GUI/Trajectory Processor Assembly, Assembly NB Upconverter Module, Assembly RF ECM Module, Assembly Noise Module, Assembly Horn Switch Module, Assembly LO Distribution Module.<br />The Air Force anticipates utilizing a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.

All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their CCR. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. <br />All interested contractors shall submit a 6-8 page capabilities document. Provide recent, relevant experience in all areas, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was.

This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.<br />If you have any questions, you may contact Ms. June Crockett, Contracting Specialist, at June.Crockett@eglin.af.mil or Ms. Karen Wagner, Contracting Officer at Karen.wagner@eglin.af.mil</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE TO DETERMINE THE AVAILABILITY OF POTENTIAL SMALL BUSINESSES (E.G., 8(A), SERVICE-DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS, HUBZONE SMALL BUSINESS, SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS, VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS, AND WOMEN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS) IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 7.104(D). THE POTENTIAL SMALL BUSINESS WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE COMMERCIAL SERVICES AS SPECIFIED BELOW.<br />History:
<p>CMS uses commercial banks to perform payment services in two different arenas: 1) to process Medicare payments authorized by the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) 2) to process payments for CMS demonstration projects.</p>
<p>A. Medicare Payments Authorized by the MACs</p>
<p>Title XVIII of the Social Security Act authorizes CMS to use claims processing contractors to authorize and make payments for Medicare services. A Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) is an organization that has entered into an agreement with the CMS to perform specified functions under the Hospital Insurance Program (Part A) and/or under the Supplemental Medical Insurance Program (Part B). These functions include, but are not limited to: making payments to providers of Part A and Part B services and making payments to beneficiaries, physicians and suppliers furnishing Part B medical services. Currently, these Medicare claims processing contractors include Part A and B Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs), Part B Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carriers (DMERCs)/Durable Medical Equipment MACs (DMACs), Part A Fiscal Intermediaries (FIs), and Part B Carriers. Currently there are 15 A/B MACs and 4 DMACs.</p>
<p>CMS will utilize two commercial banks meeting our requirements to process Medicare payments. Using a Letter of Credit authorized by CMS in coordination with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the designated commercial banks will draw funds from the Medicare Trust Fund utilizing a U.S. Department of the Treasury Letter of Credit and deposit these funds into Part A and Part B Medicare bank accounts. The amount deposited into these accounts is used to fund the electronic and paper check Medicare payments that are authorized and disbursed by the MAC and presented for payment each day. EFT files are transmitted daily and funded with a draw from the letter of credit. The dollar value of funds for payments from a single financial institution exceeds $5 billion daily. Separate accounts are required for Part A, Part B and DMAC claims payment. In general, a single funding account is established with separate disbursement accounts for each geographic jurisdiction. The banks are required to conduct both weekly and monthly reconciliations of each account as well as invoice CMS on a monthly basis for the fees associated with servicing these accounts. The MACs, in turn, receive a volume of services report provided by the bank to verify that the account services were provided using reports supplied to them by the bank.</p>
<p>B. CMS Demonstration Projects</p>
<p>CMS sponsors a variety of demonstration programs under legislation and/or research requirements which serve to study a variety of health care applications and concepts; currently CMS has 15 operational demonstration projects to be paid through commercial banking services. While the subject of the studies differs among the demonstration projects, the fundamental payment process is universal to these programs. In all cases, a payment file is created and forwarded to the financial institution for processing. Funding is provided separately from specially designated and appropriated funds. Each demonstration project is unique and requires a certain amount of individual attention. Payment processing is universal and consistent between demonstration projects. Demonstration projects are currently operational and are anticipated to grow in number during the term of this contract.</p>
<p>Work Description: The selected financial institution will be expected to perform the following responsibilities:<br />The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to contract with commercial banks to provide commercial banking services for CMS to pay claims processed through Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC) and demonstration project payments. <br />A. The basic functions required of the banks for MACs claim processing include: communicating and coordinating with the MAC; drawing funds from Medicare Trust Fund using a Letter of Credit authorized by CMS in coordination with the U.S. Department of the Treasury; processing and paying electronic fund transfers (EFTs) and paper checks authorized by the MAC; providing on line access to the MAC for daily information, reconciling Medicare bank accounts, preparing reports, keeping records, providing customer services as well as implementation and closing activities. <br />B. The basic functions required of the banks for demonstration projects include: communicating and coordinating with demonstration payment authorization contractors, receiving deposits of funding for payments, processing electronic fund transfers (EFTs) and paper checks disbursed by the demonstration payment authorization contractors, reconciling relevant bank account, preparing reports, keeping records, providing customer services as well as implementation and closing activities. <br />The Financial Institution selected must be currently designated as a Financial Agent of the U.S. Department of the Treasury as defined at 31 CFR PART 202 - DEPOSITARIES AND FINANCIAL AGENTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. The Treasury authority to designate financial agents is found at 31 CFR 202.2.<br />The designated financial institutions will be provided funds for payments to be used solely for payment of items and services covered under the Program of Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled established by Title 18 of the Social Security Act (commonly known as "Medicare"), Medicare demonstration programs or other Medicare programs as required. These are Federal program funds. Such funds must be deposited in a specified and segregated account. This account must be within a member bank of the Federal Reserve System or any "insured bank" within the meaning of the Act creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Act of August 23, 1935 49 Stat. 684 as amended; 12 U.S.C 264) separate from the Contractors other accounts and that have been designated as a Financial Agent of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. <br />The Banking Contractor will be expected to perform the following activities.<br />- Claims Payments<br />- Payment funding<br />- Reconciliation<br />- Provision for Ach Risk Exposure <br />- Imaging of documentation<br />- Internet banking services <br />- Daily transmissions between the contractor/bank/CMS<br />- Technical assistance and customer service<br />- Technical connections and file transmissions to and through CMS<br />- Establishment of accounts and ownership<br />- Testing of Non-base jobs<br />- Invoicing and billing in specified format<br />- Daily/weekly/monthly reporting as defined<br />- Provide references of comparable transaction volume processing, functionality and responsibility<br />- Provide certification of U.S. Treasury designation as a Financial Agent</p>

<DESC>RNA Sequencing<br />Sources Sought Notice<br />RFP HHS-NIH-NIDA-NIA-AM2975853<br />Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bldg. 31, Rm. 1B59 Bethesda, MD, 20892, UNITED STATES
<p>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. <br />Background Information<br />The Laboratory of Molecular Medicine and Neuroscience (LMMN) focuses on the disease Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy, which is caused by JC Virus. JC Virus causes lytic infection of cells of the central nervous system, particularly oligodendrocytes. In order to facilitate research on JC Virus, the LMMN has developed a system of human fetal neural multipotential cells, which can be differentiated into Oligodendrocytes. The differentiation process in humans is poorly understood, so we will perform RNA-seq at numerous time points during the differentiation process to understand gene expression in developing human oligodendrocytes. Our lab does not have the equipment to perform RNA-seq, so we need an outside group to provide this service.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement<br />The service provider will provide RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) for LMMN supplied RNA<br />templates. The RNA-Seq service includes: cDNA synthesis and library preparation, detection of<br />sequencing fragments using the Illumina platform, and an alignment of reads against a reference<br />genome. The primary objective of the study is to determine changes in gene expression and RNA splicing that occur during oligodendrocyte differentiation.</p>
<p>Capability Statement<br />Businesses that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contract Specialist. The capabilities statement must specifically address each project requirement separately. Additionally, the capability statement should include 1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientists, medical experts, and technical personnel as it relates to the above outlined requirements, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, 4) an outline of previous research projects that are similar to the project requirements in which the organization and proposed personnel have participated, and 5) any other information considered relevant to this program.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice. In preparation for an upcoming procurement, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Norfolk, VA on behalf of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Silver Spring, MD is conducting market research to determine potential sources for providing third-party independent peer reviews for the NMFS science. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $14 million. All types of business concerns, large businesses, small businesses, and nonprofit and educational institutions are encouraged to submit a brief, typed Capability Statement in response to this sources sought announcement <br /><br />The nature of the work to be performed primarily involves independently identifying, selecting, and compensating reviewers based on their expert qualifications and rigorous peer review standards, and providing all logistical support for each review. Expertise that may be required will be for various scientific topics related to NMFS fisheries management issues, such as:
<p>&bull; Stock assessments and population dynamic modeling of living marine resources, including fish, marine mammals, or sea turtles;<br />&bull; Socioeconomic assessments and analytical methods;<br />&bull; Oceanographic, ecological, and socioeconomic factors that affect living marine resources;<br />&bull; NMFS' mission-related science and research program reviews;<br />&bull; Biological opinions, recovery plans, and status reviews for the Endangered Species Act, and other protected species; and<br />&bull; Review of sampling design and technologies, analytical methods, and strategies of scientific programs or management strategies.</p>
<p>Deliverables in the form of final peer review reports are also independently reviewed by the contractor's qualified technical team before delivery to the NMFS.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG).

The USCG WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MANUALS OR DRAWINGS FOR THIS REQUIREMENT.</strong> Suppliers must be able to provide necessary certifications including a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM for the above identified parts. Traceability means that the supplier must be able to show a clear documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part, from the OEM to the final vendor.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the U.S. Coast Guard to understand your product, configurations and options. Also, state approximate lead-time for acquiring your product. Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product.

The estimated period of performance is fifteen (15) months. The resultant contract will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract. It has been determined that NIITEK, Inc. is the Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

<p>Project Background: In order to minimize the probability of SCSR failures and subsequent miner's deaths, NIOSH and its predecessor have conducted a program entitled: the Long term Field Evaluation Program (LTFE). This Program has been in place since the introduction of SCSRs (over 20 years). Each year NIOSH collects deployed SCSRs from active mines across the country and replaces those devices with new units of the same model and manufacturer. The number of each type collected is determined by their portion of the total population of SCSRs in use. Replacing the collected SCSRs with units of the same kind is required/necessary since each manufacturer's unit operates differently and miners at that mine must be trained on the specific device. Mixing of different models of SCRS at any mine would cause confusion and increase the probability of death in an emergency. The collected SCSRs are taken to NPPTL where they are inspected and evaluated for their life support capacity. This program has identified many unexpected failures over the years of operation and have resulted in recalls of SCSRs and improved SCSR design. Miner's lives have been saved by units that would likely have failed if not upgraded due to the LTFE Program.</p>
<p>This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.</p>

Secondary Point of Contact g. Description* - THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. This work (HITECH Audit Support) will be done as modification 000005 to an existing contract, GS-23F-0133M/ HHSM-500-2012-00042G that was awarded to FIGLIOZZI AND COMPANY. IAW FAR Part 8.4, this contract was competitively awarded on April 16, 2012 and approved to be awarded as &ldquo;Time and Materials&rdquo;. The main goal of the HITECH Act is to improve the nation&rsquo;s health care through the adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and promotion of the meaningful use of EHR via incentive payments. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) expects that &ldquo;meaningful EHR users&rdquo; would demonstrate each of the following: meaningful use of a certified EHR, the electronic exchange of health information to improve the quality of health care, and reporting on clinical quality and other measures using certified EHR technology. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), along with CMS, has identified criteria to define meaningful use of EHR. In the early stages of meaningful use, Eligible Professionals and Eligible Hospitals will attest that they are meaningful users of EHRs. Upon attestation, they will be eligible to receive an incentive payment. CMS has been tasked to design and develop the necessary systems functionality to enable implementation of the HITECH Act. CMS Office of Financial Management (OFM) is responsible for auditing various components of the HITECH program, and oversees the audit process and the contractor is needed to perform the actual audit of the &ldquo;meaningful EHR users&rdquo;. CMS is responsible for providing oversight of the types of organizations listed above. CMS's oversight of &ldquo;meaningful EHR users&rdquo; is a monitoring control process designed to ensure they are in compliance with regulations established within applicable HITECH law, and therefore eligible to participate in the incentive program. Upon the completion of the audit, the contractor is required to communicate non compliances identified to the organizations or personnel. CMS Management will evaluate the evidence in order to make a final determination of each &ldquo;meaningful EHR users&rdquo; eligibility. The ARRA specifies that CMS shall commence making payments effective January 1, 2011, or as soon as CMS systems are capable. The audit process will need be started soon after the first payments are made. The Government awarded a Times and Material contract. No other contract type is suitable for this effort. At the time, it was not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. The Project Officer has not been able to accurately estimate, with a reasonable degree of confidence, the amount of time required to complete the effort. The contracting officer is aware and intends to require appropriate Government surveillance of contract performance in order to give reasonable assurances that efficient methods and effective cost controls are being used. The contracting officers intends to request periodic floor checks be performed by the CMS cost pricing staff in order to meet this requirement. h. Place of Contact Performance: Contractor&rsquo;s facility

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List), and Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 17, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>

<DESC>The Network 11 Contracting Office (NCO 11) hereby gives notice of intent to award a sole source Interim contract to First Community Care, LLC, 60 Northpointe Parkway, Amherst, NY 14228 to continue to provide Home Oxygen Services to VISN 11 facilities in located Battle Creek, MI, Saginaw, MI and Danville, IL.  
NCO 11 intends to negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  First Community Care, LLC is the incumbent and the only practicable, responsible source to provide continuity of services. Services are required immediately while the protest for the long-term Home 02 contract (VA251-11-RP-0080) is being resolved and the new long-term contract is completed.
A previous solicitation (VA251-11RP-0080) from VISN 11 for Saginaw and Battle Creek, MI and Danville, IL has been protested in the Federal Court of Claims (Civil Action Number 12-114C), and a stay is currently in place until the protest is resolved. A sole source interim contract needs to be created utilizing the existing contractor to eliminate a break in service until the protest has been resolved. If a new contractor was to transition services for this interim contract, all equipment would need to be picked up by the existing contractor, and a re-issuance of equipment would need to occur with the new contractor. Once the long term Home 02 contract was awarded several months later, this process would take place again, which would cause extreme hardships, stress, and a break in service to our Veterans.
Please do not request a copy of a solicitation.  This notice is neither a request for competitive proposals, nor is it a solicitation of offers. Any response to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government and any capability statement provided must address services listed above. 
Written communication received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative written response is received on or before June 10, 2013, the contract will be awarded without further notice.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email at connie.mckay@va.gov.  A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 
THIS SYNOPSIS DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTRACT FOR ANY SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS.

Questions and Answers 1

Q1.	On the Unit Price fill-in form (pages 5 through 17) the following items appear:
a.	# 3  Antibody Identification/Capitated
b.	# 7  Antiglobulin-Directed/Capitated
c.	# 17  Cell Elution ID/Capitated
d.	#20  Crossmatch Electronic Capitated
e.	# 21  Crossmatch Serological Capitated
f.	#58  Type and Screes Capitated
All of these items fall under Compatibility Services.  With a Capitated Compatibility Agreement, the first 3 items are included at No Charge, while the last 3 items are all considered as "Procedures."  The capitated agreement provides for a range of "Procedures" for a certain monthly flat rate.  I can either leave these 6 items blank, or mark them as "Included in Capitated Compatibility Agreement" since they will be covered in the later Solicitation.
A1.  Solicitation Amendment A00002 is posted which revises the Supplies/Services list.  The items listed above are excluded from the revised list.  

Q2.  Instead of filling-in the Unit Price forms (pages 5 through 17), can we submit a two-page spreadsheet with the exact same information?  Or, would you prefer to have us fill in the forms and also submit the spreadsheet as supplemental information?
A.2  Either is acceptable as long as it is the items/services that are requested in the solicitation.

Q3.   Do you need copies of any of our licenses or registrations - for example our FDA Registration?
A3.    Please submit copies of registrations, certifications or accreditations from:  The Food and Drug Administration , The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB), The College of American Pathologists (CAP), or the Joint Commission.

<SUBJECT>Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) - Methods of Improving Air Traffic Radar Performance
<SOLNBR>USTCTT0513
<RESPDATE>070113
<CONTACT>Mark Surina, Manager, ORTA, Email USTCCS-ORTA@ustranscom.mil
<DESC>United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is seeking non-federal partners ("Collaborators") in industry and/or academia to consider for entry into Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) (described in 15 USC 3710a) to:
<p>- Collaboratively explore, develop, and potentially demonstrate innovations in/techniques of mitigating the performance degradations imposed on air traffic radars by various large obstacles and provide an integrated view of the air traffic in the airspace volume above the obstacles which is roughly equivalent to what would be provided if the obstacles were not present.</p>
<p>- Potentially conduct field trials of the pertinent techniques, including hardware and software components, supporting equipment and procedures, and user interfaces to assess utility in mitigating performance impacts.</p>
<p>The products of the collaborative research will be reports regarding the nature of the techniques and paper studies and/or field trials demonstrating the techniques' feasibility, utility, proposed Concepts of Operations, costs, and risks and descriptions of the technical details of proposed techniques.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for a procurement contract, nor should this announcement be construed as implying any future solicitation by USTRANSCOM or any other government agency in this area.</p>
<p>Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this announcement. Potential Collaborators may team with other qualified non-federal parties. <br /><br />Specific development and demonstration goals will be determined during discussions prior to CRADA signature, and refined if necessary during the life of the CRADA.</p>
<p>Multiple federal agencies may participate on behalf of or in partnership with USTRANSCOM, including agencies of Air Mobility Command (AMC, U.S. Air Force), other Federal Laboratories, and other agencies of the U.S. Government, as the U.S. Government deems appropriate.</p>
<p>Supporting information, discussions, demonstrations, and other collaborative activities should remain at the UNCLASSIFIED level. If classified information exchange is proposed by the Collaborator, Collaborator personnel must be appropriately cleared at the outset of the CRADA, at no cost to the government.</p>
<p>CRADAs are defined in 15 USC 3710a(d), in part, as "any agreement between one or more federal laboratories and one or more non-federal parties under which the Government, through its laboratories, provides personnel, services, facilities, equipment, intellectual property or other resources with or without reimbursement (but not funds to non-Federal parties) and the non-Federal parties provide funds, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, intellectual property, or other resources toward the conduct of specified research or development efforts which are consistent with the missions of the laboratory; except that such term does not include a procurement contract..."</p>
<p>CRADAs resulting from this announcement are forecast to be in effect for approximately a 1-year period, although duration can be tailored to suit the parties' needs before or even after work begins, by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>USTRANSCOM and other designated government agencies selected by USTRANSCOM will evaluate potential Collaborators' white papers (submittal instructions follow). Based on response to the RFI's requested response elements and Government interest and capacity to enter into such agreements, USTRANSCOM will choose one, multiple, or zero white papers as basis for additional discussion, and so notify the respondents.</p>
<p>Initial selection of white papers and subsequent discussions do not guarantee selection of any Collaborator by USTRANSCOM to actually enter into a CRADA.</p>
<p>After initial white paper selection, the government will conduct discussions separately with each selected Collaborator, seeking to reach mutual agreement between USTRANSCOM and the Collaborator(s) on objectives, duration, intellectual property, and resources to be applied by the parties in the proposed CRADA(s). The government may choose to visit pertinent facilities for a tour of Collaborator capabilities prior to final selections.</p>
<p>No funding is available from the government to cover white paper preparation or submittal costs, or to cover discussions, facility visits or any other Collaborator costs of preparation or participation in a CRADA.</p>
<p>The USTRANSCOM template CRADA is available for download at http://www.transcom.mil/about/org/tccs/Model_USTRANSCOM_CRADA.pdf<br />so potential Collaborators may understand its terms. The Collaborator(s) and USTRANSCOM will draft and seek to finalize specific CRADA objectives and language collaboratively via discussions/mutual agreement after white paper selection.</p>
<p>Interested parties may respond with white papers by unclassified e-mail to USTCCS-ORTA@ustranscom.mil by submitting an UNCLASSIFIED written white paper in following format. Hardcopy submittal is not allowed.</p>
<p>Please use the following format:</p>
<p>- Microsoft Word or .pdf format of not more than 8 pages in length, on standard 8&frac12; by 11-inch page, with 1-inch margins at top, bottom, left and right, in Times New Roman font of not less than 12-point size, with not more than 6 lines per inch.<br /><br />- Pages numbered sequentially in the bottom footer including company name and identification of proprietary information as appropriate on each page. Proprietary information or trade secrets do not have to be disclosed in this response, if the general technique can be otherwise described.<br /><br />- Clearly marked/identified proprietary information, photos, or diagrams.</p>
<p>- Include the following elements (within the 8-page limit): <br />-- Title (no separate title page needed).<br /><br />-- Company name and state/nation of incorporation, and incorporation of any parent entity. Companies with foreign ownership or parentage must identify the nation of incorporation of the non-U.S. entity.</p>
<p>-- Company's experience with radar research and development, operation, and maintenance and work in mitigating performance degradation; list DOD or other points of contact with whom work has been performed, and address/phone numbers as references, if available.</p>
<p>-- Description of the proposed technique to be explored under the CRADA:<br /><br />--- Description of the technique(s) proposed to be employed; their current maturity (Technology Readiness Level) and examples of successful use in prior applications (or rationale for predicted performance).</p>
<p>--- Description of equipment and setup/support requirements.</p>
<p>--- Integration needs: what infrastructure, procedures, environment, training, communications, coordination, equipment certifications or other features are required to make use of this technique feasible for actual use?</p>
<p>--- Status of FAA certification for use in the United States for the equipment/techniques</p>
<p>--- Theoretical reliability and expected reliability/accuracy in use; limitations of the method that will affect performance in use; metrics on expected improvement (or preservation) of radar performance measured in (but not limited to) Probability of Detection and False Target or False Track Rejection).</p>
<p>--- Predicted cost/affordability/lifecycle cost (cost for equipment, installation, training, and maintenance costs for use during the system's life cycle)</p>
<p>--- Resources to be supplied by the Collaborator during the CRADA (examples: facilities, overall personnel expertise, information systems, proprietary techniques, hardware, software, materials, prototypes, etc.).<br /><br />--- Resources requested from USTRANSCOM (examples: personnel skillsets, data, access to selected environments, test/demo facilities, etc.; no DOD-provided funding is permitted).<br /><br />--- Describe any open source software and any third-party software to be provided by the Collaborator. <br /><br />--- Describe any third-party proprietary information proposed for use in the CRADA and status of agreements to use such information<br /><br />--- Describe your capability to innovate, ability to translate performance needs to system designs, promote understanding of the entire system and its integration requirements; work collaboratively with the government to mitigate risks of development, production, or operations; analyze, simulate, model, author reports and otherwise apply resources and expertise pertinent to collaborative investigation/development <br /><br />--- Points of contact (name, point of contact, address, e-mail, and phone) for notification of selection/non-selection and follow-on discussions/visits (if chosen) <br /><br />USTRANSCOM and other government entities participating in white paper review and actual collaborative work under CRADAs may include in-house support contractors and members of Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs). Non-disclosure agreements will be signed as required by the Parties to incorporate these participants. The USTRANSCOM Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA) advisor (coordinator of USTRANSCOM Technology Transfer activities) is a member of the MITRE Corporation, an FFRDC. <br /><br />Proposals not selected for further discussion will be archived by the government and appropriately protected.</p>

<p>FAR 52.252-1 -- Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference<br />This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es): http://farsite.hill.af.mil<br />(End of provision)</p>

Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. <br />(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal. Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. <br />(c) The offeror should check here to opt out of this clause<br />[ ] Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.<br />(End of provision)</p>

<p>FAR 13.106-2 Evaluation of Quotations or Offers:<br />The Government intends to award one purchase order as a result of this Request for Quote to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures. Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated. Offerors must be determined to be responsible according to the standards of FAR Part 9 to be eligible for award. <br />Award will be based on the total overall lowest price quoted for the Base Year and One (1) Option Year which meets or exceeds the acceptability standard for the non-price factor, Past Performance Record. Any offeror who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance record will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price. <br /><br />Past Performance Record<br />The Offeror shall describe their background, knowledge and experience related to the performance of ASRS equipment preventive and remedial maintenance support services. Of particular emphasis is performance that was executed in accordance with the same or similar scope and magnitude that is described in the SOW. Past performance information is used in determining the level of confidence the Government has for successful performance based upon the Offeror's actions under previously awarded, relevant contracts.</p>
<p>The Government shall only consider relevant past performance data. To be considered relevant, the Offeror must demonstrate past execution of similar contracts in terms of scope, complexity, technology, magnitude of effort, and schedule. The Offeror must demonstrate through past performance an ability to perform the work described in the solicitation. This is done by demonstrating that they have successfully executed contracts of similar scope and magnitude within the past five (5) years. The Government recommends submission of at least three (3) contracts, but will evaluate any and all submitted. Offerors shall provide a detailed explanation of the relevance of the contracts or efforts to the requirements as defined in the SOW. If subcontractor experience is provided as part of the most relevant contracts, it will be given weight relative to the percentage of effort being provided by that particular subcontractor in the offer submitted. The references will be evaluated in the aggregate in order to allow Offerors who may not have the entire scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement under one individual contract to still be considered relevant if experience with the full scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement can be demonstrated within the allotted number of references as described above.<br />If an Offeror or its subcontractor determines they have no past performance data, they shall provide the following statement in lieu of the information requested below: "(Insert Offeror or subcontractor's name) has determined that they possess no past performance information in accordance with the RFQ."</p>
<p>The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submittal by the offeror of past performance information from three (3) sources that clearly indicate they have satisfactorily performed Preventive and Remedial Maintenance of Litton Mini-Load Storage Retrieval Machines, or similar Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) equipment, commercially or for the Government within the past five (5) years.</p>
<p>This information shall consist of the following:<br />(1) An index of previous contract data that contains three or more prime contracts and/or subcontracts that the Offeror is currently performing or has completed during the last five years. The index shall include:<br />- Contractor Name<br />- Name of the customer/agency<br />- Contract/Purchase Order Number<br />- Customer point of contact (provide name, telephone number, and e-mail address)<br />- Length of contract<br />- Period of performance (dates)<br />- Initial Contract Price<br />- Final Contract Price or price as of the last modification<br />- Description of equipment for which maintenance was provided (include sufficient detail to demonstrate the scope and complexity of the maintenance provided)<br />- Facilities in which the service was performed<br />- Quality of Past Performance; to include a discussion of actual performance under each contract listed, including problems encountered; how they were resolved; the timeliness of deliverables required; how costs were controlled; business relationships; management of personnel, and any other areas deemed necessary to provide insight into actual performance issues</p>
<p>(2) A narrative synopsis that shall describe the specific nature of the work, similarities with the proposed work and the relevant experience gained.</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. 
HQ Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-5527 Facsimile Number:  (703) 806-8866 or 8875

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.5.&nbsp; The North American Industry Classification System Code is&nbsp;541922 and the business size standard is $6.5 Million. <br /><br />In a national effort to promote patient safety, NLM has undertaken the creation of an authoritative, comprehensive, public digital image inventory of the nation's commercial prescription solid dose medications. Our effort is a continuation and extension of three previous projects: providing the Veterans Administration with a complete digital photographic catalog of the VA Centralized Mail Order Pharmacy formulary for prescription tablets and capsules, the establishment of the NLM Pillbox information resource, and the NLM Computational Photography Project for Pill Identification (C3PI).
<p>We are creating a collection of digital photographs of prescription tablets and capsules or Oral Solid Dosage Formulations (OSDFs). The purpose of this announcement is to provide for the continuation of image acquisition of OSDFs through an open commercial competition for R&amp;D support services. The resulting award for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract will be made to a contractor or vendor who will be responsible for acquiring the sample medications (if necessary), handling, transporting, and storing medication samples, creating high resolution digital photographs of the front (obverse) and back (reverse) surfaces of the samples using conventional techniques for color management and size measurement, confirming that the images match the description of the medication, developing and matching the images of the samples to relevant metadata (including size descriptions, dimensions, color, and the provenance of the sample), composing digital images by suppressing the background and combining the front and back images into a single output image, and transmitting those data (images and metadata) to the NLM. As part of the current effort, NLM has crafted a recommended specification, SPLIMAGE, for images of oral solid dose formulations of medications to be included in the FDA's Structured Product Label initiative (see attachment of the SPLIMAGE specification). Responses to this announcement should include the necessary digital processing to generate SPLIMAGE files from the digital photographs of OSDFs. We believe that ultimately nationwide there are between 5,000 and 32,000 prescription oral solid-dose medications to be cataloged through this process.<br />The resulting digital image collection from this effort will be placed by NLM in the public domain. The impact of this collection will target patient safety including assisting in drug identification for poison control hotlines as well as online services for the public and nursing care professionals to confirm the identification of a drug to help prevent mistakes in medication. Other uses of the image collection include education and applications in pharmacy pedagogy such as its inclusion in textbooks and digital teaching materials. These applications demand high resolution, high quality images with good color reproduction to faithfully represent the medications through imagery. Smaller images and subsets of the collection can be generated from the original high-resolution data for other applications that do not require the same level of fidelity; however, we are committed to acquiring the best data possible through this mechanism.</p>
<p>NLM intends to identify a contractor or assemble a contractor-and-subcontractor team to address these issues, with the emphasis on experienced digital macro-photography talent as well as credentials and experience necessary to safely handle oral solid-dose prescription medications. The matching of the images to the correct identification of the medications is at least as critical as the dispensing of the medications to patients for treatment in that the impact of a mis-identification could have grave consequences. The need for quality control and verification in this project is likely to be significantly higher since the distribution of the resulting data could have widespread public impact, both a positive one if the collection is comprehensive and detailed, and significant negative impacts if there are errors in the database. The contractor should have clear explicit procedures for verifying the data and its correct correspondence to the medications from which it was derived. NLM expects the final team to incorporate photographers, assistants familiar with the handling of pharmaceuticals, a pharmacist for the appropriate qualifications in receiving, handling, and disposing of prescription medications, administrative technicians for the verification and electronic delivery of the digital images and their associated data, and information technology support for image processing and digital composition of the resulting reference images, the extraction of metadata, and technical support of the digital camera, its software, data storage and backup, as well as internet support to enable the electronic delivery of the digital data.</p>
<p>Optional work: A possible byproduct of this award, generated through an option to the primary contract, would be a test data collection for the advancement of automatic pharmaceutical identification through computer vision from photographic data. NLM expects to promote computer vision research applied to the domain of content-based information retrieval (CBIR) of solid-dose pharmaceuticals. The current C3PI effort has created an initial set of such images from the ongoing imaging of OSDFs and anticipates the continuing need for generating test data, including variations of photographs of the same drug or sample under different conditions and with different cameras or equipment. We invite ideas and plans for the structure for such a test collection subset of the overall imaging effort including a discussion of issues such as: (1) the number of validated sample images needed to evaluate automated drug identification algorithms, (2) the different photographic conditions and equipment necessary to effectively support a test image collection, and (3) a plan for deploying and maintaining such a collection in support of a grand challenge or other mechanism for promoting computer vision for solid-dose pharmaceutical identification.</p>
<p>We anticipate that this award will encompass the handling, storage, photography, and the electronic delivery of the resulting digital data of between 500 and 1,000 prescription medications over the course of one year. Therefore, proposals addressing this requirement should not surpass 1 year in duration. Up to four (4) option years for additional services with a duration of 1 year each per option (the additional acquisition of images of pharmaceutical samples in lots of between 500 and 1,000 samples) should be provided by teams responding to this requirement. Teams should also address in their proposals a additional separate option for crafting a test data collection to promote computer vision for identification of oral solid-dose formulations of pharmaceuticals, including up to four (4) option years for this supplementary effort.</p>
<p>Technical proposals should cover:</p>
<p>(i) Technical details for:<br />1. Sample Acquisition<br />&bull; NLM will prioritize the list of images of samples to be acquired, beginning with the most widely prescribed drugs as well as the those medications that pose a public threat either through abuse or as a poisoning hazard. NLM proposes the use of DailyMed as the source of the initial list of prescription medications (4,676 medications listed as of 10-June-2009)<br />&bull; If samples are offered by participating manufacturers or vendors, the contractor will accept these samples as available.<br />&bull; The contractor will be responsible for establishing a source of medications and ensuring that their supply chain remains viable through the life of this project.<br />&bull; The contractor will establish and maintain procedures that comply with all state and federal regulations for the management, handling, and disposal of prescription medications.<br />2. Photographic quality<br />&bull; The contractor will adhere to image quality guidelines established by the NLM pertaining to issues of: color management (ensuring that the images provided reflect the actual color of the medication), image resolution (Minimum of 6 MPixels for the field including the pharmaceutical sample), file formats, color background (18% grey color background), and fiducial marks for size, color, and white balance. NLM will provide a standard color reference for matching colors in the raw digital images.<br />3. Quality control and Data transfer<br />&bull; The contractor will develop quality control procedures with the NLM for the verification of acceptable images, matching the images with the correct metadata, and data transmission.<br />&bull; Images and metadata will be transferred to NLM, subject to verification.<br />4. Transition plan - project completion<br />&bull; After the data collection is firmly established and the period of performance nears its end, the contractor may be required to transfer the program another contractor. The plan should address a process for disclosing all documentation, file formats, database organization, and open-source software. This transition is essential for the long-term sustainability of the project.</p>
<p>(ii) Qualifications of key personnel to execute this project.<br />1. Background expertise - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team as a whole have access to the range of educational backgrounds in macrophotography, in particular in photography for documenting scientific or records of physical samples.<br />2. Experience - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team include significant experience and expertise in the production workflows for documentation photography.</p>
<p>(iii) The commitment and experience of the institution or offeror in building and releasing public data resources for patient safety in pharmaceutical information.</p>
<p>(iv) Proposed relevant facilities</p>
<p>The Technical Proposal should include examples digital images of pharmaceutical samples, demonstrating the capabilities of the respondent. These images are not included in the 15-page limit. Beyond these digital images 15 pages of technical proposal, resumes of key investigators, reprints of relevant technical papers, and other supplemental materials can be provided outside of the page limit. Reviewers are instructed that the 15-page technical proposal and the representative digital images are required reading, and supplemental materials are available as part of the support documentation but not required.</p>
<p>NLM is specifically seeking contractors with the discipline necessary to conduct this project, adhering to high standards of quality and consistency necessary to acquire high quality reference images through digital macrophotography and to verify and validate that images of these solid-dose pharmaceuticals are accurately tied to their respective medications. Regular progress evaluations may be initiated, and frequent interaction with NLM staff responsible for the imaging informatics and release of the data to the public domain is expected.</p>
<p>The deliverables for this proposed project are the photographs of the solid-dose pharmaceutical samples, the metadata and information for correctly identifying and correlating the images with their corresponding medications. The resulting images and the final data will be owned by the National Institutes of Health and distributed to the public.</p>
<p>NLM reserves the right to include a site visit as part of the proposal evaluation.</p>
<p>NLM reserves the right to include key personnel named in a proposal as well as any or all parts of the technical proposal in the contract award.</p>
<p>NLM anticipates that the first award of the photographic collection (up to 1,000 samples) will be completed within one year and costs not expected to exceed $500,000 including the cost of acquiring and disposing of the sample medications. All proposals will be evaluated on technical merit, qualifications of the personnel (including photographers, computer scientists, image processors, pharmacists, and technicians), cost, and past performance on research and development projects.<br /><br />Electronic copies of the technical proposal are due by the application deadline.

This announcement will close at 12:00 PM (EST) on Tuesday, 11 June 2013.
  Contact Morgan Byrum who can be reached at 757-443-1391 or email Morgan.Byrum@navy.mil.  A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
In accordance with FAR 52.212-1 entitled Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items the Government intends to award a single Firm Fixed Price contract, resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the requirements set forth in the solicitation.
  The offerors proposal shall be in the form prescribed by and shall contain a response to each of the areas identified in solicitation provision FAR 52.212-1 entitled Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items and its requisite Addendum.  The Government intends to award a contract without discussions using streamlined evaluation procedures for evaluation and solicitation as described in FAR 12.6.  The establishment of a competitive range is not anticipated.  Accordingly, each Offeror should submit its most favorable terms from a technical, past performance and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to establish a competitive range and conduct discussions if later determined by the PCO to be necessary.

The following streamlined evaluation shall be used to evaluate offers: Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).
  This process was determined the most appropriate method of attaining the best value for the Government through the selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.  In order to be considered awardable, there must be an Acceptable rating in every non-price factor.  LPTA non-price factors for this requirement will consist of: Technical and Past Performance Acceptability with subfactors under Past Performance consisting of Relevancy and Quality.  Tradeoffs will not be used during the source selection process.  Proposals will be evaluated for acceptability.  

Accordingly, the following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals:
	Technical (Acceptable/Unacceptable)
	Past Performance (Acceptable/Unacceptable)
	Price

1.	Technical Acceptability  The technical proposal will be evaluated on the Offerors demonstrated understanding of the Request for Proposal (RFP) and how its approach will successfully accomplish the requirements of the RFP.
  The technical proposals will be rated acceptable or unacceptable using the ratings and descriptions outlined in the table below.  All unacceptable technical proposals will not be further evaluated.  Each Offerors technical proposal shall address the following: 

	The Offeror shall have a minimum security clearance of SECRET.  
	The Offeror shall be a Certified Lenel Value Added Reseller (VAR) as to not affect warranties and proprietary information requirements.  
o	The offeror shall provide with its proposal its certification as a Certified Lenel Value Added Reseller.  
	The Offeror shall describe its approach to accomplishing the requirements of the PWS.  
o	This approach shall provide a demonstration of the Offerors understanding of, and familiarity with, the specific requirements of the PWS.
  
o	The Offerors approach should be discussed in sufficient detail for the Government to ascertain the Offerors understanding of the requirement and ability to perform the required tasks, and shall convince the Government that the Offeror is capable of fully providing the services identified in the PWS.  

In order to be considered Acceptable, Offerors must receive an acceptable rating for the technical proposal in its entirety.  The Government will evaluate the Offerors Technical Approach based on the information received in the Offerors written proposal. The Government will evaluate each Offerors technical proposal in accordance with the ratings table below:

Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings
Rating	Description
Acceptable	Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.
Unacceptable	Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.
 
	
2.	Past Performance Acceptability  The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the offerors probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements.  This assessment is based on the offerors record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertains to the services outlined in the solicitation requirements.  Past Performance will be rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis using the ratings and descriptions outlined in the table below: 

Table A-2. Past Performance Evaluation Ratings
Rating	Description
Acceptable	Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offerors performance record is unknown.
 (See note below)
Unacceptable	Based on the offerors performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. 

Note:  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)).  Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.  In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, unknown shall be considered acceptable.

In order to facilitate the Governments evaluation of this factor, the offeror shall identify no more than three (3) previous contracts whose effort was relevant to the effort required by this solicitation; the contracts provided should have been performed within the last three (3) years.
  Evaluation will focus only on work experience already performed.  Work yet-to-be performed and work prior to the last three (3) years will not be considered.  In addition, performance data will only be assessed for those references demonstrating at least 1 year of completed performance prior to the closing date of the solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts/orders to the requirements of the solicitation.  The references will be evaluated in the aggregate in order to allow offers who may not have the entire scope or magnitude under one individual contract or task order to still be considered acceptable if experience with the full scope and magnitude or the requirement can be demonstrated within the allotted number of references as described above.
  

In order to verify past performance information and determine the quality of the past performance submission, the Government may contact some or all of the references provided, as appropriate, and may collect information through questionnaires (i.e. the Past Performance Report Form), telephone interviews, and existing data sources to include, but not limited to, CPARS.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  This past performance information will be used for the evaluation of past performance.

There are two (2) aspects/subfactors of past performance evaluation:

1)	The first is to evaluate whether the offerors present/past performance is relevant or not relevant to the effort to be acquired.
  In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to what aspects of an offerors contract history would give the most confidence that the offeror will satisfy the current procurement. 
 
2)	The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts.  The past performance evaluation performed in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offerors past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts.  

3.	Price  The Offerors price submission shall include a complete and signed solicitation form, and if applicable, an executed copy of Amendments.
  The Government will evaluate pricing information submitted in accordance with the solicitations Addendum 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS by comparing it to other Offerors prices or by using any other price comparison techniques deemed to be in the Governments best interest by the Contracting Officer.  

Price will be evaluated by the contracts personnel to determine fairness and reasonableness through the most appropriate method available pursuant to FAR Part 15.403-1.  The total evaluated price will support the selection of the lowest priced technically acceptable offer.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding total price for the base year and all options years, including 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services.
  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  For the purposes of preparing a price proposal, the Offeror shall assume that the basic period of performance shall be 12 months from date of award with two (2) 12-month option periods.  The Government anticipates award on or around 30 May 2013; however, this date is subject to change.  
 
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/  . 
 
All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms.
 Quotes will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number is 10693F1228 and is issued as a Request For Quote, unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-66. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210 with a small business size standard of $25 Million. This requirement is restricted to total small business and only qualified offerors may submit quotes. THIS IS AN ALL OR NOTHING QUOTE. PARTIAL OR INCOMPLETE OFFERS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR CONSIDERED.
<p>Background:<br />The Diplomatic Security Office of Training and Performance Standards (DS/T/TPS) handles 20+ classrooms, 100+ vehicles and 1,000's of pieces of individual equipment for thousands of students yearly. Class lengths and sizes vary widely, as do their meeting cycles. There are four TPS facilities located in three states. Class loads will soon be increasing to meet recent Accountability Review Board recommendations. At present there are multiple individual and public Excel spreadsheets (nonstandard in construction, functions and level of usage), SharePoint calendars, wax boards and clipboards that are used to schedule and track reservations and activities. Very specialized single purpose scheduling systems have also been internally developed.</p>
<p>A TPS resource scheduling application is needed to consolidate all of the TPS resource and scheduling data and provide a consistent interface for an estimated 30 administrators and managers (we are not looking for software development, as we are looking for a customizable software application). A TPS Resource Scheduler tool will need to run across OpenNet to all of the TPS training locations and permit system managers to view and use the same information in all locations. The tool will also be able to produce retrospective reports and projections.</p>
<p>The Department of State has a requirement for a resource scheduling software application, remote installation and integration, training, and maintenance and support (4 years), on a Meet or Exceeds basis, to the following:</p>
<p>A. Minimum Interoperability Requirements:<br />1. We require the ability to install the software on vendor agnostic hardware purchased and maintained by DOS personnel running Microsoft Windows 2008 R2.<br />2. The product must provide the ability to operate without an active internet connection. Product updates must be available for download as a flat file, which can then be transferred using CD or IronKey USB drive. Because the Scheduler will not permit external contact, maintenance updates, if any, will have to be done via hard media (disk or IronKey). <br />3. The product must install and run within DOS OpenNet support seats in all TPS locations.<br />4. The product must interface with DOS SharePoint (MOSS 10) and Outlook 10.<br />5. The underlying database(s) must be commonly used ones such as SQL, Oracle or DB2 and run in the MS Windows 2008 R2 environment.</p>
<p>B. Minimum Performance Functions (for the Customizable Software Application Tool):<br />1. The TPS Resource Scheduler will use a web interface supporting MS IE 7 and up or Google Chrome.<br />2. The product must have an unlimited scheduling capacity for the TPS resource types (e.g., sedan cars, SUV's, and classrooms at each location) and the total number of resources in each type (e.g., 35 cars, 74 SUV's and 9 classrooms at ITF).<br />3. The product must link and associate resources such that a higher level resource (a classroom or race track) can be defined as "coming with" lower level resources (PC's or safety equipment or medical support)<br />4. The product must manage TPS resources using object qualities and business rules.<br />5. The product must support scheduling of expendable and reusable resources.<br />6. The product must support licensed admin or management seats through hierarchical permissions including inheritance.<br />7. The permission structure must support unlimited read-only users without extra costs.<br />8. The product must integrate with DOS Active Directory to support notifications.<br />9. The product must support use of imagery, schematics and other graphics to facilitate end user understanding and insights.<br />10. The following options must be available within the scheduler:<br />a. "Self Scheduling" of a resource with no other manager/admin input<br />b. "Resource Request" for a resource that requires admin approval<br />c. "Resource Assignment" for a resource that is assigned by an admin<br />d. "Recurrence Scheduling" for resource reservations that occur many times<br />e. "Linked Scheduling" for multiple resources that are grouped into one entity <br />11. Reporting of scheduling, utilization and other resource metrics must be available through an internal (vendor) tool or through an add-on such as Crystal Reports. Inclusion of a reporting tool must be part of the product bid.<br />12. A "what-if" or other projection mode must be part of the product to support TPS resource planners in estimating and projecting effects of changes in TPS student loads and course offerings.</p>
<p>C. Minimum Vendor Requirements:<br />1. The vendor has a demonstrable experience in providing service similar to this Requirement to other clients of a similar size.<br />2. The vendor has experience in providing service to U.S. Government clients.<br />3. TPS requires that in the offer the vendor will assist in providing, documentation and demonstration of the purchased technology to assist in accomplishing the internal DOS IT Review Board acceptance of the software on the DOS Intranet (OpenNet.)<br />4. The vendor will provide detailed operation manuals to support TPS standalone operation of the scheduling tool.<br />5. TPS requires the product bid includes initial setup and direct integration assistance in bringing all planned TPS resources into the scheduling tool. Integration will include connectivity with current DOS IT systems (e.g., Outlook). All direct installation and integration efforts must be completed remotely.<br />6. The initial resource setup phase (installation and integration-resource transfer from end user to vendor's software) will be for a period of no less than six weeks of assistance by dedicated vendor personnel.<br />7. The vendor will integrate resource data into the vendor software and convey that to TPS for installation in the TPS instance. This can be done by disk, IronKey or FTP for upload into the TPS instance. No direct Internet connection will be possible.<br />8. Before and during initial setup the vendor will provide training and guidance to designated TPS personnel so that future assets can be added by TPS without reliance on the vendor. Vendor must recommend and provide training for no less than 30 TPS personnel to become subject matter experts for scheduling various resources (classrooms, vehicles, personal equipment, etc.) Training can be onsite or by remote delivery. Vendor must recommend and provide on-site training for five system managers. Vendor should recommend the training type for post-integration and pre-installation. <br />9. In addition to the initial setup the vendor will provide ongoing support by telephone or e-mail Monday-Friday between the hours of 0800 - 2000 Eastern Time with an option of five years of support.<br />10. Vendor must provide hardware specifications to support the software which will meet the requirements. Please specify and provide detailed descriptions, so that DoS can determine if said hardware is not currently in use and will need to be acquired.</p>
<p>Prospective vendors are strongly recommended to respond using the above minimum requirements as a template (providing extensive descriptions and/or illustrations--fully laying out the integration process, etc.) and to also follow the pricing structure indicated as follows (make adjustments as necessary/expand CLINS):<br />CLIN DoS Description <br />0001 Resource Scheduling Software <br />0002 Installation, Integration, Implementation, and Training Services <br />0003 Maintenance and Support (Base) <br />1003 Maintenance and Support (OY1) <br />2003 Maintenance and Support (OY2) <br />3003 Maintenance and Support (OY3)<br />--Offeror may replace DoS Description with Vendor Descriptions, Part Numbers, Unit Prices and Quantities, etc.--</p>
<p>***Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible, preferably 72 hours before the close of this notice, to enable the Buyer to respond. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered. We respectfully request that prospective vendors not make any assumptions.***</p>
<p>In addition to providing pricing for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical descriptions, past performance, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation. Anyone other than the manufacturer, offering the name-brand manufactured products, must provide proof (letter from manufacturer or URL to manufacturer's specific web page confirming authorization as a reseller) that they are an authorized distributor.</p>
<p>An evaluation will be conducted based on best value, where delivery schedule offered, technical compliance as defined by staying as close to the listed specifications as identified, and past performance are more important than price. However, as delivery schedule, technical compliance, and past performance become equal, award will be made on the basis of lowest price. All unit rates should include all costs including shipping to Dunn Loring, VA 22027.</p>
<p>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to FAR 4.1102 and other applicable regulations and guidelines. Information can be found at www.sam.gov.</p>

<p>Title of Position:  	USPSC Education Specialist<br />Organizational Location of the Position:  Education Office, USAID/Mozambique<br />Direct Supervisor:  Supervisory Education Officer, USAID/Mozambique</p>
<p><br />A.	Introduction</p>
<p>Following a long colonial period, a 10 year war for independence, and 16 years of civil war, Mozambique is rebuilding its education sector and strengthening capacity to provide quality educational services. The Government of Mozambique's (GOM) overall development plan (PARP, 2010) reflects a long-term vision for the development of education, emphasizing the crucial role of education and training in creating the necessary human capital for sustained social and economic development as well as for peace keeping and democracy. The rapid expansion in access to primary education since the end of the civil war in 1992, however, has placed immense pressure on the education system, and consequently, school quality and learning achievement related to the basic skills - reading and math, have significantly deteriorated. The current situation calls for more effective management of resources with an emphasis on improving learning outcomes in the early grades, 1-3. In particular, challenges related to the quantity as well as the quality of instructional hours, and school management have resulted in plummeting standardized achievement test scores in reading and math (SACMEQ, 2007), and stagnating primary school completion rates (MINED, 2010).  Large disparities remain when it comes to gender equality; less than a third of girls complete primary school, with 54% of female pupils dropping out by 5th grade.  Between 2008 and 2009, completion rates declined from 50.9% to 47.9%, and particularly for girls from 43.5% to 42.1%. If left unchecked, the current decline in education quality may threaten Mozambique's ability to capitalize on opportunities for significant employment generation as well as overall social stability and national unity.<br /> <br />The US Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 2009-2014 identifies education as one of the priority goals "Expand opportunities for quality education and training." The Assistance Objective (AO) of the USAID/Mozambique Basic Education Program is responsive to this goal in that it aims to "improve learning outcomes through enhanced quality basic education services." This AO is premised on the hypothesis that USAID/Mozambique can best help the GOM enhance school quality in primary education by focusing on improving the quality and increasing the quantity of reading instruction, and by strengthening the GOM's institutional capacity to manage and provide quality early grade reading instruction in order to improve students' reading achievement.  Underlying this hypothesis is research that has demonstrated that "early grade reading competency is critical for continued retention and success in future grades" (Patrinos and Velez, 2009), and that basic reading skills are a critical support that is especially relevant for vulnerable children from low-income families.  "Children who do not attain reading skills at the primary level are on a lifetime trajectory of limited education progress and limited economic and development opportunity" (USAID Education Strategy, 2011).</p>
<p>During FY 2011, the final design of the education program was completed through a participatory assessment and design process.  Relevant implementation and procurement actions were completed to ensure start-up and implementation in FY2012.  Planned activities currently include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Early Grade Reading Assessment and School Management randomized control evaluation<br />&bull;	Training, coaching and support for in-service teachers and school directors to improve the quality and increase quantity of reading instruction. <br />&bull;	Strengthening community and civil society engagement in school management <br />&bull;	Identification and application of innovative approaches and appropriate communication technology for scaling up teacher training, school director professional development, and community engagement activities</p>
<p><br />B.	Scope of Work</p>
<p>B.1.    General Duties</p>
<p>The USPSC Education Specialist will have an important role within USAID/Mozambique to assist the Supervisory Education Development Officer in the implementation of the new Basic Education Program to expand opportunities for quality education and training.  The USPSC Education Specialist will assist in managing USAID/Mozambique educational initiatives and a growing portfolio that has been approved as one of three pilot countries of education.  The portfolio is expected to be in the range of $6-10 million per year.  S/he will help to achieve Mission objectives in this area and will assist with organizing all strategic and critical programming for the education sector. The incumbent will expand relationships and lead coordination efforts with bilateral and multilateral partners in the education sector, civil society organizations, and private sector partners.  The primary program-related responsibility of the USPSC Education Specialist is to provide assistance in developing, implementing, and monitoring the Basic Education Program that supports the Government of Mozambique's efforts to provide quality and equitable education services, and to harness and focus civil society and private sector participation in efforts to improve school quality and promote child protection and safe and healthy learning environments.  The incumbent will also be responsible for liaising with the USAID/Mozambique Integrated Health Office, especially the Mission's Gender Advisor and the Orphans and Vulnerable Children Program Specialist.

<p>The incumbent will be initially posted to the USAID/Mozambique Education Office in Maputo; however, s/he will travel to education project target areas up to 75 percent of the time to manage and support local implementing partners in the field and to coordinate with other education stakeholders.

<p>&bull; Order Tracking Analysis<br />The system shall be capable of performing order tracking analysis. It shall be able to synchronize the sampling of input signals to the instantaneous angular position of the machine shaft. A constant number of samples per revolution are required so that the analysis is in the order domain rather than the frequency domain as it would be if the data were digitized using a constant number of samples per second. Once the data is analyzed in the order domain, analysis displays such as revolution histories and order spectra shall be available. The user interface shall allow the user to specify the machine speed range, the highest order of interest for the analysis and the order resolution required.</p>
<p>&bull; Demodulation<br />Demodulation analysis shall allow for the measurement of the analytic or synchronous average signal in the time domain, as well as the auto power or synchronous average amplitude and phase modulation in the frequency domain. The system shall provide both amplitude and frequency/phase demodulation. The ability to zoom in on the bandwidth of interest accompanied by demodulation is necessary in order to get the resolution necessary in the area of interest. The system shall also provide the ability to combine this with synchronous averaging. The result provides a significant improvement on the signal to noise ratio by triggering the data acquisition relative to a single synchronous component.</p>
<p><br />Analysis of Stored Test Data<br />&bull; It shall be possible to review, analyze, extract, graph and print any type of stored test result data at any time without disturbing a running test.<br />&bull; The content of each selected result file should clearly show the date and time stamps, the channel identification information tags and other key information.<br />&bull; Graphics shall allow both single data display and overlays of at least 32 selected data displays for comparison.<br />&bull; Any number of integrations or differentiations shall be automatically applied to any data, if necessary, when the vertical display units are changed.<br />&bull; A peak cursor function shall produce a list of peak data.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study (Study) for smart grid upgrades to the electricity transmission network in Almaty, Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>AZHK provides electric power to a total population of 2.2 million in the city and region of Almaty through over 15,000 miles of transmission and distribution power lines and over 7,000 substations. Due to outdated equipment, AZHK experiences significant technical and commercial losses in excess of 19%. Electricity lost through poor billing and theft (commercial losses) and poor quality infrastructure (technical losses) represents costs for which there is no corresponding revenue. Furthermore, regulated transmission and distribution tariffs are calculated for line losses of 16.5%, so AZHK has considerable financial incentive to reduce line losses. In order to reduce these losses, AZHK plans to implement a modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, smart metering at large commercial customers, an outage management system (OMS), communications systems for distribution automation, and pilot smart metering for residential and small commercial customers. By increasing operational efficiency through better management, these changes would reduce technical losses. Commercial losses would be reduced through higher levels of required payment compliance and simplified grid connections.</p>
<p>This Feasibility Study will help to assess the technical, economic, and financial feasibility for implementing distribution automation technologies in the Almaty region.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation. (b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must: (1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; (2) Clearly identify the item by? (i) Brand name, if any; and (ii) Make or model number; (3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and (4) Clearly describe any modifications the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modifications. (c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an ?equal? product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>Question 1: The spec calls for a 40,000 rpm spindle capable of drilling 25mm, tapping M20 and machining 150cm3.  We believe this to be a specification that does not exist within the market for a machine this size, and therefore we believe there may be a typo.  We interpret high speed to be anything above 12,000 rpm.  Assuming this is the case for the specification and that 40,000 rpm is indeed required, can you ask the end user to re-examine their drilling tapping and machining requirements? Answer 1: The tapping, drilling and maching capacities listed in the technical specifications are those required for the base model.  The vendor will need to specify the changes in capacities for adding the high speed package.  Further, if the inclusion of the high speed package permanently changes the capacities of the base model, this fact would need to be stated. <BR> <BR>What is expected of a control - 3 axis at once is standard with positioning on the 4th and 5th axis, or up to 5 axis blending ? -Full 5-axis
What level of acceptance is needed using a Renishaw QC20W Ball Bar System that goes to the micron level ?  - ref:www.renishaw.com under calibration equipment.  -The QC20W is bluetooth wirelss and cannot be used in this facility.
What type work is proposed, engraving in 5 axis to general machine parts?  -Machine parts, injection molds, etc.
What are the qualifications of their personnel for training and do they have any computerized equipment currently in use?  The training period can not be open ended for infinity.  We will give 40 hours training to a qualified CNC machine tool operator. -Experienced CNC user.
Will a foundation be built for this machine as recommended by the builder. -No.
Is this machine restricted to 96" height for moving only or can it be assembled to be taller inside their facility? - 96" limit for installed machine.
Is a sub spindle attachment acceptable for high speed operations? -No.
Warranty is for one year for parts only.  Is this acceptable ? -No. <BR> <BR>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>CLIN 7&nbsp; UNDERWATER HULL PREPARATION AND COATING<br />QUESTION:<br />Item 7 Underwater hull preparation, coating, and inspection, paragraph 5.17.1.&nbsp; For the UWILD bolt ring fastener replacement are the sea chests included, or is it just the few overboards listed on the UWILD drawings?</p>

<p>VENDORS QUESTIONS WITH MARAD RESPONSES FOLLOW:<br />VENDOR QUESTION # 1: On page 25 of the specifications under paragraph 13 Hours of Work, it states that the hours of work will be 0700 hrs until 1700 hrs.&nbsp; In a dry-docking availability like this one ship yards usually have a limited second shift to ensure timely completion of all work.&nbsp; Is a second shift authorized? <br />MARAD RESPONSE #1:<br />The second shift needs to be identified as to number of hours and cost per hour and number of men and how they will be monitored (eg: Second shift foreman).&nbsp; The idea is that we want to have a fixed labor cost if at all possible at straight time rather than overtime or premium time payments.&nbsp; Vendor would need to&nbsp; show how the second shift is truly efficient and benefits the completion of the job.</p>
<p>VENDOR QUESTION #2: CLIN 004 Dry-docking. Is there a docking plan available in electronic for the bidders?<br />MARAD RESPONSE QUESTION #2:<br />The Dock plan was delivered along with most referenced plans at the Shipcheck/Pre-solicitation conference.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC> <br>  Below is an additional question submitted regarding special notice W31P4Q134DMDI and the Government's formal response that question. This does not in any way mean that the timeframe associated with asking questions is still open. The Government is only providing this response so that interested parties can proceed accordingly. All other guidelines and information listed within initial special notice W31P4Q134DMDI and modification 01 remain the same; including the 5:00 PM Central Standard Time, June, 06, 2013 submission deadline for formal RFI responses.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> 17. We would like to know whether it would be appropriate to submit more than <br> one application before the deadline of June 6th. I understand that each of the submissions should be less than 10 pages.  <br>  <br> Government response: Special notice W31P4Q134DMDI is not an application; it is a <br> Request for Information (RFI) on the technology tenets that should be considered <br> as a part of a possible DMDI institute.  Respondents can submit as many <br> responses to the RFI as they wish as long as all publicized RFI guidelines are followed.  <br> REMINDER: As noted in paragraph 2 of the initial RFI special notice, there is no potential for an award of funds from this RFI. <br>

The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept proposals as a result of this Industry Day.  White papers will only be accepted in response to the formally issued BAA.  This notice shall not be construed as a promise to contract or commitment of any kind.  The Government will not award a contract resulting from this Industry Day Notification.

<DESC>Due to the nature and complexity of the work expected to be completed under the Multi-Award-Contract-Multi-Order (MAC-MO) pilot program in San Diego (N00024-13-R-4408), the Government currently expects the solicitation to require offerors to have, or be able to attain before award, a Master Ship Repair Agreement (MSRA) to be eligible for award.
 
To support small businesses, the Government intends to include a significant small business sub-contracting goal in the pilot procurement.  Additionally, the Government intends to look for additional opportunities to both award MAC contracts to ABRs and expand small business set-aside opportunities if the MAC-MO pilot is successful and is implemented Nation-wide.
  

Thus, non-MSRA holders are encouraged to attend the Industry Day to learn more about the proposed strategy from the perspective of a sub-contractor or as a potential future prime contractor as well as to provide feedback to the Government.

Following the Industry Day, the Government intends to post the Government presentation and a transcription of Industry questions and Government responses.

<DESC><p>**** 1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The Charleston District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires the services of Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms for a minimum of one and a maximum of three multi-discipline Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC). This solicitation is to pre-qualify a short list of firms that will be asked to submit price proposals.</p>
<p>The Charleston District serves a wide variety of customers, within South Carolina, throughout the US and overseas. These A/E contracts are to provide a wide variety of A/E design services, and will be used primarily for the support of the DLA Distribution program, but may also provide services for other federal customers within the Charleston District Area of Responsibility.</p>
<p>The IDC contract is as follows:<br />Multi-discipline A/E firm to support CONUS/OCONUS work. The anticipated contract will provide for a full range of planning, architectural, engineering, program management, and construction management (Title II) support services to support the network of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Defense Distribution Centers at all CONUS and OCONUS locations. Potential projects may include: inventory and definitive facility assessments; comprehensive planning; project planning; space utilization studies; interior design; energy studies, fire protection system testing and analysis; facility engineering investigations and; preparation of facility renovation and repair project design documents. The contracts will support the DLA Distribution facility design, construction, program management, project management, and construction management mission. Experience with facility related engineered management systems (EMS) software such as Builder or a similar facility inventory and assessment system is essential. Projects may be for a single facility, the repair/rehabilitation and/or new construction of a single facility and/or a large group of facilities. Design task orders could range from very small less than $25K to million dollar multi-building projects. This will be used primarily for DLA Distribution, but could be used for other Charleston District customers as well for equivalent types of work. Total contract limit of $9,900,000.00</p>

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 09 - 249 - Murfreesboro, TN is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

The potential value associated with the design/build construction services mandates this notice; "One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements."

<DESC>NASA Langleys Research Directorate (RD) conducts research and develops advanced technology to support the research and technology objectives of NASAs Aeronautics Research Mission, Human Exploration and Operations Mission, Space Technology Program, and Science Mission.  Flight Critical Systems Research addresses aviation systems technology gaps that are exposed by the operational challenges of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), trans-atmospheric flight, and extra-terrestrial planetary flight.  Such operations are characterized by increasing complexity and innerconnectivity; distributed control; system of systems, continuous vehicle health management; remote-piloting and autonomy (e.g., unmanned aircraft systems operations); blurring of system boundaries; escalating and ubiquitous automation and computing; and increasing verification, validation, and certification challenges. The Contractor shall conduct basic and applied research, technology development, and systems analyses in airborne and ground-based systems critical to flight safety, management, and control in the areas of crew systems and aviation operations, situation awareness  air traffic control (ATC), requirements for human subject Experimentation, Safety-Critical Aviation Systems, Design Integrity, System safety assurance, operational integrity, and flight critical systems analysis and assessment.

<DESC><p>Oshkosh Corporation, Oshkosh, Wis. is being awarded an estimated $192,852,826 firm-fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract under Contract No. M67854-13-D-0214 for the procurement of P-19R Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) vehicles, support and sustainment, to replace the current fleet of Truck, Firefighting, Aircraft Crash and Structure Fire, A/S32 P-19A for the United States Marine Corps.</p>
<p>The Marine Corps P-19A Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting Vehicle Replacement (P-19R) addresses the shortcomings of the P-19A (i.e. - NFPA 414, fording, mobility). It will be equipped with fire suppression compounds, handheld extinguishers, and tools required to extinguish aircraft fires, protect rescue personnel, cool explosive ordnance, and extract aircrews. The P-19R will seat a four man crew, be transportable aboard ship borne carriers, and meet off road mobility requirements. This program will replace P-19As at both Tactical (MWSS) and Garrison Mobile Equipment (GME) (Bases and Station) units. The scope of this contract covers the development and procurement of at least one test article, up to 164 production vehicles, engineering, testing, training, and logistics support required to fulfill the needs of the United States Marine Corps.</p>
