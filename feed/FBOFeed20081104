<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to solicit on an other than full and open competition basis a requirement for the renewal of Sentia Senturion Software Licenses, maintenance, and training to support the Joint Warfare Analysis Center.  The procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Sentia Group for this requirement.  The software licenses are to be procured on a sole source basis as only Senturion software is compatible with existing/in-process JWAC models.  The Joint Warfare Analysis Center has been creating models specifically using Senturion software since FY2005 (including ongoing forecasts and models).  The JWAC has presented these models to its customers and Senturion software allows specific analysis for JWAC's customers ! that could not be accomplished via any other means.  Senturion Software applies social science-based theories of human interactions to provide insight into complex decision making processes and allows an analyst to forecast the outcome of the decision making process identifying possible influence options/course of action to affect the outcome.  Changing to any other forecasting/modeling software would require the reworking of existing/in-process analyses to incorporate the new forecasting/modeling software. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by the specified response date.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, the Government will consider information received by the specified response date.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Governme! nt not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.  The NAICS code is 511210 and the small business size standard is $25M.

The mission of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to protect public health and safeguard the environment of the United States.  As a member office of the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE), the Office of Inspector General, Office of Investigations (OIG/OI) supports this mission as it manages, sets policy, coordinates, and has overall responsibility for criminal investigations of allegations of: 
1. financial fraud involving procurement, contractors, grantees, and other recipients of Agency funds; 
2. criminal wrongdoing involving Agency employees and programs, laboratory fraud, and computer crimes; and 
3. computer forensic examinations and media analysis to identify, investigate, and help counter illegal intrusions into EPA's computer systems. 
The OIG/OI seeks acquisition and installation of undercover lights and sirens and Motorola XTVA Open-Face Mini-U vehicular adapters and associated equipment as stated in the requirements sections below.
The following document outlines, at a minimum, the required items and services for this acquisition, delivery/installation time and  location of work, award criteria, and any special requirements relating to this action.  
Please provide a fixed price quotation of all proposed costs for delivery/installation, terms of warranty on the items and installation.
Award of a fixed price Purchase Order is anticipated by the Government.  Quotations shall be evaluated using "best-value" approach.  All evaluation factors, including price, shall be considered equally.  Evaluation factors are: 1) The ability to deliver and/or install undercover lights, sirens, radio vehicular adapters and antennas in vehicles (as applicable) in an area within approximately a 60 mile drive from where the vehicles are garaged; 2) In order to reduce downtime of the vehicles, the ability to install radio equipment and lights and siren equipment at the same time; 3) Recognition by Motorola as an authorized Motorola Product Reseller and installer; 4) Terms of warranty on equipment and installation.	 
REQUIREMENT
PART I: MOTOROLA XTVA OPEN-FACE MINI-U VEHICULAR ADAPTER AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT
*Note: "Brand-Name -Purchases" - This requirement for Motorola Brand-Name items is made in accordance with of FAR Part 13.106 (b)(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization)."
Justification for Motorola Brand-Name Purchase
Motorola portable radios (XTS 5000) are currently in use by OIG/OI Field Investigators.  The purchase of Motorola brand radio accessories, specifically compatible with existing radios is justified in order to meet the Continuity of Operations, reliability and safety requirements of working in a dynamic environment.  If vehicular adapters manufactured by other companies were purchased, existing radios would need to be replaced.  This would cause great and undue expense to the Government.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for Navigation and Timekeeping Technology. 

In concert with the guidance promulgated by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense National Information Infrastructure (ASD - NII), concerning NAVWAR, which deals with the mitigation of denial of Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), this effort is concerned with the first two of the three elements:  Electronic Protection (EP) and Electronic Support (ES). Please note that this effort does not address Electronic Attack (EA). 
  
Precision navigation and timekeeping are essential for many modern naval and maritime systems, and it is essential that navigation and timekeeping services be made available to platforms and weapons at the highest level of accuracy and with the highest possible confidence at reasonable cost.  Lack of precise navigation and timekeeping technologies may jeopardize the success of military operations.  For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate position/time information at low cost and, due to this, GPS has become the technology of choice for many users.  Unfortunately, the GPS signal is a low-power signal that is susceptible to interference. Therefore there is a need for (1) affordable approaches to make GPS more reliable/robust, and (2) methods of quantifying threats to GPS performance that may be termed situational awareness and (3) affordable and reliable precision navigation/timing alternatives to GPS.   
  
In the past eight years, ONR has been conducting a series of Science and Technology Projects in the following three technology areas; GPS Anti-Jam Technology, Precision Time and Time Transfer Technology, and Non-GPS Navigation Technology.  

In FY2010, the ONR Navigation and Timekeeping Technology Program seeks new and innovative navigation technologies that will provide more accurate, reliable, maintainable and affordable systems for Naval air, surface, subsurface, and ground platforms and forces.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Solicitation No.: GS-02P-08-DTC-0011, Project No.: NNY04002.  The Public Buildings Service of the United States General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast & Caribbean Region, New York, NY, announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in providing construction services for the New US Land Port of Entry at Alexandria Bay, NY. The address of the project is 46735 Interstate 81, Alexandria Bay, NY 13607.  With this Pre-invitation Notice the Government is releasing a Draft Request for Proposals for comments and questions.  All questions and comments concerning the Draft RFP are due by 7:00 AM, November 12, 2008 and shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.  The selected GC will be required to supply all labor, materials and supervision to perform the complete services as will be required by the resultant contract. The Estimated Construction Cost for this project ranges from $130,000,000 to $150,000,000.  The current Alexandria Bay Land Port of Entry was constructed in the early 1970s and no longer meets the traffic volumes or mission needs of the tenant agencies.  The port is located on the northern end of Interstate 81 on Wellesley Island in the Thousand Islands Region of New York State. Tenant agencies of the facility are Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Food and Drug Administration, USDA-APHIS Veterinary Services, and the General Services Administration. The project includes complete replacement of the existing facility with the construction of 98,275 gsf of buildings including a new administration building, seven (7) new non-commercial inspection lanes, new non-commercial secondary inspection building, new commercial building, seven (7) new primary commercial inspection lanes (split level booths that can be used for cars also), two (2) new non-intrusive inspection buildings, eight (8) secondary commercial dock bays, and a new veterinary services building.  This project will expand the existing site significantly. The new facility area will increase from approximately 10 acres to approximately 35 acres. A new circulation pattern throughout the facility will increase queuing and will allow safe and secure processing of current and future increased traffic volume entering from Canada. Additionally, future expandability and flexibility will be integrated in the facility design. Significant quantities of rock removal are required in order to develop the site. The construction of this project will take place around the existing port of entry operations which will be a continuous 24 hours, 7 days a week effort. This acquisition process will include two (2) Stages.  It is the Governments intention that at the conclusion of Stage 1 up to three (3) contracts will be issued purchase orders to provide design review and related services that they will accomplish during Stage 2.  Only the offerors receiving purchase orders for design review services will progress to Stage 2 of this acquisition.  Stage 2 of the Acquisition Process will progress as the Architect-Engineer firm (A/E) designs the construction documents (specifications and drawings) for this project.  At the conclusion of Stage 2 and based upon technical and price proposal evaluation the Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract to one (1) of the three (3) remaining offerors.  The contractor selected at the conclusion of Stage 2 will provide the construction services for the new port of entry.  Contract awards are based upon the availability of Government funding. At the conclusion of this acquisition process, the Government anticipates an award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract for the following services: Construction of a New U.S. Land Port of Entry at Alexandria Bay, NY.  The Government anticipates the release of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Construction of the New U.S. Land Port of Entry, Alexandria Bay, NY on or about November 17, 2008.

<a href="mailto:Jeanne.Rossetsky@volpe.dot.gov">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovation Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) intends to award a contract, based on a sole source procurement, to The Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis (ITS-DAVIS) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and no other type of services will satisfy agency requirements.  This proposed action is for commercial supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under statutory authority 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from the solicitation that offers best value considering both cost and technical offering.  The Volpe Center intends to Purchase Studies, Reports and Modeling Analysis conducted under the Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways (STEPS), being performed by the University of California at Davis (UC Davis), Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS).  This combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items is prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Subpart 12.6, Acquisition of Commercial Items; FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation; and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27 dated October 17, 2008.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) code for this requirement is 813211 and the small business size standard is $6.5M.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is a request for proposal; no other solicitation will be issued.  
Statement of Work (BEGIN):  Background:  `Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways? (STEPS), through a four-year research and outreach program will address the technical, operational, and logistical issues related to the transition to an alternative fuel-based economy.  The goals of the STEPS program are to inform the public debate and to assist the public and private sponsors by providing tools and knowledge concerning sustainable transportation alternatives.  The program will carefully analyze potential transitions in the transportation sector by addressing markets and consumer behavior, engineering and economics of vehicles and fuel infrastructure systems, societal and lifecycle environmental impacts (climate change, air quality, energy security), and public policy.  The intent is to generate a strong understanding and solid foundation of knowledge for companies and Government agencies analyzing technology, investment and policy questions.  The overarching objectives of the STEPS program are: to develop the theory, tools, and methods that allow for self-consistent and transparent comparisons of promising alternative energy and vehicle pathways; and to apply these tools and methods in comparative assessments of four general transportation energy pathways ? hydrogen, biofuels, electricity and fossil fuels.  The contractor is uniquely positioned through its partnership with organizations which include major energy companies, automotive companies, and Government agencies.  The contractor will draw upon research methods from a broad range of academic fields, including vehicle engineering and design, systems analysis and operations research, chemical and mechanical engineering, lifecycle cost and emissions analysis, market research, sociology and anthropology, economics and business strategy, and policy and political analysis.  The focus will be on understanding transitions toward a more sustainable transportation system. The evolving transportation system will not rely on one solution (such as hydrogen and fuel cells). The contractor will take a systems view of the emergence of multiple technologies, gaining insight into transition scenarios and will consider both near-term and long-term technologies to analyze possible paths forward.  Key issues include understanding how one technology path can enable another and how multiple technologies can be either synergistic or competitive.  The contractor will engage industry, government and other partners in developing this alternative vehicle and fuel evaluation and disseminate all research findings in the form of studies, reports and modeling analyses.  This goal is to be achieved in a variety of ways, including: The preparation and distribution of publications and applicable documents on key issues and topics; and an ongoing series of specially designed workshops that will engage and educate program members, public officials, and key agency leaders on the issues of transition to an alternative fuel-based transportation system.  Scope of Work (Pooled Fund Study):   Four main transportation energy categories will be investigated, and interdisciplinary projects will study the differences between specific energy-vehicle pathways.  All research projects will be conducted in parallel and remain active throughout the program.  All research among energy categories will be coordinated with continuous feedback among them.  The following fuel tracks:  HYDROGEN.  Research conducted under the Hydrogen Pathways Program will continue, exploring new areas such as hydrogen/electricity systems, conducting regional transition case studies, understanding the impact of alternative policies, and enhancing key hydrogen pathways models for infrastructure development strategies.  BIOFUELS.  This track will build upon the contractor?s current work within the California Biomass Collaborative and the considerable agricultural and biological expertise of the university.  The biofuels track will include analysis of various biorefinery production systems, infrastructure strategies, environmental & land-use impacts, & vehicle analysis.  ELECTRICITY.  Electricity production methods, total grid capacity, and time-of-day charging impacts on the utility sector will be studied.  Additionally, research will be conducted on consumer behavior and preferences for electric drive attributes, including all-electric range and charging time.  FOSSIL FUELS.  This track includes both cases where petroleum-based fuels continue to dominate transportation energy, and the evolution of fuels produced from other fossil fuel resources, including tar sands, oil shale, and coal with carbon sequestration.  Expanded use of diesel fuel will also be studied.  STEPS Comparative Research Methods:  Making consistent comparative analyses among different energy and vehicle pathways is a major analytic task.  This becomes increasingly challenging when accounting for factors such as market dynamics (including consumer choices and strategic behavior of firms), technological change, geographic location, and infrastructure interactions.  To deal with these complexities, the STEPS program will involve three types of comparative analysis:  Transition Analysis - Study the dynamics of long-term transitions in the transportation sector with the intent of understanding how transitions might occur with minimal private sector investment risk and maximum public benefits; Systems Integration - Conduct comparative analyses that involve integration of technologies into complete systems, incorporating geography, resource availability, market dynamics, public policy, and interactions with other parts of the energy system; and, Comparison Metrics - Generate data and enhance the models to facilitate self-consistent metrics for comparing costs, emissions, energy use, and vehicle performance.  These analyses will be applied within each of the four tracks and for comparisons between tracks as appropriate.  
Deliverables: The contractor will issue publications and reports each year to all participants on the progress of the ongoing studies. The U.S. DOT / Volpe Center will have the opportunity to provide feedback on draft reports.  Quarterly newsletters shall be issued by the contractor to U.S. DOT / Volpe Center highlighting the current research projects.  Refer to the reporting section below.  The contractor will conduct at least one high-level, invitation-only conference annually to provide a review of the research outputs from the program.  In addition, a program review of recent related technology and policy developments related to alternative fuel infrastructure and use in the transportation sector will be provided by the contractor to the U.S. DOT / Volpe Center.  The conference will be exclusively for participants, invited technical experts, and senior Government and public interest organization leaders. The materials from each conference will be distributed to the U.S. DOT / Volpe Center electronically and on an annual compilation CD that shall be furnished by the contractor.  The U.S. DOT / Volpe Center will be allocated a seat on the contractor?s STEPS Advisory Board that will meet to review the status of the ongoing studies annually.  The contractor will hold at least one invitation-only research workshop annually on critical technical issues and topics. These workshops are intended for technical experts, researchers, program managers, and others with a strong interest in the topics.  These workshops will be exclusively for program members and invited technical experts.  The materials from each conference will be distributed to the U.S. DOT / Volpe Center electronically and on an annual compilation CD that shall be furnished by the contractor.  Each year at least one special public process event will be held by the contractor.  These may include tutorial workshops for public agency leaders and staff, policy issue forums, and information gathering sessions requested by public agencies.  Tutorial materials will be developed for each workshop.  The materials from each conference will be distributed to all program members via the program website and an annual compilation CD.  The U.S. DOT / Volpe Center will be provided the opportunity to participate in near-term pilot projects facilitated by or perhaps led by the contractor.  The period of performance for this procurement will be from date of award through December 31, 2008, Option Year 1 will be from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009, and Option Year 2 will run from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010.
Reporting:  On a monthly basis, the U.S. DOT / Volpe Center will be provided with all materials generated during the month including publications, meeting notices, agendas, meeting minutes of the above deliverable events, presentations from the events, reports, etc.  Quarterly updates will be submitted to the U.S. DOT / Volpe Center (in electronic formats including Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint), highlighting current research projects and developments within the STEPS program.  A final review of the year?s research will be issued at the end of each calendar year.  This will be distributed by both electronic format (MS Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and hard-copy.  No other such venue offers the Volpe Center?s Alternative Fuels and Hydrogen Program the ability to reach such a highly specialized audience and perform such unbiased, relevant research in-line with the program?s goals.  Providing access to this audience affords the Alternative Fuels and Hydrogen Program the ability to carry out is objectives in a targeted, cost-efficient manner.   Statement of Work (END).

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Advanced Initiative Training (AIT), Basic Training (BT) Barracks and Warrior in Transition (WIT) Barracks in the Northeast Region (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, H, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV).<BR><BR>The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be David L. Hancock, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at David.l.Hancock@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been requested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training (AIT), Basic Training (BT) Barracks and Warrior in Transition (WIT) Barracks, or other similar facilities:  <BR><BR>Advanced Individual Training Complexes:<BR>AIT complexes are comprised of multiple facilities, consisting of Barracks/Company Operations Facilities (BCOF), Dining Facilities (DFAC), Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ), Support Facilities, and Outdoor Areas.  AIT Complexes are designed as training facilities.  AIT Complexes will be programmed as a unit, rather than as individual facilities as the complete battalion drives the overall functionality of the facility.  Included are functional, operational, and spatial relationships critical to meeting battalion training requirements which are embedded in the operational layout of the facilities.  All facility types will meet DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, latest edition.<BR><BR>The BCOF is comprised of sleeping, latrine, classrooms, storage, and company operations components.  As the BCOF is designed for able-bodied soldiers, the facility is not required to meet ADA compliance.  Each two-person living suite has a minimum population of two and may be increased to a maximum population of three to accommodate population surges.<BR><BR>The DFAC is will be procured through Norfolk District contracts. <BR><BR>The BN HQ facility will be procured through the Fort Worth District under separate solicitation action.<BR><BR>The AIT Site includes Outside Areas such as; a jogging track, physical training (PT) pits, vehicular and service access drives and parking areas.

Child care areas, financial assistance, meeting rooms, kitchenette, chaplain and other assistance type functions to accommodate both the soldier and their families are provided in this facility.   <BR><BR>All of the WIT facilities together form a complex and provides a cohesive mission in the healing process of the soldier.  The Government reserves the right to solicit this facility type separately, if determined to be in the best interests of the Government, through approval of an amendment to the acquisition plan.  It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.  <BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.

The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR><BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; and Sustainability Requirements.

Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  Once the contracts under this solicitation are awarded and there is duplicative coverage for this facility type in the same region, any requirement less than $15 million will be evaluated first for advertisement under any set-aside contract or pool of contracts prior.  The Government will consider the current workload under the set-aside contract, performance on previous task orders, and the small business firms ability to obtain additional boding prior to making a determination.  <BR><BR>The total estimated contract capacity is $192,500,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 5,000.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.  The minimum task order limitation is $15,000,000.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $75,000,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $100,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price.  <BR><BR>The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   HUBZone Set-Aside Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Administrative Facilities Northeast Region (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, H, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV )<BR><BR>The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be David L. Hancock, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail to David.l.Hancock@usace.army.mil.<BR><BR>FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WIT) barracks and all related Administrative Buildings and Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses. The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Administrative Facilities - The scope consists of but is not limited to the following administrative facilities as separate or combined tasks:<BR><BR>The Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ) facility is comprised of administration, special functions, storage and classroom components for personnel assigned to work in those facilities.  The BN HQ is where visitors can be received and entry into the complex controlled and has a clear and convenient pedestrian access to the Barracks/Company Operations Facility (BCOFs) and Dining Facility (DFAC).  BN HQ facilities shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for Buildings and Facilities.  BN HQs will have private offices.  The BN HQ facility will provide a staff duty station at the building entrance/reception area.  Every HQ BN will provide a Secure Communications Room with a Secret Internet Protocol Router network (SIPRNET) connectivity in accordance with latest criteria.<BR><BR>The administrative building function is to provide soldier mission direction and operational needs requirements.  This facility will operate in a similar manner as the Battalion and Brigade headquarters facilities and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to an office building.<BR><BR>The Soldier Family Assistance Center (SFAC) serves as a transitional facility, which bridges the gap between in the transition between family assistance and assisting the soldier in personal adjustments.  Soldier assistance by family members is critical element in the recovery from injuries.  Child care areas, financial assistance, meeting rooms, kitchenette, chaplain and other assistance type functions to accommodate both the soldier and their families are provided in this facility.   <BR><BR>It is the intent of Government to issue design-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region, i.e., adapt-build and/or as fully-designed RFP/task orders.<BR><BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR><BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror(s), whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR><BR>The following technical evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation:  Phase 1  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase 2  Volume I:  Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:   Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  <BR><BR>Solicitation W9126G-09-R-0012 is estimated to issue on or about 17 Nov 2008.    Phase 1 proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 8 Dec 2008 (21 days from issuance of the solicitation).

<DESC>Request for Information.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS). The intent of this RFI is to locate sources capable of completing the total destruction of demilitarization (Demil) required Department of Defense property, including the accountability, control, storage, and security of property. The requirement for management of the Demil required property includes providing a certification (can be an approved contractor) that demilitarization has been accomplished and a Government employee who countersigns, as a verifier, that demil has been accomplished.  Demil required property must be destroyed to prevent the offensive or defensive capability of certain types of equipment or materials and to the point that the item can no longer be recognized or rebuilt for its originally intended purpose.  

 	Purpose.  The DRMS is looking for a facility that has the operational capability to input up to 8 x 8 foot items and destroy to residue no larger than 4 x 4 inches.  The process must be able to pulverize cast iron, cast aluminum and magnesium and be capable of processing no less than 130,000 lbs per day, such as can be accomplished by hammer mill technology.   Any items that cannot be processed as above (due to size or metal thickness, such as heavy armor plate) may be processed by torch or shear.    Precision cutting tools of any kind are strictly unauthorized for Demil required property.   Examples of metallic demil required property may include:  engines and engine parts, weapon parts, electric generators, aircraft, armor, vehicles and vehicle parts, tanks, hulls, and skirts.  Non-metallic may include:  camouflage nets, plastic bomb components, vest, military uniforms, helmets, parachutes.  The requirement will include office space, with computer capability,  for Government employees (number to be determined) and warehouse space for Government employees to perform inspection and receipt of incoming property and inventory of property prior to demilitarization.  The requirement may also include storage of demil required property for screening (up to 42 days) by DOD activities or other authorized entities for reuse before destruction.   After screening, property requested for reuse must be retrieved from storage, packed, and shipped to the requisitioning office.   Accountability of all property must be maintained to satisfy property management requirements.

 	Submission Requirement.   Interested parties are encouraged to respond with an information paper of no more than twenty (20) pages. The information paper should include, but is not limited to:  capability to perform Demil as stated above, location, security measures that would be implemented, material handling equipment available, method(s) of Demil, i.e., hammer mill, shredder, shears, plasma cutters, etc.   The location where Demil would be performed must include a location in the Continental United States (CONUS) that can process according to the capabilities stated above, and receive secure trucks from multiple geographic locations.    Please submit information that would allow DRMS to review and assess your companys capability to meet the demil requirements as described above.  The Government seeks to reduce its transportation cost from several centralized Demil centers to a major Demil center or to east coast/west coast located Demil centers.  Also please submit information on your business size under the identified NAICs code for this RFI.   

 	RFI Not a Solicitation for a Contract.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of DRMS to acquire any products or services.  The DRMS does not intend to award a contract based on this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested as submission of a response to this RFI is strictly voluntary.   All information and data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected and held in strict confidence.

Questions.  Questions may be directed to Marlene Weishuhn, DRMS Centralized Demil Centers Program Manager, Phone 269-961-7461, and Fax: 269-961-4047, Email: marlene.weishuhn @dla.mil.  Information may be submitted in writing or by email within 30 calendar days of this announcement.  Information received after the 30 calendar day deadline may not be reviewed.

<a href="mailto:pamela.nevels@amedd.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3 (OCT 1997) and is published only to encourage interested parties to gather information about commercially available products that meet or can be readily modified to meet the requirements discussed below.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.<BR><BR>1.  BACKGROUND:  The Air Force Medical Evaluation Support Activity (AFMESA) is conducting market research on an ancillary test result reporting system (ATRS) for automated reporting of patient test results.  Responses are due to this Request for Information (RFI) by Monday, November 17, 2008; 4:00:00 P.M.  Eastern Standard Time (EST).<BR><BR>2.  DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI.  Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future Request For Proposal (RFP), as well as those regarding the nature of the services to be performed under any future ancillary test reporting system initiative, will not be entertained.<BR><BR>All interested, capable, and responsible sources that wish to respond to this RFI are encouraged to submit documentation on their specific capabilities.  In addition to relevant and relative capability statements, past performance, and other information, the Government requests responses to provide, as a minimum, the following:<BR><BR>1) Title Page: The capability package must be assembled with a title page containing the following information: Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, DUNS number, and business size  please include any socioeconomic information.<BR><BR>2) Experience: Offeror to provide prior/current experience of similar size and scope, including contract number, organization supported, indicate whether a prime or subcontractor, contract value, and Government or commercial point of contact with current telephone number and E-mail address.<BR>Reponses to this RFI will not be returned.<BR><BR>3. BACKGROUND: Accrediting agencies, such as the Joint Commission and the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC), require timely patient notification of all clinically significant or abnormal test results; similarly, the Air Force Medical Service mandates that Air Force members be notified of all Periodic Health Assessment (PHA) test results.  Automated test result retrieval systems can facilitate these requirements.<BR><BR>A prompt and comprehensive ancillary test result reporting system is essential for optimal preventative care and application of appropriate therapeutic measures imperative to maintaining patient safety.  This capability directly supports the 2008 Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment Reports Focused Shortfall List where maintaining patient safety is the number one priority.  This node comprises timeliness, accuracy, and thoroughness of records/documentation, staff communication, and a preventative approach to patient claims.  Currently, individual notification by calling or mailing test result messages is a very time intensive process.  Furthermore, because the priority is to notify patients on abnormal results, patients with normal results may not be notified in a timely manner, if at all.  These performance gaps result in an AFMS ancillary test reporting process that is very inefficient, time-consuming, and sub-optimal in terms of patient safety standards which indicate that patient care is enhanced when patients are notified of test results in a timely manner.  <BR><BR>4.  REQUIREMENTS: The AFMS ATRS will provide an automated test result notification system that can operate from a website and through a toll free phone system.  The capability should allow for a patient to be notified of available results and then be able to retrieve the test results by logging into a secure website or using a toll free phone number.  The system should contact patients to remind them to get their results if they have not done so.  It should also furnish a patient contact report to a provider on request.  Having an application in place that allows staff to enter (or via interface) test results would save hours of time daily and free up staff for other essential patient care activities.<BR><BR>4A. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS: The following are the top-level requirement for the AFMS ATRS system.<BR><BR>1.	The AFMS ATRS will provide a web-based system for ancillary test result notification. <BR><BR>2.	The AFMS ATRS will provide an automated, toll-free, telephonic system for ancillary test result notification.<BR><BR>3.	The system will be interoperable with other MHS software systems to include AHLTA and Composite Health Care System (CHCS).<BR><BR>4.	The system will provide for the integrity of the data when the data is retrieved and used by the end-user and when it is accessed in a shared data environment through such techniques as a unique patient identifier, use of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) enabling, and use of a secure web site.<BR><BR>5.	The system will provide the capability to automatically send notifications of incomplete test results and send reminders for future tests.<BR><BR>6.	The system will be capable of generating user defined reports such as no-shows for tests and patient notification reports.<BR><BR>7.	The system will be compliant with current AF operating system and software requirements policy and run on a standard desktop configuration.<BR><BR>8.	The system support must include initial and follow-on training along with appropriate training materials.<BR><BR>9.	The system support must include a helpdesk support function.<BR><BR>10.	The system shall be Net Ready and compliant with requirements levied by the Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP), Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other sensitive data protections levied by the Privacy Act, Department of Defense, USAF, and AFMS directives.<BR><BR>11.	Offeror to provide detail technical/functionality information concerning their system, warranty, maintenance information and estimated cost.<BR><BR>5.  POINT OF CONTACT INFORMATION: Response to this RFI must be addressed to Contract Specialist Myrsonia Lutz, via E-mail ONLY at Myrsonia.Lutz@us.army.mil (limit up to 20 pages when printed).  Response must be received by this office on or before 4:00:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time (EST) local time on November 17, 2008.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted, or for any costs associated with providing the information. <BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Market Research Survey / Request for Information


BACKGROUND:

The Department of Defense- Education Activity (DoDEA) is conducting a market survey to gather interest level in the private sector relating to A-76 public / private competitions between the government and the private sector for logistics (maintenance/ custodial/ transportation) functions located at two field sites in Puerto Rico.  

DoDEA provides education to primarily DoD military and civilian eligible dependents from preschool through grade 12 with two distinct programs: the Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS) and Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS).  The focus of DoDEA is to provide quality education to all eligible students.

Though DoDEAs responsibilities are education related, they must rely on support from various entities to keep the schools up and running.  These support groups include logistics related services that provide:

	Minor maintenance and repair on school buildings (including carpentry, welding, HVAC, electrical, and plumbing)
	Motor vehicle operations (School bus driving and special needs bus driving [handicap])
	Custodial / janitorial services at schools.  

There are approximately five buildings (four schools, one office building) that require the aforementioned services.  One school is located around the northwestern shores in Aguadilla (about 75 miles west of San Juan) known as Ramey School; the other buildings (three schools (Antilles elementary, middle, high) & one office building) are located in the San Juan, PR vicinity at Fort Buchanan.  Hours of operation will consist of primarily normal business hours (8 hours between 0600 & 1700), with the exception of motor vehicle operations which may require post-business hours (or separated hours per workday - i.e., morning / afternoon / evening shift)) for special transportation services such as sporting events and school educational trips. Ability to perform the described services and location (Puerto Rico) are the primary concerns at this point.  We are NOT asking for a proposal.

Page two contains some statistical information regarding the buildings where this work is performed. 

Any resulting competition that may follow will fall under the guidelines described in the revised OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003.  The basic premise of this market research is to gauge the interest level in the private sector as well as to solicit ideas and opinions from the private sector.  Your participation in this market research and a prompt response by Friday November 14th, 2008 is appreciated and valuable to the process.  Thank You.

Survey Questions are stated on page three.

<DESC>Special Notice:

The White Mountain National Forest is conducting a site visit for a potential road re-surfacing project.  If funds are available, this project is expected to be advertised in the first quarter of 2009.  Due to weather conditions it would not be feasible to have a site visit at that time.

Descripton of Project:  Placement of 1 1/2 inches of crushed bank run gravel on areas of the Wild River and Little Lary roads that were damaged during a flood event.  

Estimated cost is between $250,000 and $500,000.  

Project Location:  Off Maine State Highway 113.  Wild River Road is about 3 miles south of the junction of US-2 and State Highway 113.  Little Lary is about 3.6 miles south of the junction of US-2 and State Highway 113.

Site Visit:  Interested parties should meet at the Southern Gate on Maine State Highway 113 at 9:00 am ET on November 18, 2008.  Travel will be from the South on 113 because the North Gate is currently closed.  A map is attached.  More information about the project will be disseminated at this meeting, however attendance is not mandatory.  For more information about meeting location, please contact Jon Jakubos at 603-447-5448 extension 132.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Field Intelligence Group LA intends to award a sole source contract for the procurment of secured, reserved parking spaces at its present location at 1 World Trade Center, Long Beach, CA. Additional parking is required to accommodate additional field agents that will be re-locating to this address as part of a multi-unit task force. Due to the nature of their work and the equipment and weapons that they carry, the parking must be secured, and accessible from their office building. It is not desirable for the agents to be required to walk down public streets carrying their field gear and weapons. Also, the vehicles requiring the additional parking are specially equipped with proprietary equipment that necessitates them being parked in a secured, controlled access lot. The recepient vendor is able to provide all the required needs of vehicle security, and private accessiblity by the agents.

<DESC>CECOM Contracting Center-Washington, Army Contracting Command intends to, on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis, extend the period of performance until 30 Dec 2009 on Contract DAAB15-02-D-1007 with Radian Inc, for the acquisition of the Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System (ICIDS-III). This extension is required to allow for sufficient time for the follow-on to be awarded.  This Other Than Full and Open Competition extension is based upon the statutory authority of 10 USC 23049(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source.<BR><BR>The ICIDS-III is an automated Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that uses color graphic displays, keyboards, computers and printers to respond to interior/exterior sensors, and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) and entry control devices that monitor designated areas and facilities on and around an installation. This equipment enables detection of any unauthorized attempts to enter an installation, and activates alarms to alert operators to take appropriate action. The ICIDS-III consists of integrated commercial hardware and software components. These components vary in quantity and type depending on the level of protection required, physical construction of an area or facility, size and environmental characteristics of the installation, quantity of existing IDSs, and the number and location of vulnerability areas that require physical security protection. <BR><BR>Radian is the only responsible source that has an available, tested and approved IDS that meets the Governments requirements.  Any other source would require comprehensive Government testing, inspection and approval of its IDS before installation of the IDS could commence. Production, First Article Test, fix and retest would take up to 13 months to complete, and system installation itself then takes between 10-18 months. No source other than Radian was identified that could meet the Governments requirements for installations of the ICIDSs prior to December 2009.<BR><BR>Any responsible source that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the required services may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency. Responses should be no longer than five pages and provided in a Microsoft Word compatible document. All responses are to be in writing and received by email within 15 days of this notice and no later than 11:00 AM EST. No telephonic requests will be honored.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), on behalf of the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), has a requirement for advanced packaging in the arena of glass pre-filled syringes. Present day glass pre-filled syringes are not adequate to support the stability of next-generation protein vaccines for stockpiling. They currently contain a silicone oil lubricant that greatly increases protein absorption and aggregation which leads to product instability and decreased shelf-life. The contractor will create a uniform hybrid coating comprised of an optimized combination of their existing technologies. This hybrid coating will act as a protein deterrent as well as a lubricant reducing protein absorption and aggregation. The contractor will also develop analytical tools to evaluate and improve the uniformity of the coatings applied to the inside of glass pre-filled syringes. USAMRAA intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Schott North America, Inc. The intent is to make a sole source award pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(1)  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), supplies are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Schott North America possesses significant experience in glass pharmaceutical packaging. They have research expertise in the fundamental understanding of bio-molecule/surface interactions, silicone-free lubrication, and protein deterrent coatings. They are the technology leader in coated pharmaceutical packaging for drug stabilization and have extensive analytical tools at their disposal for inspection and quality assurance. They have been granted numerous patents pertinent to this research and are the only manufacturer that has overcome the major technological hurdles required to proceed into an advanced development effort for glass pre-filled syringes. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document exists. Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer by way of the Contract Specialist within fifteen calendar days from the date of publication of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide the stated capability within the established timeframe. Information can be sent to the Contract Specialist, Kathryn McCune at kathryn.mccune@us.army.mil. No telephone requests will be accepted. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.

Skydive Arizona is the only known HUBZone small business concern with the capability of providing this service.  Skydive Arizonas facility and location possesses the highly specific requirements in regards to aircraft, vertical wind tunnel, instructors, air space, parachute certification, climate conducive to year-round training, and lodging.  Skydive Arizona is considered the only HUBZone small business source capable of meeting the current requirements for year round training, who has the free fall training facilities already in place, and who is currently meets stringent requirements to conduct air operations.  Skydive Arizonas location will allow USASOC to meet its real world requirements to train Military Free Fall (MFF) operations year round without loss of training days due to bad weather.  The rural setting, terrain, and environment in Arizona will provide a realistic training environment and is ideal for conducting HALO/HAHO jumps.  Skydive Arizona currently has a large fleet of privately owned aircraft, giving them the ability to support operations on site and a vertical wind tunnel capable of safely supporting advanced team training operations.  The period of performance is for a base year of 1 February 2009  31 January 2010 with two (2) one-year options.  The applicable NAICS code is 481219.  The anticipated date of award is NLT 1 December  2008.  This notice is not a request for offers.  FAR 19.1306 provides agencies the authority to negotiate exclusively with a HUBZone small business concern when there is only one known HUBZone small business with the capabilities the Government requires.  However, any other responsible HUBZone small business concern believing itself fully capable of meeting the requirements may submit written technical documentation to establish the potential of meeting the Government's requirements.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon written responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  To be considered, any such written responses must be received by this office by 17 November 2008 at 10:00 a.m. EST.  No extensions will be granted.  Telephone responses will not be accepted.

Please see the attached Word Doc for a complete description.  All quotes should meet the requirements of the attached Item Purchase Description.  Please note that an SPQ is not a formal contract. While we call it a one-year SPQ it is not in any way binding for the vendor or the government.  If the vendor has a price increase during the one-year period, the vendor will need to contact the government and the appropriate action will be taken.  In this case, the higher price will either be authorized or the government will cancel the SPQ and re-advertise it on FedBizOpps.  Also if the vendor can no longer provide the item for any reason, the vendor will need to contact the government and the orders will be stopped.  For questions please contact Clarissa McDaniel, Contract Specialist, at 816-823-1290.  Please e-mail (preferred) or fax your quotes to Clarissa McDaniel at 816-823-3109 by November 7, 2008.

Statement of Work  USCG Aviation Training Requirements

1.  Scope of Work:  This Statement of Work describes the vessel and personnel required to support U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen, PR.  The contractor will be responsible for providing and operating a vessel in support of the U.S. Coast Guard's aviation training program.  Specifically, the contractor shall provide all necessary management, supervision, personnel, labor, materials, fuel, and equipment necessary for the vessel to support helicopter hoisting operations.

2.  Background:  One of the Coast Guard's primary missions is Search and Rescue.  In order for the Air Station to fulfill this mission, it is necessary to conduct helicopter hoists of equipment and rescue swimmers to/from underway vessels and to/from the water.  These skill sets require both initial and proficiency training for Coast Guard pilots and aircrews.  This training requires small boat support.  The U.S. Coast Guard's increased OPTEMPO and Homeland Security mission has reduced the availability of Coast Guard small boats and crews to provide support for required aviation training.

3.  Vessel Description:  The vessel shall be no smaller than 34 feet and no longer than 65 feet in length and shall have at least a 10 foot beam. The maximum draft of the vessel shall not exceed 4 feet. Gross vessel weight shall be a minimum of 8 tons.

       a.  Other Characteristics:  The vessel must be capable of easily recovering personnel from the water.  The minimum required speed for the vessel is 0 knots or "dead in the water".  The vessel must have the endurance to maintain 10 knots transit speed for a minimum of 3 hours; 15 knots for 3 hours desired.  The vessel must be capable of maintaining a heading of +/-10 degrees at 5 knots while operating under a large helicopter producing 90 knots of rotor downwash in varying sea states and winds.  An extremely shallow draft vessel is undesirable due to drift characteristics when subjected to rotor downwash.  The vessel must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 20 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed (e.g., antennas).

      b.  Required Deck Area:  The minimum deck area is 58 sq ft on the aft (fantail) portion of the vessel to allow two crew members to safely conduct operations.  The deck area must be free of all obstructions.

      c.Vessel Equipment:  The vessel shall have, at a minimum, all equipment required by law including a fathometer, VHF-FM multiple frequency capable 2 way marine radio with specified frequencies/channels (13, 16, 21, 22, 23, 81, 83) and minimum ranges (20NM), a cell phone for secondary communications to the Air Station Borinquen Operations Center, GPS, and a long distance high beam search light. 

      d.Safety Equipment:  The vessel shall be outfitted with a contractor furnished first aid kit and approved Type III personal flotation devices for crew and passengers.  The contractor shall provide helmets, goggles, and grounding rods for use by crew members during helicopter hoisting operations.

      e.Required Docking/Mooring Facilities:  The contractor will be responsible for providing docking/mooring facilities for their vessel.  The vessel shall be located within a 45 minute transit time from the geographical areas of operation.

      f.Vessel Maintenance:  The contractor shall operate and maintain the vessel, all equipment and systems in accordance with the original equipment manufacturer's technical manuals and specifications, United States Coast Guard regulations, and any applicable federal, state, and/or local regulations. 
 

4. Personnel:  All contractor personnel are required to be U. S. citizens or legal residents of the United States.

      a.  Point of Contact:  The contractor shall provide a point of contact who shall be available to discuss work performed under this contract during the normal working day and periods of underway time.  The point of contact shall be able to read, write, and speak English fluently.

      b.  Crew:  Minimum vessel crew shall consist of a coxswain and two deckhands.  The crew shall be currently trained in rescue techniques and water survival.  Each of the crew members shall be capable of operating and maneuvering the vessel during helicopter hoist operations and any required rescue operations.

      c.  Coxswain:  The coxswain shall be licensed, at a minimum, for the size of the vessel being operated, including the carriage of six passengers, and shall be qualified in CPR.

      d.  Deckhands:  The deckhands shall be knowledgeable in shipboard operations, rigging for helicopter operations, and deck seamanship.

5.  Operational Requirements / Sites:  The schedule required and the operating site is as follows:

      a.  Normal Schedule:  Typically the contractor will be required to provide services one day per week (usually on Monday).  Operations will typically be conducted for on scene periods of 3 hours commencing 1-2 hours prior to official sunset.  The Coast Guard will provide specific times for services a minimum of 24 hours in advance.  Additional training periods may be conducted more than once a week to accommodate surge training requirements on a schedule mutually agreed upon by the parties.

      b.  Area of Operations:  The area of operations will be from Latitude 18-15.00N to 18-30.00N from the shoreline out to longitude 067-25.00W.  

      c.  Operational Log:  The contractor shall maintain a log of all operations, which includes dates, location, times, duration and type of evolutions being performed.  The log shall be passed to Air Station Borinquen COTR on a monthly basis within 5 days of the end of the month.

      d.  Communications during Operations:  The contractor shall ensure that the vessel contacts Air Station Borinquens operations watch stander at intervals not to exceed 30 minutes while engaged in aviation training services.

      e.  Weather Criteria:  The Vessel must be capable of completing training requirements in sea states of up to 6 feet and wind speeds of up to 30 knots.

      f.  Functions / Tasks:  The contractor shall support training operations for the hoisting and/or delivery of equipment from government aircraft.  These objects may be delivered directly to the contract vessel or dropped into the water for retrieval.  The contractor shall also serve as an on scene search and rescue and rescue asset during helicopter rescue swimmer deployment evolutions and helicopter approaches to the water.  The training to be conducted will be both initial for new aviators/aircrews and proficiency maintenance for experienced aviators/aircrews.

6. Performance Evaluation Meetings:  The contractor's project manager shall meet at least monthly with the Contracting Officer or COTR during the first two months of the contract to discuss performance problems and review contractor corrective actions.  The operational log will also be used to verify the contractor's timely arrival on station.  If the contractor fails to meet the scheduled training events or is unable to complete the training activity, the frequency of not fulfilling the scheduled requirements may be the basis for a monetary deduction in the charter hire.  Meetings will be held thereafter at intervals to be established by the COTR.

7.  Communication Procedures:  The government shall provide/assign VHF communication frequencies for contractor use.  The contractor shall provide a cell phone on board for secondary communications with the Air Station Borinquen Operations Center. 

8.  Orientation Briefing & Training:  The government shall provide an orientation brief and initial training for key contract personnel prior to the contract start date.  The orientation and training will include at a minimum safe boating practices, vessel hoisting operations, rescue swimmer operations, dewatering pump delivery operations, etc.  The government shall also provide semi-annual refresher training on the same items.

9.  Invoicing for Service:  A set payment will be established for a standard training block.  The payment will be the same regardless of whether the Coast Guard actually uses the full scheduled time.  The standard training block will include three hours of contract vessel on scene time, not including transit time to/from the training site from the contractor's mooring/docking location.  Scheduled unused training time may be banked by the Air Station and added onto any future training block.  No training block shall exceed six hours.  Unused training time may not be used to set up a separate trip.  Any unused training time at the end of the contract will be forfeited and the Government will retain any unused funds. (Reference FAR 12.403 (d), Termination for the Governments Convenience.) 

10.  Insurance:  Contractor is responsible for ensuring they have adequate liability insurance coverage under FAR 28.306(a-2).

STATEMENT OF WORK -- CONTRACT ROLE PLAYER SERVICES -- ADVANCED ADMISSIBILITY SECONDARY PROCESSING (AASP) -- ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TRAINING PROGRAM (EOTP) 
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, (CBP) Advanced Training Center, (ATC) Harpers Ferry, West Virginia requires contract role-player services in support of training delivery for course offerings conducted at the Center for a Base year period of December 1, 2008 through November 30, 2009, plus four (4) one year renewal options through November 30, 2013. 
A. SCOPE
1. Role-player services will be provided on a reoccurring basis to multiple classes on a prearranged schedule as supplied by CBP to the contractor. At a minimum role players will be used to support the Advanced Admissibility Secondary Processing (AASP) Course and the Enforcement Officer Training Program (EOTP) conducted during the specified contract period.
2. The AASP course requires up to twelve (12) role-players x eight (8) hours per class. It is estimated that approximately 22 classes will be conducted in a FY = *2,112 est. hours (12 x 8 x 22= 2112). Schedules will be provided to the contractor at least one quarter in advance. The number of hours is subject to change due to National security reprioritizing of CBP mission requirements and may entail discontinuation or reduction in training which may change the number of classes without notice. In the event it is necessary to reprioritize and reduce the number f role players required or cancel a scheduled class, for other than weather or immediate national emergency response, the CBP Contracting Officer Technical Representative shall provide a 48 hour written cancellation notice to the contractor. However, if the cancellation is weather or national emergency response related, a 48 hour notification cannot be guaranteed. 
3. The EOTP course requires up to two (2) role-players x sixteen (16) hours per class. This is estimated at four, 4-hour blocks. It is estimated that there will be up to nine classes in a FY=288 hours. Schedules will be provided to the contractor at least one quarter in advance. In the event it is necessary to reprioritize and reduce the number of role players required or cancel a scheduled class, for other than weather or immediate national emergency response, the CBP Contracting Officer Technical Representative shall provide a 48 hour written cancellation notice to the contractor. However, if the cancellation is weather or national emergency response related, a 48 hour notification cannot be guaranteed. 
Classes for AASP and EOTP are conducted Monday through Friday between the ATC core hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. The specific days and eight or four hour blocks of time the role-players will be needed are dependent upon the overall class schedule start and finish dates. Schedules will be provided one quarter in advance to the contractor, identifying times and dates role-playing services are required. 
B. ROLE PLAYER DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The role-players for the academic AASP and EOTP classes will perform a variety of roles related to Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as material witnesses and defendants and as individuals making application for entry to the United States.
For AASP and EOTP role-playing, the scripted roles and information made available to role-players during the conduct of the practical exercise is not considered law enforcement sensitive and is consistent with that information made available to the traveling public. 
In the event a role-player is needed for a scenario that is law-enforcement sensitive, prior coordination will be made with the contractor for role-players with previous law-enforcement experience. Physical contact for other than academic role-playing will be no more than handcuffing and physical search. 
Role-players must be U.S. citizens, 18 years of age or older.
Contractor personnel who will report to the ATC and serve as Role-players are required to have completed ***NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK (NAC) ensuring their suitability for the duties required and access to the Advanced Training Center, a secure facility. The ***NAC allows the assigned personnel to have unescorted access to the ATC.
6. Prior role-player experience is not required 
Any scripts or external props and resources necessary to conduct the practical exercise will be provided by the ATC.
An appropriate dress code for the role-players will be coordinated between CBP and the contractor. CBP reserves the right to reject a role-player for inappropriate dress, actions or other articulable reasons.
A lead role-player will be assigned to ensure an adequate number of role-players are present. Lead role players will ensure a sign-in and sign-out sheet is utilized and that all role-players remain at the designated practical exercise area until the responsible officer has signed the roster and been afforded the opportunity to provide comments, if any, in the space provided.
A roster of the role-players reporting for each practical exercise shall be provided to the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) for verification and certification of invoices submitted for processing.
11. Abide by Customs and Border Protection, Advanced Training Center guidelines for classroom management, integrity and fraternization.
12. All vendor employees having access to the content of the training, will be asked to sign the Confidentiality Agreement provided by the vendor.
C. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
1. The Contractor must conduct Employment Eligibility Verification by requiring applicants to show their U.S. Passport OR a combination of a valid state drivers license AND an original social security card or birth certification (with seal).
Each role-player assigned to work on and within the scope of this purchase order will be required to satisfactorily complete and pass a ***NAC with the Office of Personnel Management proof of completed background must be supplied to CBP for verification. CBP reserves the right to conduct their own backgrounds checks (no persons with a felony or misdemeanors in the last 8 years will be allowed access).
Contract employees are required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination. Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials.

1. What is the GS equivalent of the positions (Role Players)?
Answer:  FAR 52.222-42  Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires. ***$13.60 per hour, GS-4.

Answer:  Khan & Hill.  The current Purchase Order (PO) was awarded originally for only 6 months (NO Base and Option years) and did not require the Service Contract Act Wage Determination (as this new RFQ does).  Pricing $26.20 per hour.
3.  The SOW, item 2 indicates the AASP course requires 12 role players x 8 hours per class and it is estimated that 22 classes will be conducted in a FY = 1728 hours.  My calculation shows 12 x 8 x 22= 2112 hours.  The EOTP course requirement per fiscal year is 288 hours.  Therefore, if 2112 is the correct calculation for AASP, the total hours should be 2400 hours instead of 2016 hours. Please confirm the correct number of hours for the RFQ.

15.  If so, what is the applicable wage determination?
Answer:  See Wage Determination number at bottom of RFQ - *** 01261-Personnel Assistant I 
16.  If so, and there is a vendor currently providing this hourly labor service, has the hourly labor rate been indexed against the prevailing wage determination and what is that indexed rate?
Answer:  The current PO did not require SCA.  The future (Option years) employee rate is determined by any revised Wage Determinations needing to be incorporated at the time an Option is exercised. 
17.  We suggest that a Manager be included and that some training time is available to assist in performance?  
Answer:  No, the contractor will designate one of their employees to be the lead and also act as a role player.  
18.  The rates for roleplayers are not currently in the AWD and will have to be conformed. We will suggest a fair rate that includes H&W.
Answer:  See *** 01261-Personnel Assistant I for appropriate rate to be used.  Your company has to determine the Option year pricing (note: if a new wage determination is put into effect, the Wage Determination will be incorporated into the Option Year modification (if the Option year is exercised) IAW Far regulation.
19. FBO version cuts off at the bottom of page 2.  Can you send the rest of the package?
Answer:  Copy then Paste the RFQ if your computer does not fully print out.
Amend #4 Questions and Answers:
*** 20.  Have a question re: NACI.  This has been handled thru DHS in our other contracts. Do you have the forms on site? and are any of the current employees already cleared? And, I need to know the procedures and cost associated with the national agency checks? 
Answer:  The NACI is deleted.  A NAC check is required.  The approximate cost for the NAC Check is $88.75.  After award the contractor shall process the required paperwork for a NAC with the COTR(and respective office).  The cost will either be deducted from a monthly invoice or a check payment will be required.  A contractor is not required to conduct a NAC check before award, but is responsible if work/service is stopped due to an employee(s) not passing the NAC Check and no other employees are available to perform.  No information is provided current status of employees background check status.
***Note1:  The Equivalent Rate For Hire of $13.60 is not the required Wage Determination Amount.  A contractor must include the Wage Determination Amount and any other payment requirements (e.g. Health and Welfare) of the SCA Wage Determination.***

<DESC>AETC has a need to convert approximately 3300 hours (28+ courses) of classroom based courseware to Distance Learning in less than two years.  The objective of this program is to be able to reduce TDY to school costs while providing the training to our Airmen anytime, anywhere.  This supports the AFSO 21 program and is in line with both AFSO 21 and AETC goals.

Converting the required courses to Computer Based Training (CBT) is considered commercial in nature since it is the same service that is provided to the general public.  The final delivered product must be 100% operable with the AETC Advanced Distribution Learning System (ADLS).

The anticipated Solicitation release date is on or about 17 November 2008.  The solicitation will be a competitive 8(a) set-aside that will result in up to four indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract awards.

All anticipated task orders for converting classes will be placed by 30 September 2009, with final deliveries and acceptance of converted classes occurring NLT 30 September 2010.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A-10 European and Pacific In-theater Depots<br />Industry Day and Risk Assessment Workshop</span></strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p><br />The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) will be hosting an Industry Day to discuss the United States Air Force requirement for in-theater contract depot repair support for A-10 aircraft based overseas at Spangdahlem AB, Germany (USAFE) and Osan AB, Republic of South Korea (PACAF). The A-10 SPO is interested in meeting with industry representatives to answer questions and receive feedback regarding this requirement to assist with acquisition planning and program strategy. As part of this Industry Day, a Risk Assessment Workshop will be conducted with industry attendees to aid the A-10 SPO with identification of potential risks areas and mitigation options to be considered.</p>
<p><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><br />There are two separate requirements contracts associated with this Industry Day. For each region of operation, Europe and the Republic of South Korea, the U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Historical aircraft induction numbers and future projections for the proposed contract period are included in the slides attached to this posting. Please note that although Precision Engagement modifications are included as a projected requirement for PACAF, the USAF has not yet determined whether these modifications will be completed by the in-theater depot facility or performed by way of aircraft swaps with previously modified aircraft. In addition, please refer to the briefing slides attached to this posting for descriptions of the SLEP and SSI programs.</p>
<p><br />In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (approximately 400 Nautical Miles) of the respective A-10 operating location (Spangdahlem or Osan AB).</p>
<p><br /><strong>INDUSTRY DAY</strong></p>
<p><br />1. At this time the government does not intend to limit the number of representatives attending from each contractor's firm. However, depending on responses from industry, the government may be forced to impose limits due to room capacity.</p>
<p>2. In order to attend Industry Day, each contractor must provide the following for each attendee:</p>
<p>a. Name, address and CAGE code of firm<br />b. Indicate status of company - Small Business or Large Business<br />c. Full Name of individual, citizenship status and contact information</p>
<p>This information must be received by the Industry Day POC via email not later than <strong>17 November 2008</strong>.</p>
<p><br />In addition, all foreign national attendees must submit a Foreign Visit Request through their respective embassy. Please contact the Industry Day POC with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p><br />3. If any individual contractor wishes to have one on one sessions with government personnel, requests should be made by 17 Nov 08. Individual time allocations will be made by the government and provided to contractors prior to Industry Days.</p>
<p>4. An optional tour of the Ogden Air Logistics Center A-10 Depot Repair Line is being considered. Please indicate your interest in attending a tour and the number of attendees by 17 Nov 08.</p>
<p>5. A Base Access Letter will be coordinated in advance once your RSVP and Foreign Visit Request (if applicable) have been received. If you require any assistance obtaining base access or directions to the conference room location (Building 1234, Main Conference Room), please advise the Industry Day POC.</p>
<p>6. Tentative agenda for this event:</p>
<p>19 Nov 08<br />0730-0800 Attendees proceed to Building 1234, Main Conference Room<br />0800-0930 Government Briefing to Industry-Includes Q&amp;A<br />1000-1130 Risk Assessment Workshop (Location TBD)<br />1300-1600 Risk Assessment Workshop (continued)</p>
<p>20 Nov 08<br />0800-0900 OO-ALC A-10 Depot Facility Tour (Optional - pending attendee interest)<br />1030-1700 One-on-one sessions between individual contractors and government (Bldg 1233, South Conference Room)</p>
<p>&emsp;<br /><strong>RISK ASSESSMENT WORKSHOP</strong></p>
<p><br />A Risk Assessment Workshop (RAW) will be conducted to allow industry representatives to participate in risk identification and handling/mitigation options for the in-theater depot repair requirement. This workshop will aid the A-10 SPO with the development of a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy to ensure the success of achieving USAF objectives and requirements for in-theater contract repair of A-10 aircraft. <br />The RAW will be conducted by utilizing a computer-based Risk Management Information System. This system permits participants to brainstorm and anonymously submit potential program risk areas to be considered by the risk assessment team. Additional details and instructions regarding the use of this system will be provided during Industry Day. Due to space constraints, each contractor will be limited to two attendees for the RAW and assigned to a single computer terminal.</p>
<p><br />The A-10 SPO's past history with depot repair for the A-10 has shown that it is very difficult to accurately forecast depot repair requirements due to many unknown and unforeseen requirements that arise. This occurs in part because the A-10 is an aging aircraft that is experiencing problems with structural fatigue cracking. Historically, depot repair requirements have consistently exceeded projections resulting in increased work effort and funding added to the in-theater repair contracts. The A-10 SPO is interested in receiving input from industry regarding methods of managing the resulting program risks created by the inherent uncertainty of the requirements.</p>
<p><br />Contractor participants are asked to come prepared to indentify specific cost, schedule, performance, and technical risk areas associated with the in-theater depot repair requirement for A-10 aircraft. An internal risk assessment conducted by the A-10 SPO has identified the following top risk statements:</p>
<p><br />1. If significant unforeseen aircraft problems arise (i.e. additional structural cracking), then schedule and performance will be impacted.</p>
<p><br />2. If structural inspections drive excessive over-and-above repairs, then the contract ceiling may be exceeded.</p>
<p><br />3. If new inspection requirements are added in the future, pricing agreements must be renegotiated.</p>
<p><br />4. If available funding is decreased, then aircraft inductions must be reduced.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A-10 European and Pacific In-theater Depots<br />Industry Day and Risk Assessment Workshop</span></strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>SCOPE</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><br />The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) will be hosting an Industry Day to discuss the United States Air Force requirement for in-theater contract depot repair support for A-10 aircraft based overseas at Spangdahlem AB, Germany (USAFE) and Osan AB, Republic of South Korea (PACAF). The A-10 SPO is interested in meeting with industry representatives to answer questions and receive feedback regarding this requirement to assist with acquisition planning and program strategy. As part of this Industry Day, a Risk Assessment Workshop will be conducted with industry attendees to aid the A-10 SPO with identification of potential risks areas and mitigation options to be considered.</p>
<p><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p><br />There are two separate requirements contracts associated with this Industry Day. For each region of operation, Europe and the Republic of South Korea, the U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Historical aircraft induction numbers and future projections for the proposed contract period are included in the slides attached to this posting. Please note that although Precision Engagement modifications are included as a projected requirement for PACAF, the USAF has not yet determined whether these modifications will be completed by the in-theater depot facility or performed by way of aircraft swaps with previously modified aircraft. In addition, please refer to the briefing slides attached to this posting for descriptions of the SLEP and SSI programs. <br /><br />In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (approximately 400 Nautical Miles) of the respective A-10 operating location (Spangdahlem or Osan AB).</p>
<p><br /><strong>INDUSTRY DAY</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />1. At this time the government does not intend to limit the number of representatives attending from each contractor's firm. However, depending on responses from industry, the government may be forced to impose limits due to room capacity.</p>
<p>2. In order to attend Industry Day, each contractor must provide the following for each attendee:</p>
<p>a. Name, address and CAGE code of firm<br />b. Indicate status of company - Small Business or Large Business<br />c. Full Name of individual, citizenship status and contact information</p>
<p>This information must be received by the Industry Day POC via email not later than <strong>17 November 2008.</strong></p>
<p>
<p><strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
In addition, all foreign national attendees must submit a Foreign Visit Request through their respective embassy. Please contact the Industry Day POC with any questions or concerns. </strong></p>
</p>
<p><br />3. If any individual contractor wishes to have one on one sessions with government personnel, requests should be made by 17 Nov 08. Individual time allocations will be made by the government and provided to contractors prior to Industry Days.</p>
<p>4. An optional tour of the Ogden Air Logistics Center A-10 Depot Repair Line is being considered. Please indicate your interest in attending a tour and the number of attendees by 17 Nov 08.</p>
<p>5. A Base Access Letter will be coordinated in advance once your RSVP and Foreign Visit Request (if applicable) have been received. If you require any assistance obtaining base access or directions to the conference room location (Building 1234, Main Conference Room), please advise the Industry Day POC.</p>
<p>6. Tentative agenda for this event:</p>
<p>19 Nov 08<br />0730-0800 Attendees proceed to Building 1234, Main Conference Room<br />0800-0930 Government Briefing to Industry-Includes Q&amp;A<br />1000-1130 Risk Assessment Workshop (Location TBD)<br />1300-1600 Risk Assessment Workshop (continued)</p>
<p>20 Nov 08<br />0800-0900 OO-ALC A-10 Depot Facility Tour (Optional - pending attendee interest)<br />1030-1700 One-on-one sessions between individual contractors and government (Bldg 1233, South Conference Room)</p>
<p>&emsp;<br /><strong>RISK ASSESSMENT WORKSHOP</strong></p>
<p><br />A Risk Assessment Workshop (RAW) will be conducted to allow industry representatives to participate in risk identification and handling/mitigation options for the in-theater depot repair requirement. This workshop will aid the A-10 SPO with the development of a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy to ensure the success of achieving USAF objectives and requirements for in-theater contract repair of A-10 aircraft.</p>
<p><br />The RAW will be conducted by utilizing a computer-based Risk Management Information System. This system permits participants to brainstorm and anonymously submit potential program risk areas to be considered by the risk assessment team. Additional details and instructions regarding the use of this system will be provided during Industry Day. Due to space constraints, each contractor will be limited to two attendees for the RAW and assigned to a single computer terminal.</p>
<p><br />The A-10 SPO's past history with depot repair for the A-10 has shown that it is very difficult to accurately forecast depot repair requirements due to many unknown and unforeseen requirements that arise. This occurs in part because the A-10 is an aging aircraft that is experiencing problems with structural fatigue cracking. Historically, depot repair requirements have consistently exceeded projections resulting in increased work effort and funding added to the in-theater repair contracts. The A-10 SPO is interested in receiving input from industry regarding methods of managing the resulting program risks created by the inherent uncertainty of the requirements.</p>
<p><br />Contractor participants are asked to come prepared to indentify specific cost, schedule, performance, and technical risk areas associated with the in-theater depot repair requirement for A-10 aircraft. An internal risk assessment conducted by the A-10 SPO has identified the following top risk statements:</p>
<p><br />1. If significant unforeseen aircraft problems arise (i.e. additional structural cracking), then schedule and performance will be impacted.</p>
<p><br />2. If structural inspections drive excessive over-and-above repairs, then the contract ceiling may be exceeded.</p>
<p><br />3. If new inspection requirements are added in the future, pricing agreements must be renegotiated.</p>
<p><br />4. If available funding is decreased, then aircraft inductions must be reduced.</p>
<p><br />5. If aircraft structural inspection criteria are not clearly defined by the technical data, then defects in the aircraft may go unnoticed.</p>
<p><br />6. If new aircraft modification programs become a requirement in the future, then contract must be renegotiated/re-competed to add additional workload.</p>
<p><br />7. If contractor cannot obtain parts support from suppliers, then production delays will result.</p>
<p><br />8. If a new contractor is&nbsp;selected, then Government Furnished Equipment must be transferred to the new contractor.</p>
<p><br />9. If contractor's proposed flow-time is exceeded, then aircraft induction schedule must be modified to meet aircraft availability requirements.</p>
<p><br />10. If aircraft flying rates (ops tempo) changes, then aircraft induction requirements may increase or decrease.</p>
<p><br />11. If contractor cannot obtain PKI certification to access U.S. Government information systems such as Technical Order databases, then contract performance will be impacted.</p>
<p><br />12. If contractor facility's host nation has strict customs restrictions, then additional import/export fees may be incurred.</p>

<DESC><p>When responding, please submit a copy of your response directly to Christine Parker. Christine's e-mail is christine.parker@hill.af.mil; her fax number and address are the same as what is identified for James G. Thiros in the original synopsis. Please provide Christine the same e-mail notification that the synopsis requests that you provide to James G. Thiros. Even though you submit a copy of your response to Christine, you must still submit your response to James G. Thiros.</p>
<p>The original synopsis states that a second source selection competition (that would result in a best value award to only one contractor as part of the 2nd phase) would include a requirement for delivery of one prototype using a cost-plus type pricing arrangement. Given that this same award would also include a requirement for delivery of production units at firm-fixed-prices, it is currently anticipated that the prototype requirement would use a firm-fixed-price pricing arrangement (instead of the cost-plus type). As part of your company's response, please indicate if the company does not believe that a firm-fixed price pricing arrangement is reasonable for the prototype; if the response is that a firm-fixed-price would not be reasonable for the prototype, please provide rationale. As a minimum, the rationale must identify why firm-fixed-prices are not reasonable for the prototype even though (1) both the prototype and production units will be proposed after a "development" point at which the Government anticipates (based on market research) contractors can propose firm-fixed-price production units; and (2) production units will depend on the prototype completion.</p>
<p><br />When your company provides a response to the requests that are identified in the "Request each interested contractor:" section of the original sources-sought-synopsis, as well as to the additional request identified in the paragraph above, it would be appreciated if each specific request was answered in a separate section and if each section began with a restatement of the specific Government request.</p>

THE PROCESS IS THE SAME AS ORIGANLLY STATED IN THE MARCH 27, 2008 ANNOUNCEMENT. A TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT IS PROVIDED, MS ERICA BECVAR, AFCEE/TDV, 210-536-4314, e-mail </strong><a href="mailto:erica.becvar@brooks.af.mil"><strong>erica.becvar@brooks.af.mil</strong></a><strong> .</strong></p>
<p>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Restoration Branch, Technology Transfer Office (TDV) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement is open for one year and will be advertised annually. This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies to reduce environmental impacts from current and past Air Force (AF) operations and apply to Air Force installations worldwide. The key focus of this effort is to further develop demonstration/field-tested remediation, contaminated site characterization and monitoring, and pollution prevention technologies and methodologies that serve as an innovative means to save money and time while achieving compliance with all air, soil, and water regulatory requirements and Air Force policies and technical guidance. The goal is to identify more technically advanced, efficient, effective, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective solutions than are currently available. Such technologies and methodologies should aid the US Air Force in reaching the remedy-in-place (RIP) goal of 2012 or optimizing current remediation or monitoring systems already in place. The purpose of this acquisition is to apply promising demonstration/field-tested innovative technologies and methodologies. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase. The remedial technologies areas of interest include, but are not limited to, effective dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) characterization, monitoring, fate and transport, detection, and remediation; improve/optimize remediation and long-term monitoring (LTM) technologies; assessment and mitigation of hazards associated with vapor intrusion; remedial techniques and methods to more effectively treat soil and groundwater contaminated with chlorinated solvents; implementation of rapid site characterization through definitive field-based analytical methods for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi VOCs, and other common contaminants. Additional areas of interest include innovative pollution prevention techniques, innovative site characterization approaches and tools, new and innovative quality assurance methodologies, and innovative monitoring and optimization systems for existing remediation operations (e.g., pump-and-treat) including sensors and data management systems. Proposal submittal is a two-phase process. Phase I Offerors submit proposals by completing a short questionnaire on the AFCEE BAA web page developed specifically to facilitate proposal submittal in the BAA program. The requested information includes: description of the technology (synonymous with methodology, as applicable) being proposed and a discussion of the technical benefits to include the type of site and specific problem addressed; contamination and media treated; description of how project supports the Remedy-in-Place (RIP)/Response Complete (RC) Goal of 2012; qualifications of the offeror; estimated cost range of the demonstration/field testing of the technology; and approximated time to complete the proposed effort. Limits to the length of each section are noted in the web-based proposal form. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 8 December 2008. Phase I submittals received after&nbsp;8&nbsp;December 2008, may or may not be evaluated. However, these proposals will be held for possible action until expiration of this BAA. The Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) using the same selection criteria used to evaluate Phase II proposals. It is critical that the offeror convey the above information accurately and concisely so that proposal evaluators can judge the merits of the proposed demonstration/field testing of the technology. Those proposals that are judged innovative and meet program requirements are selected for further evaluation in Phase II. Offerors whose proposals are not selected for Phase II are notified electronically of this decision, while those selected are similarly notified and invited to submit a Phase II proposal as an attachment to the electronic format provided via Internet link. To be eligible for award submission of Phase I is required. Phase II proposals are to include expanded descriptions/discussion of the following information: Technology or methodology proposed including results of previous development/demonstration/field testing, pilot-scale or treatability studies. The technology or methodology must be described in sufficient detail to enable reviewers to understand the nature and probability of successful application. The proposal shall include the types of contaminants treated, the media (i.e., soil, groundwater) treated, and any limitations known to affect the application of the technology or methodology. Benefits to the USAF of using the proposed technology or methodology. This should include a comparison with existing technologies or methodologies used to treat the same contaminants, and how the proposed technology or methodology improves cleanup over existing technology or methodology and/or lowers the cost of environmental restoration/prevention. The objectives of the proposed technology or methodology demonstration/field testing, the tasks to be accomplished during the demonstration/field testing, the project schedule, and the location or type of site recommended for the demonstration/field test. The qualifications of the offeror to successfully perform the technology or methodology demonstration/field test. Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are provided a link in the electronic notification by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted. Phase II proposals shall be submitted as attachments to an electronic submittal form that is accessed via the notification from AFCEE. The technical proposal shall be limited to 10 pages, typed at 10 pitch or larger type, single spaced, and single sided, on sheets 8.5 X 11 with 1 margins. This page limitation is inclusive of indexes, photographs, fold-outs, appendices, and attachments. Pages in excess of this limitation will not be evaluated by Government evaluators. Suggested inclusion within the 10 page limitation are: (1) four pages describing the proposed technology or methodology, (2) one page containing a SOW, (3) one page discussing the capability of the offeror, references and point of contact for the demonstration/field test, (4) three pages describing proposed schedule for demonstration/field test, past experience and performance, and other places the technology or methodology has been demonstrated, and (5) one page list of key personnel that will perform the demonstration/field test. The cost proposal has no page limitations; however, offerors are requested to use five (5) pages as a goal. The cost and technical proposals are to be submitted together in Microsoft Word and Excel formats. Submittals to this BAA Phase I shall be through the following Internet address http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/baa . Each electronic form shall address only one technology and one topic. Separate forms shall be submitted for each additional topic or additional technology. Response time for Phase II submittal will be 30 days from electronic notice. The submittal shall concisely describe the technology and shall be evaluated according to the criteria stated in this announcement. No additional data may be submitted for this BAA. If additional data is submitted, it will be discarded. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merits and will not be evaluated against each other. The TEB will evaluate the submittals to this BAA. Vendor submittals that meet all of the evaluation criteria will be accepted into the BAA program. Once accepted into the program, the proposal will be shared with appropriate DOD personnel for consideration. Vendor submittals having a technology or process applicable to a specific environmental need may be asked to contract for a field application. Final selection for award will be based on an evaluation of an offeror's Phase II full proposal (both technical and cost) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. (1) The technical aspect, which is ranked as first in importance, shall be evaluated based on the following criteria which are of equal importance. New solutions with unique applications to Air Force problems. Organization, clarity and thoroughness of the proposed SOW. Technical approach and ability to perform.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued Request for Proposal number WC133M-08-RP-0103 for expendable dropwindsondes for the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill AFB, FL. The AOC instruments, maintains and operates aircraft in support of a variety of meteorological and oceanographic research projects. One of the primary requirements in a variety of missions involves measuring and recording the atmospheric conditions below the aircraft. The method used to obtain these atmospheric profiles utilizes an expendable dropwindsonde which is launched from the aircraft and then transmits meteorological data back to a radio receiver and processing system onboard the aircraft. The system used by the AOC and other U.S. Government agencies is called the Airborne Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (AVAPS). The Government intends to award a fixed-price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for a base period of twenty-four months, and three twelve-month option periods. The estimated quantity per year is 3000 each, however, there is no guarantee that this quantity will be required or ordered. The dropwindsonde deliverables must meet the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) drawing set requirements which will be included in the solicitation. Alternate designs may be considered, however, any proposed design modifications shall include: an acceptance test procedure sufficient to verify the revised design is equivalent or improves upon the NCAR drawing set design; estimated cost to the Government to perform this design verification; and analysis of the benefit to the Government for selecting an alternate design. Best commercial practices shall be employed throughout the manufacturing process. All deliverables shall successfully pass NCAR drawing specifications prior to delivery.

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) in support of the United States Marshals Service (USMS)/Bureau of Prisons (BOP), is conducting a Sources Sought synopsis for information purposes only. This is not a solicitation announcement. Currently, no solicitation is available. This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation of any submission to this Sources Sought Notice.

The purpose of this request for information is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be publicized in FedBizOpps. All interested offerors will be required to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

OFDT awarded an Intergovernmental Agreement IGA #60-01-0027, between OFDT and the Mahoning County Sheriffs Department, 110 5th Avenue, Youngstown, Ohio 44503, for housing Federal detainees at the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center. OFDT is considering terminating the IGA and awarding a contract to a private vendor for a period of not less than 10 years, however, not more than 20 years. OFDT considers these services available only from the original source which is for the continued provision of highly specialized detention services and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The anticipated scope of services to be provided and their respective functional areas are detailed below: 

OFDT is in search of existing detention facility located within the geographic boundaries of Youngstown, Ohio with a capacity of not less than 600 beds to house persons in custody of USMS/BOP with federal offenses and detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, a hearing on their immigration status, or deportation. The requirement will include secure transportation services from the facility. 

Construction of a new facility is not a consideration for this request.

Other Interested parties having the required physical plant to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement to include the following: (1) Name and address of firm; (2) Size of business; (3) Average annual revenue for past three years; (4) Number of employees; (5) Ownership of firm; (6) Business size (large, small, disadvantage); (7) Number of years in business; (8) Affiliate information (parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor if potential sub, subcontractors if potential prime; and (9) List of customers cover past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, point of contact with address and phone number).

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for any information solicited. All responses shall be submitted to Robert Moffett no later than November 12, 2008.

The estimated base and option year contract capacities are $24.5M, $24M, $15M, $15M and $11.5M respectively. Contract options may be exercised early if the contract capacity is utilized before the contract performance period expires. However, the contract rates do not increase until the annual period for which they were negotiated has elapsed. If capacity remains available at the expiration of any contract performance period and the Government determines it to be in its best interest to exercise the next contract option period, the unused capacity will be rolled forward for use in the subsequent contract performance period. The annual rates for the then-current contract period will become effective for both the unused capacity of the previous period and the current annual capacity. The annual contract rates are fixed prices for the annual period for which they are negotiated and shall not be adjusted as a result of the early exercise of contract options or when unused capacity is rolled forward to subsequent option years.  The contract minimum guarantee of $10,000 may be obligated via issuance of an initial task order concurrent with award of the IDC.  The IDC is anticipated to be awarded in February of 2009.

As a minimum requirement, contractor personnel will be required to obtain Department of Energy badging.  On August 27, 2004, President Bush signed Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/08/20040827-8.html. Based upon this directive, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) developed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS Pub) 201 http://www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201-1/FIPS-201-1-chng1.pdf, including a description of the minimum requirements for a Federal personal identification verification (PIV). HSPD-12 directs the implementation of a new standardized badging process, which is designed to enhance security, reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy by establishing a mandatory, Government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government to its employees, contractors, and other classes of individuals. The Department of Energy (DOE) began implementing the HSPD-12 program on October 27, 2005.<BR>Only those individuals who meet the minimum requirements under the PIV process will be issued the DOE Common Badge or the follow-on HSPD-12 Standard Badge.<BR> AE firm must have sufficient resources (12 cost personnel) to work at multiple sites for long durations (often up to 30 days).
