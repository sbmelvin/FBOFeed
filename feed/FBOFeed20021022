<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the mechanical measurement, disassembly, transportation, and relocation of a NASA-owned Model 5751 Compact Range Reflector. The Compact Range Reflector will be relocated from the B-64 facility at Lockheed Martin, Marietta, GA to NASA Langley Research Center. The contractor shall perform a mechanical measurement of the reflector structure to define a benchmark before moving the reflector and perform the mechanical measurement again after the reflector is relocated to NASA Langley. The contractor shall be responsible for disassembly to include removal of the serrations and removal of the reflector from stands. The serrations shall be marked to define their position and location, removed from the reflector, and then wrapped in crates to protect them from damage during shipment and storage. The stands shall be removed from the mounting positions and secured for shipment. The reflector shall be placed on special dollies, provided by the contractor, to support the reflector during removal from the facility and while moving into storage at NASA Langley. The contractor shall provide adequate coverings and make sure it is secured properly on a double drop, air ride suspension trailer for transportation. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the required services from MI Technologies who is the only responsible source and no other services will satisfy the Agency requirements. MI Technologies is the original manufacturer of the reflector and also installed the reflector in the Lockeed Martin facility. As the original manufacturer, they have years of unique experience transporting and erecting reflectors of this type in facilities throughout the country, ensuring familiarity with the existing mounting and support system.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 24, 2002.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

In the blast/fragment area, the low altitude fuze sensor has evolved from a single nose-mounted unit that contained safe, arm, and fire components, a fuze sensor, and an explosive train with booster (FMU-113) to a distributed system with a nose-mounted fuze sensor (DSU-33), mid-body turbine generator (FZU-48) and a tail-mounted impact fuze (FMU-152).  Both of these designs require the fuze sensor to be nose-mounted and exclude using them with nose-mounted guidance kits.  By design, the penetrating warheads do not have a nose fuze well and do not allow the use of any existing fuze sensor to give them a height-of-burst (HOB) fuzing capability.  A tail-mounted fuze sensor that can be form factored to work with large (MK-83, MK-84, BLU-109, BLU-113, BLU-116) and small (MK-81, MK-82, Small Diameter Bomb, etc.) guided weapons, which may or may not have nose-mounted guidance kits, is needed.  This device must be capable of interfacing with tail-mounted fuzes (FMU-152, FMU-159, etc.) by providing a selectable HOB fire signal, near surface burst (NSB) fire signal, and real time closing velocity information (as appropriate).  In addition to the tail-mount fuze sensor, the AFRL Targets Under Trees Program (TUT) has expressed the need for a precision, nose-mounted, foliage penetration HOB fuze capability that enables INS/GPS guided weapons to realistically engage targets in heavy foliage.  (2) Program Objective:  The FAST Sensors Advanced Development Program intends to develop the next generation fuze sensor for use with blast/fragment, penetrating, low collateral damage, and agent defeat unitary warheads.  Three modes of operation are required for this device:  selectable HOB, near surface burst (NSB), and penetration based upon the true ground level at the point of identified interest (targeted location).  A selectable HOB is needed because lethality studies show a significant increase in probability of kill (Pk) when the correct HOB is used against surface targets.  A NSB mode is also needed to achieve maximum Pk for a zero HOB.  Lethality studies also show the fuze sensor must determine a zero HOB because impact fuzes bury the warhead greater than 25 percent prior to detonation and significantly degrade lethality. In the penetration mode, the fuze sensor will provide a real-time closing velocity, and a ground impact signal to the penetration fuze for accurate calculation of weapon depth of burial.  The next generation fuze sensor will be highly resistant to Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Countermeasures (EMI/ECM) and must correctly function for closing velocities up to 2500 meters/second to support high speed (up to Mach 8) munition concepts.  (3) High Level Program Description:  A ground profiling, foliage penetration, precision HOB fuze sensor will be developed, fabricated, and tested in realistic environments.  This program will deliver two distinct capabilities:  (a) a precision HOB ground profiling, and foliage penetration capable fuze sensor in a tail-mounted configuration, and (b) a foliage penetration HOB upgrade for the DSU-33B/B proximity fuze sensor in nose-mount, tactical  form factor to support the TUT program.  (4) Technical Requirements and Goals:  As stated in section (2), two distinct capabilities will be developed, fabricated, tested and delivered.  The FAST sensor tail-mounted version requirements are as follows:  (a) Tail-mounted fuze sensor that will not interfere with the use of nose-mounted guidance concepts; (b) Capable of having electronically selectable HOBs up to 20 meters in increments of 0.5 meters; (c) Capable of providing HOB, NSB, initial time of impact (T0) and initial velocity at impact (V0) information that could be used with tail-mounted fuzes on unitary weapons; (d) Operation in adverse weather and battlefield obscurants, including foliage; (e) Operation in battlefield EMI/ECM, including mutual interference; and (f) Launch-to-Burst Point weapon simulation.  The FAST sensor tail-mounted version goals are as follows:  (a) Less than 0.5  meter error in determining its correct, preset HOB above the ground contour, regardless of target structure and background; (b) Operate in blast/fragment and penetration weapon systems having ground profiling at velocities from 50-1250 meters/second, and determining T0 & V0 at velocities up to 2500 meters/second; (c) Provide a NSB mode that will detonate the weapon just prior to warhead ground impact, 0-80 degree impact angles, and (d) Production Cost for all up tail-mounted fuze sensor capability desired to be under $2,000 each in large quantities (20,000 units).  The TUT foliage penetration, nose-mounted version requirements are as follows:  (a) Nose-mounted foliage penetrating fuze sensor that can operate at 0-80 degree impact angles, with closing velocity of 50-500 meters/second, operate in clear terrain, and light to heavy foliage, and be in DSU-33B/B form factor (or smaller); (b) Capable of having selectable HOBs up to 20 meters in increments of 0.5 meters; (c) Use the same interface as the DSU-33B/B; (d) Operate in adverse weather and battlefield obscurants, including foliage; (e) Operate in battlefield EMI/ECM, including mutual interference; and (f) Launch-to-Burst Point Weapon Simulation.  The TUT foliage penetration, nose-mounted version goals are as follows:  (a) Less than 0.5 meter error in determining its correct, preset HOB above the ground level; (b) Provide a NSB mode that will detonate the weapon just prior to warhead ground impact, 0-80 degree impact angles; and (c) Production Cost for nose-mounted fuze sensor capability desired to be under $1,500 each in large quantities (20,000 units).  (5) Program Tasking:  This development effort will consist of a Basic Award plus one Option that includes three parts (funding permitting).  The Basic Award will include both the Nose-mount and Tail-mount configuration designs, and a 10-month performance period that culminates in a Critical Design Review (CDR).  Technical results of the CDR will determine if the Option to continue the program should be exercised.  The Option, if exercised, is expected to bear a 24-month performance period, and include fabrication, test, and demonstration of:  Part A - Nose-mount version in tactical form factor; Part B - Tail-mount full up version; and Part C - Hardware and Software Components common to both Parts A and B.  Funding permitting, all three parts will be awarded as part of the Option.  However, if funding is insufficient to award all three parts, it is expected that Part C and one other Part will be awarded under the Option.  Thus, each of the three parts in the Option must be priced separately.  Pending inclusion in the Option, the nose-mount configuration tasking should be completed, through field-testing, no later than the 4th quarter of FY04.  The tail-mount configuration tasking should be completed, through field-testing, no later than the 3rd quarter of FY05.  (6) Fabrication of Hardware:  Pending inclusion in the Option, the contractor shall fabricate:  (a) all nose-mount configuration hardware in DSU-33B/B form factor according to the DSU-33 B/B Technical Data Package provided in the PRDA annex [desired nose-mount hardware includes one field test unit, and three tactical units ready for real-time drop testing]; and (b)  all tail-mount configuration hardware based on a Mk-82 sized conceptual tail cone.  [desired tail-mount hardware includes one field test unit that could be attached to a real or surrogate Mk-82 sized bomb body]  (7) Test Support:  If the Option is exercised, the contractor shall plan, schedule, conduct and/or support all aspects of the required testing, except as otherwise specified in this PRDA.  The contractor shall be responsible for all test plans necessary for the maturation and demonstration of the hardware and software products to be tested.  Contractor-generated test plans, as approved by the Government, will become contractual requirements.  When and if tests are conducted at Government facilities, the contractor shall be responsible for providing technical support, analysis, data, and test planning support to the identified responsible Government test organization.  (8) Affordability Tasking:  The contractor shall plan and implement an affordability program using the principles of Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD).  The contractor should address affordability as a key consideration in the development and demonstration of the two distinct program capabilities previously identified.  (Note:  A description and discussion of the IPPD Process Model can be found at http://www.jgai.com/stprocess50/index.htm).

<DESC>The Library of Congress has a requirement as per the following statement of work:

Professional Music Librarian Consultant Services


NLS Music Library Services

A special music collection for blind and physically handicapped individuals was authorized by Congress in 1962 as part of the free national library program of braille and recorded books and magazines administered by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS), Library of Congress.  This collection contains some 20,000 titles and consists of music scores in braille and large-print formats and music magazines and books about music and musicians in large-print, braille, and recorded formats.

Music reader advisory, reference, and circulation services are provided by the NLS Music Section.  NLS music library services are a major resource for blind, partially sighted, and physically handicapped musicians, music students, and others who enjoy music.  Informational services are delivered by way of the telephone, electronic mail, or regular mail.  Special format circulating materials - braille and large print music and books about music and instructional music recordings -  are shipped to and from program patrons by postage-free mail. 

NLS is the only provider of specialized music library services and materials for blind and physically handicapped individuals in the United States. Since it is the only such resource, NLS music patrons express needs typical of all types of music library users, including public, conservatory, and university music library users. The range of patron interests includes all kinds of popular music, learning to play instruments by ear or from reading music notation, music appreciation, textbooks and teaching materials, and standard classical music repertoire for voice and a full range of instruments.

Description of Services to Be Provided

Summary

Professional music librarian consultant services (one individual), eight hours a day, weekdays.  A total of 1120 hours to cover 140 consecutive workdays.  Services to include coverage of a set schedule of two hours of live  reader advisory and reference service will be provided.   All work will be performed at 1291 Taylor St., NW, Washington, DC.  

First Priority Services:

	Live telephone advisory and reference service: on a schedule of at least 2 hours a day, preferably in the afternoon.

	Mail advisory and reference service and follow-ups to live telephone services: 2 hours a day, either early and/or late afternoon hours, weekdays.

	Coordination of telephone requests and circulation services with Office Automation Assistants.

Most music patrons call the toll-free number but a small number may call one of the Music Section direct numbers. Users of the toll-free number either leave a message in the Section's voice mailbox or (between 8:00-4:30, weekdays) ask the NLS operator to transfer their call to the Music Section or a particular music staff member.  Most patron calls come in during the afternoon hours because of time zone differences, although messages may be left in the voice mailbox twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.  Most contacts for materials and services are received by telephone. A few are received through regular mail and an increasing number are received by email.
Second Priority Services:

Coordinate (in consultation with the Section Head) shelf reading, weeding, and reorganization of music collection: 2 hours per day, morning or afternoon.

Work with section staff to examine, correct, and verify shelf contents of the music collections; recommending to Section Head the weeding and replacement of acquisitions; and monitoring the reorganization of music collection stacks according to a systematic plan.

The entire national collection of braille scores and books in braille and large print and titles in audio format is housed at NLS/BPH. Due to long-term staffing shortages, this collection is now in critical need of shelf reading, weeding, and reorganization.

Third Priority Services:

Updating of content of music catalogs and bibliographies:
	
	Music Circular No. 3, Piano Methods in braille, May, 1993
	Music Circular No. 16, Opera Librettos and Lectures, Sept. 1995
			Compilation of title lists from various large print collections
	Updating other key circulars and bibliographies as determined by reader requests and the Section Head.

The NLS Music Section has a number of music reference circulars that serve as catalog supplements or provide often-requested information on high interest topics.  Due to long-term and strategic staff shortages, many of these have not been updated either in printed form or on the Internet for several years.

If time permits and the consultant has desk-top publishing knowledge and experience, updated camera-ready masters will be produced, sent for approval, etc., prior to copies being provided to the general public and the revised circular being posted on the NLS web page.

Fourth Priority Services

Quality assurance of any large-print book or large-print music production; providing assistance in evaluating software to perform braille music translation through preparation of print music notation samples using music editing software.

Large Print ?  Large-print books are produced by photo enlargement. The production of camera-ready large print music scores includes making an electronic file of the music notation and reformatting and printing this on 11" x 17" pages. This process introduces the possibility of errors in the literary text and music notation and in the music notation editing.

Quality assurance procedures involve sampling (i.e., only a certain percentage of pages will be checked) and a team approach, with different team members being responsible for checking specific aspects of the proofs and copies. Production schedules will be established in collaboration with contractors; these schedules require NLS to perform the necessary quality assurance review steps within a reasonable but nevertheless limited time-frame. Quality assurance assignments to the consultant will be made on an as-necessary basis when section staff need assistance in order to meet deadlines.

Braille Translation ? the use of computers promises to play an increasingly important role in the production of music notation in braille. Because of its Congressional mandate to maintain and develop a collection of braille music scores, NLS is greatly interested in exploring the conversion of computer files of print music into their braille music equivalents.

Music notation software is used to prepare notation which is then processed by computer programs that convert these files into braille music notation.


Qualifications of Consultant



Minimum:

1.	Demonstrated success and facility in conducting reference type interviews and in working with the general public.

2.	Evidence of a broad and currently active knowledge of music and music literature at a bachelor's degree or equivalent level.

3.	Demonstrated ability effectively to use as appropriate the Music Section card, paper, and electronic catalogs, reference notes, internet and electronic resources, and foreign language thematic catalogs and print reference publications.

4.	A knowledge of basic music reference tools.

5.        Knowledge of or ability to learn to use music notation software.

Highly Desirable:

1.	Bachelor's or graduate degree in music.

2.	Master's degree in library science.

3.	Successful public service experience in a music library.

4.	Successful experience in coordinating the work of other people.


Deliverables

1.	Music readers advisory and reference service, 250 hours scheduled live service and approximately 400 hours research, mail processing, telephone follow ups, etc., as needed to be responsive to NLS music reader needs.

2.	Shelf reading/reorganization service to examine, correct, and verify shelf contents of the music collections, according to the project work plan.

3.	Revised and compiled content for two music circular revisions: circular numbers 3 and 16; complied title lists for various large print collections in the NLS holdings; other key circulars and bibliography updates as determined by reader requests and section head.  The necessary data will be gleaned from a variety of sources such as order files, shelf lists, reference notes, and electronic sources and web sites.  The extent of this deliverable will depend on the time left after deliverable one and two requirements are met.

4.	Quality assurance review service for large-print books and camera-ready music proofs and final copy; and preparation service for print music samples of passages prepared with a music notation editor for use by automated braille music translation programs.   NLS requirements will be provided.  Scheduled as needed.

Bidders must include with their bid resumes of two to five individuals who would be available for the work should they be the successful bidder.  NLS reserves the right to interview and select the particular individual that would be performing the work, choosing from the individuals whose resumes are provided.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), is soliciting comments on its proposed approach to Phase II of a cost-shared, public-private project to develop cost effective large wind turbine (> 100 kilowatt) technology for low wind speed resource sites throughout the United States.

Background

Current cost of energy (COE) levels for wind energy have been achieved by focusing development on CClass lass 6 wind resource sites (average wind speeds of 6.7 m/s @10 m height) and by taking advantage of the Production production Tax tax Credit credit (1.7 ?/kWh in 2002 $).  With favorable financial terms, such Class Class 6 sites can market electricity at prices of 4 ?/kWh or less, before the subsidy.  However, as more and more sites have beensites are developed, easily accessible prime CClass 6 sites that are easily accessible have begunare disappearing.  In addition, many CClass 6 sites are located in remote areas that do not have easy access to transmission lines.  The full development of accessible CClass 6 sites may cause wind energy growth to plateau in the near future unless improvements in technology can make lower wind speed sites more cost effective.

Class 4 wind sites (5.8 m/s @10 m) cover vast areas of the Great Plains from central and northern Texas to the Canadian border.  Almost all of Class 4 sites are also found along many coastal areas in and along the shores of the Great Lakes and along shallow coastal areas of the eastern United States.  While the average distance of CClass 6 sites from major load centers is average 500 miles, from major load centers, CClass 4 sites are significantly closer, with an averaging average distance of 100 miles in distancefrom the load centers., Tthus, making utility access to the Class 4 sites is more attractive and less costly.  Also, CClass 4 sites represent almost 20 times the developable wind resource of CClass 6 sites.  Currently wind energy at CClass 4 sites can be marketed at prices in the range of 5 to 6 ?/kWh. 

2.1 	Low Wind Speed Technology (LWST) Goal and Strategy

The Federal Wind Energy program has defined goals for its technology development activities that will position wind as an attractive advanced technology option for the twenty-first century.  The LWST goal is:
?	Reduce cost of energy from large wind systems to 3 ?/kWh in CClass 6 wind resources by 2004, and to 3 ?/kWh in CClass 4 wind resources by 2010.  (compared to a 2002 baseline of 4 ?/kWh in CClass 6, and 5.5 ?/kWh in CClass 4)

In 2001, the DOE Wind Energy Program launched a major new effort to reach the LWST goal.  The program currently envisions that the LWST project will represent an increasingly large portion of total program funds over the remainder of this decade.  The strategy for the LLow WWind SSpeed TTechnology (LWST) project shown below was developed in cooperation with industry, and guided by several principles:

?	Public/private partnerships will be developed to support continuing innovation.  They will be flexible and adaptive, support multiple pathways, and offer repeated opportunities for new players to enter the program.  
?	Program research and testing activities will be closely aligned to support public/private partnerships.
?	Applied systems integration activities will guide portfolio planning and technology transfer.
?	The Pprogram will be evaluatedions performed regularly using performance-based management techniques and will have provide a strong analytical basis for performance criteria, periodic review, and adjustment.

A Phase I rRequest for pProposals (RFP) under the LLow WWind SSpeed TTechnology (LWST) pProject was  issued on October 19, 2001. The RFP offered bidders an opportunity to participate in one of three technical areas;, including 1) Concept and Scaling studies, 2) Component Development, and 3) Prototype Turbine Development.  Two proposals were selected under each of these technical areas for negotiations leading to NREL subcontract awards.

Solicitation Plan

Consistent with the described plan, the DOE is planning the release of another RFP in the early Spring of 2003 (representing Phase II of the LWST project).  At this time, the program envisions an RFP structured much like the initial request.  There will be three options open to bidders.  1)  Conceptual Design Studies, 2) Component Development Projects, and 3) Prototype Turbine Development.

Conceptual Design Studies (Technical Area 1) are envisioned as 4-6 month efforts with the maximum DOE funding being $200,000 for any single award.  The program intends to use a cost reimbursable type of subcontract, and cost sharing will not be required of participants under Conceptual Design Studies subcontracts.  However, proposals for Conceptual Design Studies that do propose cost sharing above the $200,000 will be considered.

Component Development (Technical Area 2) is envisioned as a 2-3 year effort with the maximum DOE funding being $3 million for any single award. LWST Prototype Development (Technical Area 3) is envisioned as a 2-3 year effort with the maximum DOE funding being $6 million for any single award. Initial prototype wind turbines are expected to operate by 2007 and the final LWST, which will be funded under a Phase III solicitation, is expected to operate by 2009. These expectations do not preclude an offeror from proposing projects of different duration or cost.

For Component Development subcontracts, the minimum direct cost sharing (by the Offeror) required of industry participants will be 30%.  For LWST Prototype Development subcontracts, the minimum direct cost sharing (by the Offeror) required of industry participants will be 50%.  Additional consideration in the evaluation process will be given for cost sharing in excess of these amounts. 

The program would expect to award 1-3 subcontracts in each area of participation (Technical Area).  Each project will be funded incrementally on an annual fiscal year basis. Throughout the projects, the program will encourage the use of best business and project-management practices. Disciplined engineering development processes, including rigorous laboratory and field tests to verify component and subsystem designs, will be emphasized. 

The RFP will require an offeror to describe its proposed concept in sufficient detail to be understood and evaluated by a group of knowledgeable reviewers.  Offerors must also identify the planned teaming arrangements, budget, and schedule for their proposed projects.  The program expects a majority of the subcontract work to be performed within the United States, and offerors will be asked to demonstrate the economic benefits of the proposed project to the United States.  This RFP will be focused on large scale turbine design for utility grid interconnection.  These important requirements will be among the program policy factors considered in evaluating and ranking the submittals.  Qualified business and technical professionals will evaluate these written proposals, which will be restricted to a maximum of 20 pages.  Awards will be based upon technical feasibility, projected COE, offeror?s capabilities, and likelihood of achieving program goals and objectives.  Unsuccessful bidders from the previous solicitation are welcomed to resubmit unsuccessful proposals or submit modified proposals.

Expressions of Interest

The purpose of this pre-solicitation notice is to obtain an indication of the level of interest by industry participants in the project described in the Solicitation Plan.  Therefore, expressions of interest are sought from potential respondents to the forthcoming RFP, and comments on the proposed plan and scope-of-work are sought from all interested parties.  Because the LWST project targets bulk-electricity generation, the program is interested in comments from potential developers, owners, operators, utilities, and manufacturers.  This notice is also intended to promote the formation of industry partnerships and to stimulate interaction among potential participants.  Failure to respond to this notice will not disqualify anyone from participation in the solicitation, but those that do respond to this notice are assured of receiving the RFP and notification of related activities, if they indicate that desire.  Expressions of interest should not include detailed proposals, but should include the following information: 1) the names, addresses, telephone numbers, and facsimile numbers of the primary contact person and key collaborators, 2) the potential participants, their affiliations, and their proposed roles, 3) comments on the proposed plan, scope-of-work, cost-sharing, and funding, and 4) a statement indicating whether or not the respondent wishes to receive a copy of the RFP.  Responses to this notice should not exceed five pages and they should be received at NREL by December 6, 2002.  This is not a request for proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service International requires service Blanket Purchase Agreements for a variety of Hazardous Waste (HW) management functions (e.g. inspecting, proper identification, packaging, loading, removal, transportation, unloading, storage (if permissible), pierside removals, and disposal/recycling of both hazardous and non-hazardous regulated wastes from various military installations in South West Asia (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Oman - Note:  Additional locations/countries may be added in South West Asia and/or Africa).  Additional services include chemical sampling and analysis, waste profiling, waste segregation and packaging, preparation of waste turn-in documentation, exercise and contingency support, expedited removals and the supply of 200 liter containers, overpacks and big bags.  Waste must be disposed of in compliance with the Basel Convention.  SP4420-03-R-0001 will be issued on or about 21 November 2002.  Approximate closing date is 21 December 2002.  These BPAs will have a 12 month period of performance, with four 12 month option periods.  Performance will be requested by issuance of written Call Orders against the BPA.  Qualifications: prospective contractors or subcontractors must be able to meet all applicable national and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as any applicable international agreements governing the transport, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes.  International regulations shall apply to the transboundary movement of wastes from one country to another.  The final contract award decision will be based on a combination of price and other factors described in the solicitation.  Note:  Local (in-country) disposal is the preferred method for disposal; regional (in-theater) disposal is the second preferred method.  Offerors that propose in-country disposal and in-theater disposal will be evaluated as being technically superior to those that propose out-of-country or out-of-theater (i.e. outside of South West Asia) disposal; this will be listed as part of the evaluation criteria in the solicitation.  No telephone requests for the solicitation package will be accepted.  POC e-mail: ecrown@wiesbaden-ex.drms.dla.mil.  See Numbered Note 26.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Questions and Answers # 1

Q.	Are there specifications available?

A.	There are no specifications available for this solicitation.  This is a build-from-the-ground-up item.  The only specifications are the ones already in the synopsis/solicitation.

Q.	How may stands are needed for this project?

A.	One set of stands is required for this project.  It is up to the individual companies to determine how many individual stands will make a complete tail set.

Q.	Are there drawings for this combined synopsis/solicitation?

A.	The government has no drawings for this solicitation.  We are requiring offerors to submit drawings for this project to determine its technical acceptability.

Q.	Will there be an ombudsman assigned to help vendors with thorough specifications?

A.	There will be no one assigned to vendors.  The site visit should answer most questions.  Again, this is a build-from-the-ground-up project.  The government is looking to the vendor to provide something that will be feasible for our maintenance personnel.


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation (F17EMS22590500) is issued as a request for quotations.  This solicitation as well as all provisions and clauses are current through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-08.  Date of delivery is 180 days after receipt of order and FOB point is 7 EMS, Dyess AFB, TX 79607.  Offers are due to 7th Contracting Squadron, 381 3rd St, Dyess AFB, TX 79607 not later than 1630 or 4:30 P.M. central standard time on 6 November 2002.  This is for the purposes of procuring tail maintenance stands for use on the B-1 Bomber.  Dyess B-1 Maintenance Flight is in need of better work stands to enable maintenance personnel to have better access to the aircraft.  The stands shall be constructed of modular units with easy upgrading, low maintenance and easy maneuverability with workers safety in mind at all times.  There will be a SITE VISIT on 25 October 2002 at 0900 hours or 9 A.M central standard time.  All offerors will be REQUIRED to submit conceptual drawings at time of quote submission.  Failure to do so will result in offeror being disqualified.  The following are a few guidelines 7th EMS is looking for in the wing maintenance stands.

The stands must be designed to meet or exceed the direction found in ?AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 21-101 AEROSPACE EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT (01 FEB 2002),: ?AIR FORCE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS 91-2 VEHICLE ELEVATING AND ROTATING WORK PLATFORMS, MANUALLY-PROPELLED AND SELF PROPELLED MOBILE WORK PLATFORMS, AND SCAFFOLDS (TOWERS) (01 AUG 1997), ?AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 91-301 AIR COMBAT COMMAND SUPPLEMENT 1 AIR FORCE OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY, FIRE PREVENTION, AND HEALTH (AFOSH) PROGRAM (04 DEC 1997).  

Units must be entirely constructed of non-corrosive lightweight steel/aluminum.  Each unit must be mobile and easily moved and positioned by four people or less.  Units will have manually operated vertical movement jacks allowing a minimum of 18 inches of variable height adjustments for platform leveling. Stands will allow access to the tail section of the B-1 aircraft from approximately 6 feet forward of the Mixer bays to the aft section of lower rudder. They should also allow personnel to walk under the horizontal stabilizers to allow maintenance.

Stands should allow movement and positioning of a universal maintenance stand at the aft of aircraft and also allow for the removal of aircraft engines.

The casters should swivel 360 degrees with 90 degree locking points and manually operated foot brakes.  Tires should be made of solid polyurethane molded to the cast wheel. Step-fast jacks should also be used to take out any caster movement when stands are in position.  

Segment should be approximately 30 feet long by 20 feet wide providing approximately 600 square feet of usable workspace.  Tail sections should be no more than one section per side and no more than two stages, it should also allow walking from one side of the aircraft to the other (bridge from stand to stand with hand rails) without dismounting.  Segments must provide access to the Stab, lower rudders and flight control bays (mixer-bay).  Each segment will be capable of holding a minimum of six 200-pound individuals.  Each segment shall have collapsible handrails for fall protection.  There will be toe-boards a minimum of 4 inches high surrounding the work decks to prevent small items from rolling or being kicked over the edge.  The interface edge between the aircraft and the work deck will be adjustable to allow for aircraft contour and will not have toe-boards.  The adjustable edge-mating surface must be covered in a non-marking rubber material to prevent damage to the aircraft skin (each fingers will extend 2-3 ft).

Stands must be sturdy enough to be towed by a small vehicle as they are used in different hangars on base for stab removals.  Each stand must have a tow bar attachment (tow bar must be able to receive a pindle hook type of attachment).

Each stand will have access stairs to the work platform.  The stairs should allow for treads to remain in the horizontal position when the deck height is raised or lowered.  Each stair should have handrails fitted to each side.  There should also be a hand-operated jack to remove any movement of the stair casters.  Stair treads should be lightweight and the facing edge of the treads and top landing must be highlighted with yellow paint.

Operating instructions will be clearly defined on signs located close to the relevant piece of equipment, such as jacks.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for operation and maintenance services for the Alaska Radar System.  The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and maintenance of the radar sites in the Alaska Radar System, as described below.  You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), (ii) Statement of Objectves (SOO) v. Statement of Work (SOW), and (iii) commercial practices; standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired.  Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for all operation and maintenance of the manned and unmanned AN/FPS-117 long-range radars and the AN/FPS/124 unattended short range radars, as well as the site facilities (real property, real property installed equipment, and utility systems) at approximately 18 remote Alaska locations on Alaska's northern and western coasts and mountain interior (access by air, seasonal access by barge).  The contractor will also be responsible for the Maintenance Control and Communications Center and for certain equipment in the Regional Air Operations Center at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.  Radar operations and maintenance, and other communications-electronics systems, is the core of the requirement, but facilities support is also critical to mission success.  The contractor is responsible for maintenance and snow removal for seven gravel airstrips, many miles of gravel roads, tram systems at several sites, utilities, water and sewage systems, power generation, and environmental protection.  Transportation, logistics, food service and housekeeping, and weather operations are also important elements of operation.  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the summer of 2003, with award in the January-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise on radars, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The contracting officer invites input as to whether 513390 for radar station operations is not a more appropriate NAICS.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 8 October 2002.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is seeking solicitations of interest for the Weapons Evaluation Test Laborotory (WETL) construction project at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, TX, roughly estimated at $8.5 Million.    

The WETL facility will be approximately 31,400 gross square feet, including approximately 21,000 sf of secure laboratory/testing areas.  The facility will include private and open office areas, computer support areas, video/teleconference presentation room, static free rooms, boom room, explosive lab, chemistry lab, electronics testing areas, two belowground high speed centrifuge areas (centrifuge equipment by Government) and miscellaneous support spaces.  The facility has been designed and will be constructed using The Green Building Council's LEED's criteria for sustainable design and will be submitted for certification. Facility commissioning will be required.

The WETL will be a steel-framed structure with slab on grade concrete flooring, outside of centrifuge areas, and open-web steel roof joists. A reinforced concrete floor will be provided over the centrifuge areas. Foundations will be individual spread footings with cast-in-place grade beams.  Cast in place concrete walls and floors are used for the belowground centrifuge levels.  The facility will require material hoists, a bridge crane and blast resistant wall/door construction for various spaces. Roofing will be steel deck with built-up roofing. Exterior skin will be factory fabricated, preinsulated metal sandwich panels.  The facility will utilize variable air volume air handling systems with packaged rooftop DX cooling with hot water heating and hot water terminal units. Miscellaneous exhaust systems will be required. Plumbing systems will consist of sanitary, domestic hot and cold water, compressed air and liquid CO2 distribution systems. Facility will be provided with both wet and dry-pipe sprinkler systems. Electrical systems will consist of primary power, telecommunications, public address, security, fire detection/alarm, video teleconferencing, centrifuge access control and monitoring, operations monitoring, oxygen monitoring and other miscellaneous support systems. 

The below grade levels will support two large high-speed centrifuges to be relocated by the Government.  The successful Contractor will be responsible for coordinating centrifuge installation requirements with the Government's Specialty Contractors. The facility will be provided with power and HVAC systems to support the high heat dissipation and electrical requirements of the Government's test equipment.  

BWXT Pantex, LLC, operates the Pantex Plant; however SNL will operate the WETL facility and will be the contracting agency for procurement and administration of the construction contract. BWXT will support SNL in the areas of construction inspections and Pantex Plant construction requirements. Hayes, Seay, Mattern & Mattern, Inc. of Roanoke, VA is the architect-engineer and will provide shop drawing reviews and other construction phase services in support of SNL.

The majority of construction site is outside of the existing high security areas at the Pantex Plant, which will allow the majority of the construction to be completed under minimal security requirements. Work within the higher security areas to relocate existing equipment, install temporary fencing and to connect to existing utilities will need to be completed in accordance with the Pantex Plant security requirements. Prior to project completion the facility will be incorporated into the high security area.


A fixed price construction contract is anticipated to be awarded in January 2003, with an anticipated 70 week schedule for completion. All interested firms should submit a letter of interest, which includes demonstrated capability of meeting the criteria in this announcement, together with ten (10) copies of their qualifications. The qualficiations submittal should include descriptions of past jobs of similar scope and complexity with contact names to verify contractor performance.  The qualifications submittal is limited to 10 double-sided pages.  The submittals will be evaluated by a committee of WETL project team personnel, who will "shortlist" based on the following criteria (listed in order of importance).

1.	Similar Experience by the Construction contractor - Project specific relevance to the WETL Facility (include references for each project).  List no more than 3 projects.

2.	Management Plan and Approach - Discuss your strategy for staffing this project.  Include Project Manager, Superintendent, Safety officer, Commissioning agent, discipline leads and key support personnel roles, responsibilities and interfaces, including project team organization and overall management plan.

3.	Experience of Team Members - Professional Designation/Certification/Education and Technical Experience (It is expected that team members identified in the proposal will perform the work and will be involved throughout the WETL project). 

4.	Quality Management - Internal QA Process.

5.	Methodology and Performance of Cost Estimating, Schedule and Cost Control.  Include experience with P3 Project Planner.  This will be required during the Construction Phase.

  
Only those "shortlisted" will receive the actual Request for Quotation (RFQ).  All qualification submittals must be delivered in writing, organized and tabulated per the listed criteria sequence. No telephone or fax proposals will be accepted. Proposals are due by 3:00 p.m. MST, November 11, 2002. Submittals and any questions should be directed to Sandia National Laboratories, Attention: Jimmy Romero, mail stop 0222, 1515 Eubank SE Albuquerque, New Mexico 87123-0222.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Richmond is looking for manufacturers to participate in the Just In Time Bushing Program for Naval Aircraft.  We anticipate requiring uncoated bushings to be delivered within 3 working days, CAD plated bushings to be delivered within 5 working days, and IVD coated bushings to be delivered within 14 calendar days.  All bushings will require Non Destructive Inspection (NDI) prior to shipment.

The anticipated scope of the proposed contract will include, but not be limited to, all bushings in the aircraft maintained by the Naval Aviation Depots.  The bushings will be solicited in phases.  Only those manufacturers that are found qualified during the initial solicitation will be considered for the follow-on proposals.

The minimally acceptable on-time delivery history in the 3120 class is 90%.  Those that have not performed work in the 3120 federal supply class will be judged based on the government contracts they receive.  Manufacturers not meeting this standard will not be considered for contract award.  Additionally, any perspective manufacturers must have a minimum of three (3) CNC lathes and three (3) CNC mills.

?	Draft course evaluation 

Course I, USAF Unique requirements

	The below curriculum content is for estimation purposes and additional information may be included during the formal curriculum development phase.  

1.	Elements of the AFOSH program and responsibilities**
a.	Reference. Air Force Instruction 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, And Health (AFOSH) Program
b.	Purpose. To minimize loss of Air Force resources and to protect Air Force people from occupational deaths, injuries, or illnesses by managing risks.
c.	Scope. AFOSH program guidance applies to all areas, except where otherwise prescribed or specified in Status-of-Forces Agreements or military-unique situations specifically exempted in this instruction. Distinctions will not be made between the requirements for military and civilian personnel.
d.	Regulatory Federal Standards. The Air Force complies with the intent of standards from the Department of Labor (DOL) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Standards, Environmental Protection Agency, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Transportation Standards by directly referencing the applicable standards or incorporating the standards in AFOSH standards, Technical Orders or directives.
e.	Comply with Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) guidance.
f.	Promptly report safety, fire, and health hazards and deficiencies.
g.	Promptly report injuries and illnesses to the supervisor.
h.	Comply with personal protective equipment requirements that apply to the work situation, including its use, inspection, and care.
i.	Give due consideration to personal safety and the safety of fellow workers while doing assigned tasks.
j.	Have the opportunity to:
i.	Take part in the AFOSH program without fear of coercion, discrimination, or reprisal.
ii.	Request inspections of unsafe or unhealthful working conditions or report those conditions to the supervisor, safety manager, fire protection specialist, or BE, including OSHA officials.
iii.	Have access to applicable OSHA and AFOSH standards, installation injury and illness statistics, safety, fire protection, and health program procedures, and their own exposure and medical records.
iv.	Decline to perform an assigned task because of a reasonable belief that the task poses an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm. The person and local management may request an assessment by installation safety, fire protection, or health professionals before proceeding.
v.	Use official on-duty time to take part in AFOSH program activities.
2.	USAF Operational Risk Management (ORM)**
a.	Reference.  Air Force Instruction 90-901, Operational Risk Management
b.	Definition, Purpose, and Scope. Operational risk management is a decision-making process to systematically evaluate possible courses of action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action for any given situation. ORM enables commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals to maximize operational capabilities while limiting all dimensions of risk by applying a simple, systematic process appropriate for all personnel and functions both on- and off-duty.
c.	Goals:
i.	Enhance mission effectiveness at all levels, while preserving assets and safeguarding health and welfare.
ii.	Integrate ORM into mission processes; ensuring decisions are based upon assessments of risk integral to the activity and mission.
iii.	Create an Air Force in which every leader, airman, and employee is trained and motivated to manage risk in all their on- and off-duty activities.
iv.	Identify opportunities to increase Air Force war fighting effectiveness on the battlefield and in the operational aerospace environment, helping to ensure decisive victory in any future conflict at the least possible cost.
d.	ORM Principles. Four principles govern all actions associated with the management of risk. These principles, continuously employed, are applicable before, during, and after all tasks and operations.
i.	Accept no unnecessary risk. Unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate return in terms of real benefits or available opportunities. All Air Force missions and daily routines involve risk. The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are those that meet all mission requirements while exposing personnel and resources to the lowest acceptable risk.
ii.	Make risk decisions at the appropriate level. Making risk decisions at the appropriate level establishes clear accountability. Those accountable for the success or failure of the mission must be included in the risk decision process.
iii.	Accept risk when benefits outweigh the costs. All potential benefits should be compared to all potential costs. The process of weighing risks against opportunities and benefits helps to maximize unit capability. Even high-risk endeavors may be undertaken when there is a well-founded basis to believe that the sum of the benefits exceeds the sum of the costs.
iv.	Integrate ORM into operations and planning at all levels. To effectively apply risk management, commanders must dedicate time and resources to integrate ORM principles into planning and operational processes. Risk assessments of operations are most mission supportive when they are done as a normal way of conducting a mission, not an add-on process performed by people not otherwise involved.
e.	ORM Fundamentals. The essential concepts of Air Force ORM are outlined below. ORM:
i.	Is a comprehensive system for improving individual and organizational performance in all functional areas and operations.
ii.	Should be tailored to meet the unique mission needs and operational requirements of each organization.
iii.	Provides the process and tools to develop and enhance awareness and understanding of at-risk activities and behavior of personnel both on- and off-duty.
iv.	Application may identify areas where regulatory guidance is overly restrictive or otherwise not consistent with mission requirements. In this event, the risk assessment may be used to support solicitation of appropriate level waiver, variance, or change, but will not in itself constitute authority to violate any directive, policy, standard, or other applicable regulatory guidance.
v.	Is a continuous, systematic decision-making tool consisting of six steps that define the process. The following is a description of the six-step process.
1.	Identify the Hazards. Step one of the process involves application of appropriate hazard identification techniques in order to identify hazards associated with the operation or activity. Hazard can be defined as any real or potential condition that can cause mission degradation.
2.	Assess the Risk. The assessment step involves the application of quantitative or qualitative measures to determine the probability and severity of ill effects potentially resulting from exposure to a hazard. 
3.	Analyze Risk Control Measures. Step three involves the evaluation of specific strategies and controls that reduce or eliminate risk. Effective mitigation measures reduce one of the three components (probability, severity or exposure) of risk.
 

SST Traffic Safety Module

The SST Traffic Safety Module will consist of two, 1-hour, modules taught to military and civilian personnel when initially assigned to a supervisory position. Background of students vary but generally students are both male and female between the ages of 22 ? 26 years of age.  Military ranks are between SSgt ? Lieutenants while civilians grades are between GS ? 7 through GS ?11.  The class size ranges from 10 ? 30 students.  The goal of the SST Traffic Safety Module is to prevent or reduce frequency and severity of vehicular mishaps involving Air Force personnel and equipment. Overall focus is to provide new supervisors with a working knowledge of their basic safety responsibilities as they pertain to their subordinate?s safety while in a traffic environment.  



Objectives:  Upon completion of the SST Traffic Safety Module students should at a minimum be able to: 

1.	Identify basic principles of USAF Traffic Safety Program and supervisory responsibilities**
2.	Identify elements of Driver Improvement Training and Commander/1st Sergeant/Supervisor roles**
3.	Name basic principles of safe driving 
4.	Identify an employee?s unsafe driving habits, techniques, and behavioral patterns
5.	Identify hazardous driving conditions and appropriate methods for changing employee?s unsafe driving habits, techniques, and behavioral patterns that cause unsafe acts 
6.	Describe appropriate behind-the-wheel responses to employees while driving in hazardous conditions
7.	Identify the effects of inexperience, risk taking and poor judgment on a family and combat capabilities
8.	Identify the effects of peer influence, risky vehicle operations and the ability to capitalize on peer influence to reduce risk

**Subjects that are USAF unique, USAF will provide necessary consultation during development. 

Instructional methodologies for the SST Traffic Safety Module should encompass a facilitated guided discussion (interactive lecture), supplemented by multimedia presentations, role playing, small group activities, video, and class discussion.

Deliverables for the SST Traffic Safety Module will include:

o	Design Plan
o	Class syllabus
o	Facilitator guides/lesson plans
o	Student handouts and/or provide digital or reproducible handouts summarizing the course for supervisory personnel
o	Multimedia presentations
o	List of equipment needed to conduct the course (TV/VCR, flip charts, markers, pens, pencils, screen, desk, # of electrical outlets, infocus machines, etc.)
o	Supplemental written material
o	Draft evaluation
o	Final camera-ready/digital copies of all draft materials

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division  (NOTSD) requires design, development, fabrication, installation, and testing of a Virginia Class Submarine (VSSN) Ship Control Maintenance Trainer (VSCMT), to be delivered to NAVSUBSCOL, New London, CT. The VSSN Ship Control System (SCS) provides for the control of the ship's depth, trim angle, and heading from the Ship Control Station located in the Command and Control Center (CACC). The system concept for the required training is to use the operational DMAC hardware and software in conjunction with an Interactive Student Workstation. This will be used in combination with the operational Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) to provide detailed instruction on SCS maintenance procedures and DMAC operation down to the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). This arrangement will be used in lieu of the conventional approach of inserting and finding faults in actual tactical equipment. The instructor at the IOS will accomplish fault selection for the six student stations. The VSCMT system design is based on the following components:  1.  Instructor Operator Station (IOS);  2. Interactive Student Workstation to interface with the Instructor Station and to simulate the VSSN RIC's functions, with a minimum of 100 simulated SCS system faults, total estimated SLOC for Ship Control System, including DMAC is approximately 55,000;   3.  Diagnostic Maintenance Computer (DMAC);  4.  IETM.  Items 2, 3, and 4 constitute a Student Station (SS).  The VSCMT trainer will have six SSs. The scope of the DMAC Build 7 code and unit test effort is estimated to be 27,500 SLOC at completion.  Build 7 development and delivery has been subdivided into Block 0 and Block 1 deliverables.  Block 0 is due to be complete by August 15, 2003.  Block 1 is forecast to be complete in March 2004.  Block 0 appears to contain most of the DMAC functionality.  But, Block 1 contains "functionality improvements" which may or may not affect DMAC usage as a troubleshooting tool and affect its ability to interface to the VSCMT.  Respondents are requested to describe their capability to successfully accomplish this task within 18 months of contract award. The description should include current access to non-developmental items that will shorten the design and development time required.  Respondents should address their capability to acquire tactical SCS, DMAC and IETM data and demonstrate that the methods are workable and realistic.   Respondents should address their capability to develop trainer software concurrent with the development plan for the Tactical DMAC software.   Respondents should include any similar trainers developed and successfully completed in the last ten years. Include the trainer name; installation location by company/base, city, state, and POC; contract start and end dates; and whether any additional work was received from the same source. Respondents should indicate small (under 750 employees) or small/disadvantaged status.  This announcement is for market research purposes only. The Government does not intend to pay for information received. Submissions should be made in writing or via e-mail only.
