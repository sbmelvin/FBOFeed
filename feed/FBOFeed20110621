<p><br />SOLICITATION NUMBER: FA8601-11-R-0110<br /><br /><br /><br />This effort includes two projects: #1 (Project 090156) as the Base and #2 (Project 090187) as an Option. 1) Project 090156, Install HTHW Lines Area A Phase 1. Project scope includes the removal of abandoned underground steam &amp; condensate return lines, and the installation of new direct buried high temperature hot water (HTHW) lines from Facility 10271 to manhole S-57 and Facility 10286. 2) Project 090187, Install HTHW Lines Area A Phase 4. Project scope includes the removal of abandoned underground steam &amp; condensate return lines, and the installation of new direct buried high temperature hot water (HTHW) lines from manhole S-57 to the corner of Communication Blvd and Newark St. Install HTHW lateral to Bldgs 11403, 10293, 10295, and 10296. Installation of a new gas line to F/10879. The abandoned underground steam &amp; condensate return lines are assumed to contain asbestos containing insulating materials. The new HTHW lines will consist of both pre-engineered direct buried piping, and piping inside new &amp; existing concrete shallow trenches. Also included is the replacement of the steam heat exchangers with new HTHW to heating hot water heat exchangers, hot water pumps, and new DDC controls.<br /><br />Special requirements/concerns related to this project: <br />High Temperature Hot Water (HTHW) distribution systems require specialized construction skills and safety preparations. Standard facility construction experience is not sufficient. Construction timelines are very tight since these repairs cannot be started until after the HTHW system is turned off, and must be completed in time for activation in the fall for this critical utility system. Numerous facilities will not have heat until this project is completed. Work will need to be carefully coordinated with the Mechanical Shop to minimize impact to mission. Project also includes HVAC and asbestos work. <br /><br />The Air Force intends to award a contract with a 180 day period of performance.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>

The objective of the LCMR AN/TPQ-50 program is to provide continuous 360-degree surveillance to identify mortar locations, up to a range of ten kilometers (kms) with an accuracy of 50 meters (m) Circular Error Probability (CEP) and enable Warfighters to take timely action to neutralize identified threats from Rocket, Mortar and Artillery (RAM) attacks. The required items for this effort are up to 76 AN/TPQ-50 LCMR systems with vehicle mounts and AN/TPQ-50 initial spare parts to support those systems. The anticipated effort is intended to be a Firm-Fixed-Price effort. Currently the LCMR system is proprietary to SRCTec, Inc. and they are currently producing and sustaining all the variants in the fleet of LCMR systems.  <br><br>This purchase will be made under the authority of 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) authorized by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>Title: National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation Continuing Training and Materials Maintenance Project
<p>&nbsp;Background and Need</p>
<p>CDC currently funds approximately 240 community based organizations (CBOs) and health departments (HDs) to provide HIV prevention programs. The Program Evaluation Branch (PEB) within the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) has promoted the use of the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) variables for standardized data collection and reporting for national and local HIV prevention monitoring and evaluation. PEB has also provided an optional web-base software, the HIV Prevention Program Evaluation and Monitoring System (PEMS), to assist grantees. The collection and analysis of standardized HIV prevention evaluation data allows CDC to report on HIV prevention efforts at the national level. Funded agencies are required to report the NHM&amp;E required data and either use PEMS or other CDC-provided software for data submission to CDC or submit data compliant with NHM&amp;E requirements and formats to satisfy the terms of their cooperative agreements. PEB also promotes the use of data for monitoring and evaluation at the local level. The PEMS software provides functionality for grantees to track their program efforts and review their own data for program monitoring and improvement.</p>
<p>Three large-scale software training sessions consisting of 18 meetings, each a week long, to train about 15 people each week, were conducted after each of the first major releases of the PEMS software. One representative from participating health departments and community-based organizations received the software training and related materials in order to train their staff members. Each of the training sessions focused specifically on technical skills required to implement PEMS. In addition to software training activities, CDC conducted training on HIV prevention program data collection strategies and required variables.</p>
<p>A lesson learned from these experiences was that grantees need continuing, integrated training. The training should:<br />&#61607; focus on collecting and using the NHM&amp;E data,<br />&#61607; emphasize how required data can be used for program evaluation and monitoring activities, <br />&#61607; focus on activities necessary for using PEMS or other data collection software, <br />&#61607; assist grantees to improve program planning, management, and delivery of services.</p>
<p>Due to high turn-over rates among these organizations and agencies, many participating HDs and CBOs may currently have no staff trained in NHM&amp;E or to use PEMS software, contributing to great variation in the level of implementation of evaluation and use of the PEMS. Staff may also not have an understanding of CDC's data requirements and how data can be used for improving HIV prevention programs. Hence, CDC is currently in the process of developing NHM&amp;E training materials and presentations to cover a wide variety of needs. The goal is to develop web-based training materials that can be used by grantee staff on an as-needed, on-demand basis as self-paced learning, materials that can be used in webinars and other electronic training media, materials that can be used electronically or printed by grantees for their own use in conducting training for their own employees or contractors or as reference, and to develop and deliver training in a variety of settings (e.g., in-person, electronically, etc.). The task order to develop the initial set of materials and deliver these trainings ended December 31, 2009. A follow-on task order will end February 25, 2011. A four-month task order to keep work going through June 30, 2011 is in process. The proposed contract includes the development and completion of remaining training modules.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the NHM&amp;E requirements are evolving as the epidemic and program monitoring needs change, and since the PEMS software will also be modified or replaced to accommodate grantee requests, changes in requirements, and improvements in system function, there is also a need to continue developing the NHM&amp;E training and to maintain and improve the components of the training. This is the basis for this NHM&amp;E Continuing Training Development and Maintenance Project contract request.</p>

<DESC>THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTIFICATION IS FOR AN ACQUISITION SET ASIDE FOR 8(a) VENDORS ONLY. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.203(a), this synopsis provides at least 15 days notification that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation to obtain Provider Screening services. The requirement is set aside for offerors expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in SBA's 8(a) Program. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site in early July 2011.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS') Center for Program Integrity (CPI) is accountable for the prevention and detection of fraud, waste, abuse, and errors in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. CPI is implementing a National Fraud Prevention Program (NFPP) focused on prevention and detection that is integrated, risk-based, and measurable. The loss of taxpayer dollars through waste, fraud, and abuse drives up health care costs. CMS' program integrity mission also encompasses the operations and oversight necessary to ensure that CMS makes accurate payments to legitimate providers and suppliers for appropriate, reasonable, and necessary services and supplies for eligible Medicare beneficiaries. Reversing the traditional pay-and-chase approach to program integrity is the main goal of the National Fraud Prevention Program, a long-term, sustainable approach that incorporates innovative technologies in integrated solutions.</p>
<p>CMS is planning improvements to its provider screening process with several goals:<br />&bull; To compile provider-related data needed to support the NFPP <br />&bull; To comply with CMS additional screening requirements provisions of CFR 42 Parts 405, 424, 447, 455, 457 and 498 and DHHS Office of Inspector General Part CFR 42 Part 1007 <br />&bull; To automate provider/supplier screening procedures using consistent techniques<br />&bull; To automate assessment of risk pre-enrollment</p>
<p>CMS provider screening provisions affect all new applications and revalidations occurring after March 25, 2011 and require complete revalidation of all enrolled providers and suppliers in the Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program by March 23, 2013.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to obtain the following capabilities: 1) to perform automated screening on new and existing enrollments of providers/suppliers and 2) to conduct automated risk assessments for potential fraud, waste, and abuse on a pre- and post-enrollment basis, resulting in alerts and reporting to designated CMS business partners.</p>
<p><br />The Contractor solution must have the capability to:<br />&bull; Verify enrollment and re-enrollment data for all provider/suppliers and output results of data checks, <br />&bull; Output risk-based vulnerability assessment and deliver risk screening alerts whenever providers or suppliers fail to meet the requirements established by CMS, or where other data checks create a risk of potential fraud, <br />&bull; Provide a screening results interface to pass results of enrollment data and risk screening back to CMS and CMS business partners, and<br />&bull; Support new/updated sources of data to improve the accuracy of data checks/risk identification.</p>
<p><br />The verification and screening methods must be comprehensive, covering all Medicare provider/supplier categories and types, to include physicians and non-physician practitioners, and encompassing providers in all 50 states and 6 territories. The Contractor shall use both CMS data and appropriate external data sources to enhance risk screening. <br />By December 2011, the Contractor shall implement a comprehensive verification/screening and risk assessment solution, for all Medicare provider/supplier categories and types, to include physicians and non-physician practitioners, and encompassing providers in all states and territories. The provider screening solution must determine a risk score, identify and prioritize providers that are high risk of being potentially fraudulent based on screening criteria, and return mismatches between enrollment and external data sources, as well as supplementary data from external sources that is relevant to the risk assessment and appropriate feedback reports to designated CMS business partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) and deliverable schedule are attached for reference ONLY. The FINAL SOW and deliverable schedule will be issued with the solicitation.</p>
<p>CMS intends to award a hybrid Cost-Plus-fixed Fee/Fixed Price contract to a firm expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in SBA's 8(a) Program.</p>
<p>The period of performance is for a one (1) year base period, with four (4) one (1) year option periods to be exercised individually at the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available on the FBO website. It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded in late September 2011.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Aaron Blackshire, Contract Specialist, via email at aaron.blackshire@cms.hhs.gov, and Phyllis Lewis, Contracting Officer, via email at Phyllis.lewis@cms.hhs.gov.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (ED), Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development (OPEPD) anticipates the release of the subject solicitation on or about July 6, 2011. <br />
<p>Description<br /><br />The Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) requires customized technical assistance to improve the quality and reporting of outcomes and impact data from ED grant programs. ED intends to award a two year contract that will also include the option for an additional 24 months, which, if exercised, would allow the contractor to continue providing technical assistance to an additional cohort of ED programs.</p>
<p>Across ED, there is significant variation in the quality of information about program outcomes and impacts. Some programs have recently been evaluated or are currently being evaluated using a rigorous research methodology. Other Department programs collect correlational data or simple outcomes data from grantees that may be of uneven quality such that it is difficult to assess program performance. Some Department programs, often the smallest programs, currently have no information on program outcomes or impacts.<br /><br />The Government Performance Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) requires federal departments and agencies to clearly describe the goals and objectives of their programs, identify resources and actions needed to accomplish goals and objectives, develop a means of measuring progress made, and report regularly on achievement. The goals of the Act include: improving program effectiveness by promoting a focus on results, service quality, and customer satisfaction; improving congressional decision-making by providing objective information on achieving statutory objectives; and focusing on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of federal programs and spending. <br /><br />On January 4, 2011, President Obama signed into law the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010[1] (the Act), Public Law 111-352. The Act modernizes the Federal Government's performance management framework, retaining and amplifying aspects of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) while also addressing some of its weaknesses. In addition, the Act reinforces key elements of the Administration's approach to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of government: <br /><br />&bull; Leaders set clear, ambitious goals for a limited number of outcome-focused and management priorities; <br />&bull; Agencies measure, analyze, and communicate performance information to identify successful practices to spread and problematic practices to prevent or correct; and <br />&bull; Leaders frequently conduct in-depth performance reviews to drive progress on their priorities.</p>
<p><br />The Act emphasizes the use of goals and measures to improve outcomes, and requires the Federal Government to adopt a limited number of crosscutting goals, defined as objectives that cut across organizational (such as agency) boundaries. These goals are expected to focus on outcomes in a limited number of crosscutting policy areas, as well government-wide management objectives in the areas of financial management, human capital, procurement and acquisition, information technology, and real property. The Act also requires agencies to report performance against those goals through a single federal website at:</p>
<p>http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2011/m11-17.pdf</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br /><br />The overarching goal of the technical assistance contract is to promote and improve the quality of data on outcomes and impacts of Department grant programs. The technical support provided under this contract will provide data quality guidance to:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist program offices in the design and conduct of grant programs, so that successful applicants provide the Department with higher quality outcome and impact data. The contractor shall provide ED program office staff guidance on how the staff might structure their grant competitions to encourage grantees to plan for and collect quality impact or outcomes data and evaluations. The contactor shall also provide feedback to the program office on applicants' evaluation plans, to promote higher quality grantee evaluations and more accurate and meaningful data on program impacts/outcomes at the grantee level. The contractor shall also assist program offices in the design of reporting forms and OMB clearance packages.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide technical assistance to ED program grantees and/or their local evaluators that are collecting data on outcomes and impacts. The contractor shall provide assistance to grantees/local evaluators on the design, instrumentation, data collection, and analysis and reporting aspects of grantee-level evaluations in order to improve the quality of such evaluations. To accomplish this, the contractor shall develop and disseminate a series of evaluation guidance documents designed to educate and guide grantees on the conduct of their evaluations. In addition, the contractor shall conduct workshops on evaluation design, instrumentation, and data collection analyses at grantee meetings. Workshops shall focus on obtaining high quality outcomes data. The contractor shall also provide ongoing technical assistance to grantees/local evaluators through the review of key evaluation products and consultations regarding site-specific evaluations. The contractor shall develop guidance and assist grantees in identifying and collecting data that supports high-quality outcomes.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide data collection and analytical assistance to program offices with their annual performance data. The contractor shall assist program offices in the design of grantee reporting forms and the drafting of OMB clearance packages. The contractor shall provide guidance to program office staff as to how to obtain high quality data from their grantees and how to identify and address instances of data deficiencies (e.g. missing or inaccurate data). The contractor shall also provide analytic support to programs in interpreting and aggregating grantee-level data.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be twenty-four (24) months with one twenty-four month option period.</p>

<DESC>MSC will be issuing a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the following services:<br /><br />1. Background
<p>The Engineering Policy Branch (N732) of the Military Sealift Command (MSC) requires technical support in updating the Damage Control (DC) Documentation for the AS-40 USS FRANK CABLE. The AS-40 USS FRANK CABLE was turned over by the Navy to Military Sealift Command (MSC) to operate in 2008. At that time, the AS-40 USS FRANK CABLE had a Damage Control Book and Damage Control Diagrams in accordance with Naval Sea System Command Technical Specification (NTS) 9090-820A, last updated from PMA 2007. All valves, doors, hatches, scuttles, passageways, vestibules, manholes, etc., were labeled using Navy's DC conditions (X-ray, Yoke, Zebra, etc.). The accuracy of the existing DC Documentation and DC Label Plates&nbsp;is unknown. Subsequent to delivery to MSC, the AS-40 USS FRANK CABLE underwent structural modifications and equipment/system upgrades in Guam by Guam Shipyard and by Norfolk Naval Shipyard during the period 2008 to 2011. The modifications included habitability, fuel oil and ballast tank vent modifications, fire and smoke detection system installation, and ventilation (supply and exhaust) system changes. The DC Book, DC Diagrams, and DC Label Plates were not updated to reflect the modifications.<br /><br />Scope of Work</p>
<p>The scope of this task it to investigate the current physical configuration of the AS-40 USS FRANK CABLE and update the current, existing DC Book, DC Diagrams, DC Label Plates and other documentation listed in Section 3. The Contractor shall reclassify the valves, doors, hatches, scuttles, passageways, vestibules, manholes, etc., from the Navy's DC conditions (X-ray, Yoke, Zebra, etc.) to MSC classifications, Cruising (C) and Emergency (E). These valves, doors, hatches, scuttles, passageways, vestibules, manholes, etc. identified in the existing DC Documentation and NTS 9090-820A&nbsp;shall be re-labeled with MSC classification labels C or E. The Contractor shall produce and deliver to MSC the DC files and documentation listed herein. Likewise, the Contractor shall provide source files for all DC Documentation to MSC upon completion of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) in the format noted in Section 3. Detailed instructions on how to use and update the database shall be provided by the Contractor, along with producing a new linkable pdf file from the MS Access, MS Word, and MS Excel files for future changes.</p>
<p>2. Delivery Schedule<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Kick Off Meeting - Within ten (10) business days after acceptance of <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the order<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Preliminary DC Documents due - No later than Week Eight (8)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Final DC Documents, CD's and Source Files&nbsp;due - 30 November 2011<br /><br /><br />A firm fixed price Contract with reimbursable travel will be issued resultant of this RFQ.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with National Instruments Corporation of Austin, Texas for the purchase of a Programmable Robot Safety System under other than full and open competition.<br /><br />NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
<p>(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in -</p>
<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)<br /><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The National Instruments Corporation programmable robot safety system will be used in conjunction with an existing robot test bed already owned by NIST. In order to ensure compatibility, the system must be 100% compatible with the existing National Instruments Labview software currently used at NIST. Deviations away from the National Instruments programmable robot safety system would cause needless replication of key equipment, compatibility issues and would result in significant duplication of cost to NIST in both hardware and man-hours. National Instruments Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this system. As a result, National Instruments Corporation is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334119, and the size standard is 1000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on July 5, 2011. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joshua.holliday@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC><p><br />The purpose of this contract is to support the National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Reagent Program (ARP) in achieving its goal of providing critical research reagents and resources to the scientific community. An important rate-limiting step in basic research is the identification and distribution of state-of-the-art reagents and technology. To address this need, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) supports the ARP as a contract. Since its establishment in 1988, the ARP has evolved from a small bank of research materials to a unique and versatile worldwide resource, offering over 8,600 critical reagents not otherwise readily available to the HIV/AIDS research community. The ARP acquires, develops, and produces state-of-the-art reagents and provides these reagents at no cost to over 3,000 qualified investigators located in 79 countries throughout the world. Additionally, the ARP serves as an important resource for information about AIDS-related reagents and disseminates this information through its comprehensive website (http://www.aidsreagent.org).</p>
<p>To fulfill the technical requirements, the Contractor shall support the identification, acquisition, production, maintenance, characterization and distribution of state of the art reagents to the AIDS research community of investigators with the purpose of advancing AIDS research. Furthermore, the contract provides support for quality control and characterization of reagents, technology transfer, and execution of material transfer agreements prior to release of reagents to the community.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, term type contract will be awarded for a 1-year Base period plus six 1-year options for a possible total period of performance of 7 years beginning on or about June 29, 2012. The performance requirement will be for the delivery of 10.21full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the base period (Year 1) and option periods (Years 2 through 7), which may be unilaterally exercised by the Government. In addition to the services outlined above to be provided in the base requirement, for additional services under the contract may be exercised at the discretion of the Government to provide an increased level of effort to meet unanticipated needs for acquiring reagents, assays, or technologies. Should the Government elect to exercise the increased level of effort options, the Contractor shall provide resources for the unanticipated increase in work volume in an amount of 1.0 FTE that may be exercised up to twice per performance year.</p>

<DESC>This acquisition is for determining the viability to mechanically remove the Internal Cushioning Pad and Seals for the Tomahawk Block IV Composite Capsule Launching System (CCLS) MK 45 Tube Assembly. Naval Air Systems Command intends to procure this sole source from Raytheon Missile Systems, 1151 East Hermans Road, Tucson, Arizona. Raytheon is the sole source manufacturer of the Tomahawk Missile System and the only known source with the requisite knowledge of the Tomahawk Blk IV AUR.
<p>The tasks to be completed under Phase I are for the development of a machine and process to mechanically remove the internal cushioning pads and seals from the MK 45 Composite Capsule Launching System (CCLS) tube assembly. Phase I will evaluate commercially available technologies for implementation in a pad removal machine that will enable a reduced remanufacturing cost for the MK 45 tube assembly. The tasks completed under this SOW shall conform to the approved Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) data requirements and support review by the CRI Affordability and CRI Executive Affordability Boards. The Contractor shall conduct industrial capabilities research in order to determine a viable approach towards implementing into the MK 45 remanufacturing process, a pad and seal removal machine. This task may include sending samples of sections from scrapped Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) capsule barrels to potential companies, conduct company visits, and conduct proof of concept testing at companies. The Contractor shall develop concepts for method(s) of removing the pads and seals from the MK 45 barrel, and conduct testing upon technologies in order to determine the viability to remove the pads while not damaging the MK 45 barrel. The Contractor shall evaluate all proven concepts to determine the best solution, and develop a conceptual design of the chosen concept for further evaluation under a future Phase II program.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center â€“ Panama City, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Spencer Industries, Inc, 80 Holmes St, Belleville, NJ 07109 on a sole source, firm-fixed price basis for the acquisition of for one hundred five (105) Chain Cargo Lashing (NSN 3990-01-506-9254) with all component parts coated with ArmorGalv per ASTM A 1059/A 1059M-08.  This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reason.  The NAVSEA LCAC Program Office has tasked NSWC-PCD with procuring two ship sets of legacy LCAC cargo lashing (105 total) â€“ NSN 3990-01-506-9254 coated with ArmorGalv for further evaluation on two LCACs during upcoming deployments.  During this period, the cargo lashings will be subjected to repeated use and exposed to the elements to determine the overall effectiveness of the ArmorGalv coating under real world conditions.
  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Science and Technology (S&T) Project on automated cargo lashings testing was completed on an LCAC at NSWC-PCD in June 2010.  During this testing several different types of cargo lashings were evaluated and pull-tested.  One successful aspect of this effort was the testing of legacy 35,000 pound rated LCAC cargo lasing with ArmorGalv corrosion proof coating applied.  In addition, a six month evaluation of the ArmorGalv coated cargo lashings was completed during the period of July â€“ December 2010, as well as a continuing evaluation.  ArmorGalv is a corrosion proof coating applied to the steel parts per a Zinc-Alloy Thermo-Diffusion Coating (TDC) in accordance with ASTM A 1059/A 1059M-08.
  As noted, NSWC-PCD has already successfully pull tested Spencer Industries ArmorGalv coated LCAC cargo lashing to 35,000 pounds (six lashings), validating the required strength to adequately restrain USMC vehicles on the LCAC cargo deck.  Spencer Industries, Inc., is the only manufacturer who currently has the expertise to manufacture LCAC cargo lashings using all component parts coated with ArmorGalv per ASTM-A1059.  Anticipated award date will be on or about 30 July 2011.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.
 Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The basis for award will be upon fair and reasonable pricing.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Generally, the project will consist of connecting a 36" pipe (variable materials) to the existing bypass system line and extending it approximately 2100' downstream and 500' into the river.  There are several connections and rerouting required.  A good portion of the pipe will be buried HDPE, but some portion will be supported steel pipe over ground and over water.  Specifically, work consists of replacing or extending the following; a primary 36 inch pipe for fish by-passed around the Juvenile Fish Facility (JFF), a 12 inch pipe connection to the 36 inch primary line for fish routed through the facility and released back to the river, a 16 inch adult line connection to the 36 inch primary line at the facility, and a 24 inch supply line connection, again to the 36 inch primary pipe, near the facility. <br><br>Structural support of the pipe system includes the following:<br>1.	Support approximately 200 feet at an average elevation of approximately 15 feet above grade of the 36 inch primary diversion steel pipe filled with water for fish transport.  These supports will be a combination of some new steel structures and some existing structure.  Steel supports for the 36 inch line will occur at approximately 50 feet on center.  The supports will be founded on concrete footings.  Shallow excavations will be required to set the concrete footings.  <br>2.	The Steel pipe will transition to buried HDPE.  Support of a 36 inch diameter HDPE pipe for a distance of approximately 2400 feet by burial at a base of pipe elevation averaging 8 feet below grade.  In some instances the pipe is at 0 ft deep and will require earthen berms.  Excavation, backfill, compaction, grade preparation and laying of the pipe will meet Corps criteria and specifications.  <br>3.	The Primary line will transition back to a 36" steel pipe, turn 90 degrees and route toward the river.  Support of the 36" inch diameter steel pipe will be approximately 500 feet over water on steel supports. The steel supports will consist of single, cased, reinforced concrete shafts - spaced approximately 50 - 55 feet on center.   Each shaft will be on average 80' long and extend to bedrock.  Initially, the 48 inch diameter steel casings will be drilled through a silt layer and driven to a depth of ten feet into the bedrock.  Drilling will proceed approximately ten feet beyond the base of the casing.  A rebar cage will be placed down into the casing.  Tremie concrete will be placed into the casing from the base of the hole drilled into the bedrock continuing all the way up, filling the voids within the rebar cage and between the cage and the wall of the casing.<br>4.	In addition to the Primary 36 inch line the work will require supports for 520 feet of a 12-inch pvc pipe connection to the 36 inch primary line for fish routed through the facility and released back to the river.  Steel supports for the 12 inch line will occur at approximately 50 feet on center.  The supports will be founded on concrete footings.  Shallow excavations will be required to set the concrete footings. <br>5.	An existing 14 inch adult fish line at the facility will be replaced with a 16 inch adult fish line and will require no additional supports<br>6.	Finally, approximately 200 feet of a 24-inch supply line will be rerouted and connected to the 36 inch primary outfall.   Steel supports for the 24 inch line will occur at approximately 50 feet on center.  The supports will be founded on concrete footings.  Shallow excavations will be required to set the concrete footings.<br><br>General:  <br>1.	The total length of pipe is approximately 3100 feet.   The pipe must closely follow a defined slope and horizontal alignment from the tie-in points at the Juvenile Fish Facility to the outfall point some 500 feet from shore.<br>2.	All pipes supported above grade will have ring girder type saddle supports.  Expansion joints will be provided in the piping and thermal forces will be accommodated in the structures. <br>3.	All structural steel will meet Corps criteria and AISC guidelines, specifications and standard practices.  Shop drawings will be required.<br>4.	All concrete work will meet Corps criteria and ACI guidelines, specifications and standard practices.  Reinforcing shop drawings will be required.<br>5.	All welding shall be done by certified welders meeting AWS D1.1 and Corps criteria.  <br>6.	All piling will meet Corps criteria and specifications.<br>7.	Location of all existing structures and utilities which may be affected by the work will be verified by the contractor.  All known information on these items will be supplied by the Corps.<br>8.	Existing sod and irrigation lines impacted by pipeline installation will be repaired to restore Lower Monumental Dam Park area to conditions similar to pre-construction conditions.<br>9.	The construction period is anticipated to begin in October 2011.  The contract will contain strict schedule requirements to complete the work by March 2012. Work conditions include elevated work and work over water.  Work will probably also require support of a barge-mounted crane.  Contractor must have a past performance history of work similar to the work required.<br>10.	Contractor is required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at  http://www.usace.army.mil/CESO/Documents/EM385-1-1FINAL.pdf  <br><br>Solicitation No. W912EF-11-R-0024 will be posted to the FBO website on or about July 8, 2011.

<DESC><br />Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (SRNS), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS) for the Department of Energy, solicits expressions of interest from companies wishing to license or enter into a Funds-In Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to further develop the In-Situ Production of Microbial Pigments for Metal and Actinide Immobilization. Researchers at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) have developed a new method of rapidly immobilizing metal and radionuclide contaminants in soil over the long term without the need for excavation. Using the method of In-Situ Production of Microbial Pigments for Metal and Actinide Immobilization the ground is treated to stimulate growth of the soil's native bacteria. A polymer is also produced which promotes the immobilization of various hazardous contaminants. Tests using surfacial treatments have indicated significant decreases in the mobilization of contaminants within a one month period. Because the In-Situ Production of Microbial Pigments for Metal and Actinide Immobilization is a completely in-situ method it results in minimal disruption to both the immediate area and neighboring environment which translates into reduced costs. Any company interested in licensing this device or participating in a Funds-In CRADA must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later that 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity. Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology. Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to the Point of Contact identified in this Notice. This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in Licensing this invention or participating in a Funds-In CRADA only.<br />

<CONTACT>Leisa A. Zemba, Contract Specialist, Phone 3218540974, Email leisa.zemba@patrick.af.mil - Gregory Harris, Contracting Officer, Phone 3218530970, Email gregory.harris@patrick.af.mil
<DESC>The Patrick Air Force Base 45th Contracting Squadron is seeking sources with the capability to fill the requirement for the 45th Weather Squadron (45 WS) to update the current lightning probability tool used by the 45 WS for their daily planning forecasts. There are two main goals to be fulfilled in the update of the lightning probability tool: 1) extend the tool to include Oct, and 2) determine if stratifying the predictive equations by variable lightning sub-seasons improves performance as compared to the monthly stratifications currently being used and implement the updated tool into 45 WS operations accordingly. Extend the period the tool runs to include 1 May-31 Oct (currently the tool only runs 1 May-30 Sep). Stratify the tool by lightning sub-season, rather than by month. The dates of the lightning sub-seasons vary year to year, which must be considered in developing the updated tool. If that doesn't out-perform the current monthly stratifications, update the tool to using monthly stratifications to include Oct (May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct). Extend the study to include the most recent lightning seasons. Optimize the tool's performance on dependent data and verify its performance on independent data. Document the performance of the tool. Implement operationally on the Meteorological Information Data Display System (MIDDS) used by 45 WS. Attached documents describe the current 45 WS lightning probability tool and the MIDDS system. The following steps are the 45 WS suggested approach to the achievement of the above stated goals, though an alternate contractor approach may be considered at such time if an RFP is issued:
<p>1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Step</span>: Develop an algorithm to identify the lightning sub-season objectively. The five lightning sub-seasons are: 1) pre-season, 2) ramp-up, 3) mid-season, 4) ramp-down, and 5) post-season. There is also a sixth &lsquo;out-of-season' sub-season from 1 Jan thru 30 Apr/1 Nov thru 31 Dec; however, this sub-season doesn't apply to this task, as the tool only runs 1 May thru 31 Oct. Refer to the attached description of the current tool for the lightning sub-seasons. <br />Note: One approach for the algorithm to identify the lightning sub-seasons objectively for each year is to use the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) daily flash count across central Florida, correlate with known dates, and check if the NLDN's climatology agrees with the accepted dates. The sub-seasons must occur sequentially. Once a sub-season begins within a certain season, do not revert back to a previous sub-season, i.e. once the sub-season begins, subsequent days must either be that season, or the next season in sequence. For example, if the mid-season has begun in a certain summer, do not fall-back to the ramp-up season or pre-season.</p>
<p>2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Step</span>: Develop logistic regression equations stratified by lightning sub-season to predict the probability of lightning for each day. Select optimum predictor variables based on sub-season, repeating the process used in developing the current tool. If the new equations do not outperform the current tool, update the tool using monthly stratification to include Oct. Confer with the 45 WS on the decision of which version of the update to implement. Use all years, including new seasons, since last version of the tool was developed. Optimize the coefficients of the logistic regression on training data. Test on random independent verification data set where the data are selected randomly across all days, i.e. entire seasons are not selected randomly.</p>
<p>3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Step</span>: Document performance of the updated tool on independent data. Provide both absolute performance metrics to include probability of detection, probability of false alarm, true skill score, attribute/reliability diagram, sharpness diagrams, and briar skill score. Also document performance of the new tool relative to the current tool. Use same period of record for the comparison. This may have been done under the second goal.</p>
<p>4) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fourth Step</span>: Implement updated tool in MIDDS. Assistance from Eastern Range personnel may be required.</p>
<p>5) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fifth Step</span>: Provide training to 45 WS on how to use the tool on MIDDS and summarizing the development and performance of the new tool.</p>
<p>7) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sixth Step</span>: Provide final report documenting the development of the updated tool and its performance.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intention to set aside this requirement under a small business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 541990. The size standard for NAICS 541990 is $7M. The Government is interested in all qualified and experienced small businesses, including 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses that, in the Government's opinion, are capable of performing this requirement. In the event that no qualified and experienced small business responds, it will be the Government's intention to consider all other sources. The Government requests that interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), business status (i.e., 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, small business), and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision.</p>
<p>Sources should submit a brief capabilities statement in response to this notice. The response should be no more than 3 typed pages and must address the following areas: 1) provide a description of the firm's background in meteorology and general statistics, 2) demonstrate past performance in creating lightning probability forecast tools, preferably for the CCAFS/KSC local area 3) demonstrate experience developing and implementing software tools for MIDDS 4) demonstrate experience using statistical analysis techniques working with lightning probability tools, particularly logistic regression, to include optimum selection of predictor variables, and experience using statistical analysis software to perform those statistical techniques, and 5) demonstrate knowledge of local weather influences for the CCAFS/KSC and Central Florida. Submit capabilities statement to: Attn: Leisa Zemba, Bldg 1704, Hangar Rd, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL 32920-2200 or email to leisa.zemba@patrick.af.mil. Responses are due no later than 30 June 2010. Direct all questions to the attention of Leisa Zemba at 321 854-0974.</p>
<p>This sources sought is NOT a Request For Proposal (RFP) and does NOT commit the Government to pay for information requested, issuance of a solicitation, or award of a contract. This effort is considered Commercial in nature and any resultant RFP/Contract will be issued/awarded IAW FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) requests information on existing full vehicle blast mitigation capabilities currently available to protect Light Tactical Vehicle occupants from Objective (O) M-ATV* level underbody threats. The most important technical considerations will focus on existing full vehicle level blast mitigating systems (as opposed to individual systems), which may include but are not limited to, underbody shaping, cab stiffness, energy absorbing interior crew floor, blast mitigating seats, and any other existing mitigating technologies. This RFI is exclusively interested in existing full vehicle designs that are available to start comparative testing by 25 July 2011. The government intends to enter into multiple appropriate Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to quantify the effectiveness of existing vehicle level blast mitigation strategies and for compilation of data and comparison of approaches. Blast mitigation strategies submitted will be compared with respect to the level of mitigation of occupant injuries as rated against the Head Injury Criteria (HIC), Dynamic Response Index (DRI), Revised Tibia Index (RTI), and blunt trauma injury criteria. The overall program objective is to gain knowledge for comparative analysis of blast injury mitigation for vehicle level strategies, for potential consideration in current and future programs. <br><br>*As Amended

Notice Number: 19065
Key Dates:Issue Date: 6/21/11Response Due Date: 6/24/11 by 2:00 pm Eastern Standard TimePlease ensure your e-mail response has "RFI #19065" in the subject line.
Issued by:The Department of Interior (DOI) National Business Center (NBC) Acquisition Service Directorate (AQD) in Herndon VA is issuing the subject Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), National Institute of Health's (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). AQD is a federal franchise fund contracting office within DOI under the authority of the Government Management Reform Act (GMRA) and is authorized to provide acquisition support to all federal and DoD agencies.  
RFI Objective:
The Government is seeking market research, sources sought, and general industry information to help aid in finalizing a statement of work or objectives requirements document which will be included in an upcoming solicitation.  The projected RFQ/RFP will request proposals to provide access to and use of fiber optic infrastructure  to give NIAID's Hamilton, Montana facility exclusive use, management, control, and configuration of a 10 Gigabit or greater end user connection to the NIAID network, operated in accord with regional providers and Internet2.  The future analysis requirement may be advertised and posted to the Federal Business Opportunities web site at FedBizOpps.gov (FBO.gov).
The Government is asking for interested qualified firms to review this notice and respond as stated under the "How to Respond" section of this document.
Background:The NIAID pursues research in two basic ways; through intramural research performed by laboratories headed by federal employees who work for the Institute, and through extramural research, for which NIAID awards grants and contracts to outside institutions to help them pay for their research efforts.  The Division of Intramural Research (DIR) conducts basic and clinical research in a wide range of disciplines related to immunology, allergy, and infectious diseases.  A key component of DIR is the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), NIH's state-of-the-art biomedical research facility located in Hamilton, MT. In addition to five research labs and the newly constructed Integrated Research Facility (IRF), resources on the RML campus include state-of-the-art technologies for use by NIAID researchers in Hamilton, MT, as well as Bethesda, MD. For example, the Genomics Unit within RML's Research Technologies Section (RTS), has recently invested in advanced gene sequencing technologies to meet investigators' standard and custom DNA sequencing needs.   Over 80 percent of NIAID's budget supports extramural investigators at universities, hospitals and medical research institutes throughout the U.S. and abroad. Additionally, the Institute has long realized that health is a global challenge requiring effective collaboration with a global research community of governments, health providers, academia and industry. Given the geographical dispersion of its extramural partners, NIAID is constantly seeking ever more effective and efficient means to collaborate with that extended community.  One collaborative strategy that NIH has invested in is participation in the Internet2 organization and access to its nation-wide advanced optical and packet network. Internet2 is a not-for-profit advanced networking consortium comprising more than 200 U.S. universities in cooperation with 70 leading corporations, 45 government agencies, laboratories and other institutions of higher learning as well as over 50 international partner organizations.  The Internet2 network is a high speed network that provides the necessary scalability for member institutions to efficiently provision resources and address bandwidth-intensive requirements such as, collaborative applications, distributed research experiments, grid-based data analysis and professional networking.  The Internet2 network currently provides, ten 10 Gbps links on each segment of the network, but is testing new 40 and 100 Gbps technologies.  The security and speed of the Internet2 network provides NIH researchers in labs located in Maryland the ability to interact with external collaborators using instant meetings, "telepresence" video conferencing, and common file repositories. Large data sets and files (gigabytes to terabytes) can be stored in one place, readily accessed in another, and automatically replicated to a third for off-site back-up.  The RML constitutes a critical research asset to the whole of NIAID's research community, intramural as well extramural partners. Access by DIR's intramural researchers in Bethesda, Maryland to the  state-of-the-art technologies maintained at the RML, as well as the global research community's ability to effectively collaborate with RML researchers are vital to accomplishing the Institute's overall mission. However, due to limitations in the intervening telecom infrastructure, the RML campus does not have access to the Internet2 network, but rather is connected to the NIAID Maryland labs and external collaborators via a Digital Signal 3 (DS3) telecom line. A DS3, also referred to as a T3 line, is a digital signal level 3 T-carrier with a signal performance capacity limited to approximately 45 Mbit/s.  By way of comparison, the Internet2 network's performance is at least 200 times greater and will shortly be over 1,000 times that of RML's current data transfer capability.  
Until recently, the telecom transport capacity at the RML campus was sufficient for the need, however, the combination of the recent construction of an advanced IRF and the deployment of advanced, data-intensive research tools like RTS' gene sequencer have increased the demand on the RML infrastructure by an order of magnitude.  For example, the results of a single experiment performed on behalf of DIR researchers in Maryland using the gene sequencer may result in hundreds of gigabytes, if not terabytes, of data. That data must be transferred back to the DIR labs in Maryland in order for scientists to mine the data for useful research information.  Given the fact that up to 50% of the current throughput capability of RML's commercial DS3 telecom line is already consumed by the normal network traffic of RML staff, RML's current network capacity is no longer sufficient to meet its requirements.  
OCICB recently engaged an independent consultant with extensive knowledge of the regional telecommunications community, both public and private, in the Montana region to assess alternatives available to NIAID to affect the desired connectivity.  That consultant found that, although there exists commercially available dark fiber between Missoula, MT and both Chicago and Seattle, similar capacity does not exist between the RML campus in Hamilton and Missoula, a distance of approximately 45 miles. In order to effectively link the RML with the broader Internet2 network, NIAID must either find a commercial service provider willing to invest in the fiber optic infrastructure not yet available between Missoula and Hamilton, or fund the construction itself.  
Purpose and Requirement Information:
NIAID seeks access to and use of fiber optic infrastructure to give RML exclusive use, management, control, and configuration of a 10 Gigabit or greater end user connection to the NIAID network, operated in accord with regional providers and Internet2. The physical infrastructure will address at least the following elements:
1.	Link the RML site in Hamilton, Montana, to a common network junction point in Missoula, Montana.
2.	Extend from the Missoula junction point to an appropriate Internet2 connection point operated by Internet2 in Seattle, Washington and Chicago, Illinois.
3.	Optionally, NIAID may wish to establish a direct connection from RML to an Internet2 connection point in Salt Lake City, Utah.The multiple routes from Hamilton to Internet2 connection points is required to provide for adequate fault tolerance across the resulting network.  
NIAID envisions a two-phase project to establish the desired 10Gbps network connection between NIAID's RML campus in Hamilton, Montana and Internet2 network connection points in Seattle, Washington, Chicago, Illinois, and optionally in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Phase I will consist of the construction of the physical fiber optic infrastructure between RML and Missoula followed by the maintenance of the physical infrastructure then establish wave service between RML and the Internet2 network in Chicago and Seattle. Phase II (optional) will acquire and or construct the physical fiber optic infrastructure between RML and the Internet2 point of presence in Salt Lake City, Utah and then establish wave service between RML and the Internet2 network. The contractor shall perform the following specific tasks:

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for the separation and analysis of manufactured nanomaterials in environmental samples.  The National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) of the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) is developing methodologies to assess occurrence data.  Occurrence data is necessary for developing risk assessments whereby risk from a particular exposure is considered and estimated as to its impact on ecosystems and ultimately human health.  As a part of this effort, the Environmental Sciences Division-Environmental Chemistry Branch (ESD-ECB) of NERL is developing specific approaches to develop standardized methods where analytical gaps are identified for nanomaterials, especially the most commercially used nano-silver.  The main goal of this research project is the separation and characterization of the manufactured nano-silver from complex environmental media and from naturally occurring nanoparticles that ma y be present and cause interferences, e.g. SiO2, Fe2O3, or TiO2.
This action is being pursued on a sole source basis for the following reason.  Construction, testing, and, if required, modification of a spinning disc apparatus that is capable of the separation of silver nanoparticles from environmental media is a unique capability existing at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). 
 UNLV has considerable expertise in using selective surface sorption to separate particles. Separation from environmental matrices is critical for this effort so as to provide analyses of manufactured and engineered nano-silver.  In order to trace and verify that separation is achieved, the separation studies will include the use of radioactive gamma ray emitting silver atoms created by neutron capture and determined by a gamma ray detector. This operation takes advantage of a unique combination of separation capabilities, combined with use of radioactive tracers present at UNLV.  The nanoparticle nature of the separated silver particles will be verified by use of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) or a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to measure the silver nanoparticle dimensions.  Once a successful separation technique is proven, it shall be applied to environmental matrices selected from surfaces, ground water, wastewater, plants, fish tissues, biosolids, sediments, and soils.
To the best of our knowledge this combination of required expertise appears to be unique to UNLV, especially the use of the spinning disc apparatus, which may have the surface of the disc modified by adding surface coatings, combined with the use of the radiolabeled silver tracer.
NAICS Code 541620 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to demonstrate the aforementioned capabilities  and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC><p>Information Technology Portfolio Management Support Services</p>
<p>The Office of Justice Programs is seeking sources capable of providing support of its Portfolio Management Program. Vendors communicating experience providing all OJP Portfolio Management functions (IT Investment Management, IT Project Management, Financial Management and Enterprise Architecture) and further communicating an ability to integrate these functions into a unified program will be provided a Request for Proposal (RFP). Responses shall be limited to three (3) pages, single sided, 12 point font with one (1) inch borders.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) provides innovative leadership to federal, state, local, and tribal justice systems, by disseminating state-of-the art knowledge and practices across America, and providing grants for the implementation of these crime fighting strategies. Because most of the responsibility for crime control and prevention falls to law enforcement officers in states, cities, and neighborhoods, the federal government can be effective in these areas only to the extent that it can enter into partnerships with these officers. Therefore, OJP does not directly carry out law enforcement and justice activities. Instead, OJP works in partnership with the justice community by developing outreach initiatives and programs to identify the most pressing crime-related challenges confronting the justice system and to provide information, training, coordination, and innovative strategies and approaches for addressing these challenges.<br />The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides leadership and guidance in Information Technology (IT) for all of OJP. The OCIO manages IT products, services, and resources to advance OJP's mission, as well as to improve management effectiveness to deliver superior results to OJP's employees and U.S. citizens by maximizing the benefits of information technology. This Statement of Work describes the scope of work, objectives, tasks, and resources needed to successfully fulfill OCIO's IT Portfolio Management related responsibilities in support of OJP's mission.</p>
<p>Requirement<br />The contractor shall provide support services and Program Management to manage and administer OCIO IT Portfolio Management functions of: Project Management, Financial Management, Investment Management, and Enterprise Architecture. The broad scope of work consists of consulting, planning, researching, analyzing, assessing, reviewing, and integrating processes and procedures; tracking, monitoring and controlling resources; and developing briefings, whitepapers, reports, policies, and tools to manage and administer OJP's IT portfolio.</p>
<p>Program Management (PgM) <br />The Program Management task includes the activities necessary for the contractor to manage his or her personnel on the resultant contract as well as coordinate contract activities with the government. The contractor shall provide Program Management to administer, manage, and oversee the integration of OCIO's Portfolio Management support activities, including but not limited to Project Management, Financial Management, Investment Management, and Enterprise Architecture.</p>
<p>IT Investment Management Support<br />The contractor shall provide investment management support by performing the following activities under this task, which include but are not limited to: Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process in satisfying the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) preparation, submission and execution of the budget (OMB-A-11) requirements for Information Technology, e-Government, and capital assets management. IT Investment Reporting and maintenance of Exhibit 300 information for investments determined to be major.</p>
<p>IT Project Management (PM) Support<br />The contractor shall assist federal employee project managers with all aspects of the project lifecycle including planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and close out. The project management support team shall provide a significant level of competence to any technology project they undertake by leveraging technical backgrounds with strong IT management experience, and providing clear communication among different disciplines to deliver to current-year and future-year initiatives that cross platforms, applications, and/or business lines.</p>
<p>Financial Management Support<br />The contractor shall provide Financial Management Support to administer and manage OCIO's Budget. The contractor shall perform day-to-day financial management activities including, but not limited to, developing, updating, tracking, and reporting allocated, obligated, capitalized, and expensed funds, as well as conduct analyses to provide financial recommendations.<br />Enterprise Architecture (EA) Support<br />The OJP Enterprise Architecture will be developed in a phased approach, leveraging the Department's segment architecture methodology. Architecture Management will be a steady-state activity to ensure participation, education, communication, monitoring and control as described in the SOW EA task. All EA models and standards will be updated as appropriate to include information from each segment initiated.</p>
<p>*Contractors interested in competing for this requirement MUST respond to this notice (expressing interest) by the end date and time in order to be considered.</p>
<p>**Contractors that respond will be issued the full SOW and required to submit a capability statement in response to the SOW. OJP will then review these capability statements and make a down-select from the contractor pool based on the contractors whose capability statements best address our requirements document (SOW). The selected contractors will then be issued the RFP and invited to compete for this contract.</p>
<p>***This requirement is a competitive 8(a) requirement. Eligibility will be verified, please submit your 8(a) information with your interest statement.</p>
<p>****All eligible contractors must be able to perform these services in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>*****All response shall be submitted to Elvis R. Colbert, via email at Elvis.Colbert@usdoj.gov no later than 3:00pm on Thursday June 23, 2010. Please note that no telephone calls will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Authority
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Office of Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services/ Epidemiology and Analysis Program Office issues this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) under the provisions of FAR 35.016 and FAR 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Contracts that are awarded based on responses to this BAA are as a result of full and open competition and therefore in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."</p>
<p>The CDC may award contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, not for profit organizations, state and local government, and private industry for research and development (R&amp;D) in those areas covered in Part II of this BAA.</p>
<p>Process</p>
<p>Funding of research within CDC will be determined by funding constraints and research priorities set during each budget cycle. Therefore, those contemplating submission of a white paper are encouraged to contact the CDC BAA Technical Coordinator or the technical point of contact as noted below to determine whether the research warrants further inquiry. If the research warrants further inquiry and if funding is available, then submission of a white paper/proposal will be entertained.</p>
<p>The following four-step sequence is established for offerors contemplating submission of a proposal under this BAA. This sequence allows for an early determination of the potential for interest based on technical merit, applicability to CDC and projected funding. This process is designed to limit offeror and Government expenditure of effort to prepare and review formal proposals for research that may have little chance of being supported.</p>
<p>Step 1 - Telephone Contact (Technical Dialogue)</p>
<p>This step initiates a technical dialogue between the Government and the potential offeror. The initial point of contact may direct callers to a specific scientific/technical point of contact based on the topic area and specifics of the proposed research project. The initial contact points for each area of research interest identified in Part II are shown below:</p>
<p>Research Area Technical Points of Contact Phone Number<br />Updating Community Guide Reviews on the Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve Oral Health Randy Elder, June 29 - July 5, 2011<br />Theresa Sipe, June 21-28, 2011 404-498-0953<br />404-498-0980</p>
<p>Step 2 - Submission of Informal White Paper (Technical Dialogue)</p>
<p>This step is a continuation of the technical dialogue for projects of interest. The scientific point of contact may request submission of an informal white paper no more than 4 pages in length (exclusive of resumes and appendices) to facilitate their understanding of the scientific and technical aspects of the proposed research project. Use of the white paper is intended to determine which efforts are of sufficient scientific and technical merit prior to submission of a formal research proposal as described in Part IV; therefore, informal white papers should not be as lengthy or detailed as a formal proposal (see Part IV). Informal white papers should contain a Rough Order of Magnitude estimate (Estimated Cost).</p>
<p>All submitted papers will undergo an initial review for technical merit and program applicability. The technical review team may discuss the proposed project with the potential offeror, as required, to facilitate the Government's understanding of the scientific and technical aspects of the proposed research project.</p>
<p>Step 3 - Submission of Formal Research Proposal</p>
<p>This step ends the technical dialog. If there is sufficient interest in a proposed research project, the Contracting Officer will invite the offeror to submit a formal research proposal (see Part IV). Once the Contracting Office receives a research proposal, communication between scientific personnel and the offeror is permitted only as authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Please note that the Government may use non-Government participants during the evaluation of the proposals technical section (See Part III - Use of Non-Government Personnel).</p>
<p>Step 4 - Contract Award for Selected Projects</p>
<p>All proposals will receive an initial review (see Part V) and the Contracting Officer will notify the offeror, in writing, whether the proposal will be processed for award. The primary basis for selecting proposals for award shall be public health importance, scientific/technical merit, and prior experience and capacity. Cost realism, reasonableness and fund availability will also be considered to the extent appropriate. See Part V for specific evaluation criteria. The Government has the right to make multiple awards.</p>
<p>Government obligation</p>
<p>Persons submitting white papers and proposals are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds. The Government is under no obligation to pay for the cost of a white paper or proposal. There is no commitment on behalf of the Government to fund any proposal. Contractors are cautioned that the submission of a white paper and a proposal is submitted strictly on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>Updating Community Guide Reviews on the Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve Oral Health</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Through the FY 2011 Prevention and Public Health Fund, CDC plans to fund research in the area of public health services and systems. Per the legislation, specific requirements for research to be supported within this initiative are to:</p>
<p>&bull; Examine evidence-based practices related to prevention, with a particular focus on high priority areas consistent with the National Prevention Strategy and Healthy People 2020, including comparisons of community-based public health interventions in terms of effectiveness and cost;<br />&bull; Analyze the effective translation of interventions from academic settings to real world settings; and<br />&bull; Identify effective strategies to organize, finance or deliver public health services in real world community settings, including comparisons of State and local health department structures and systems in terms of effectiveness and cost.<br />In order to fulfill the intent of the legislation, CDC invites the submission of innovative public health research projects that align with the requirements stated above. The CDC intends to support research that has the potential to yield high impact public health results. High impact public health refers to the measured effect that an activity or intervention has on reducing the public health burden of a prevalent, costly disease or condition and has the potential to improve population health on a large scale.<br /><br />For this announcement, CDC is requesting white papers for the following topic area, which is further described further below:</p>
<p>Updating Community Guide Reviews on the Effectiveness of Interventions to Improve Oral Health</p>
<p><br />Practitioners, policymakers, and others are increasingly expected to use evidence-based approaches when making decisions about which public health initiatives to support with their limited resources. The Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide) is internationally respected as an invaluable aid to such decision making. Using state-of-the-art scientific methods, the Community Guide engages with CDC and other federal and non-federal partners in systematically reviewing all existing scientific literature to determine which public health interventions work, which do not, and which need further investigation. The findings of these systematic reviews are then presented to the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (Task Force), an independent, nonfederal group of internationally renowned public health experts, established by HHS and appointed by the Director of CDC. The Task Force uses the findings as the foundation for findings and recommendations about each intervention reviewed-to ensure that practice, policy, research, and funding decisions can be informed by the highest quality evidence. To date the Task Force has made evidence-based recommendations about the effectiveness of more than 215 population-based public health interventions, including five related to oral health.</p>
<p>Dental caries (tooth decay, cavities) continues to be a major problem for Americans. Ninety-six percent of adults aged 50-64 years have had dental caries. Tooth decay affects more than one-fourth of U.S. children aged 2-5 years and half of children aged 12-15 years. Children and adolescents from low-income families are hardest hit: about two-thirds of those aged 12-19 years have had caries, and one in four has untreated caries. Untreated tooth decay can cause pain, dysfunction, and absence from school, and poor appearance-problems that can greatly affect a child's quality of life.</p>
<p>Oral and pharyngeal cancers (i.e., cancer of the lip, tongue, floor of the mouth, palate, gingiva and alveolar mucosa, buccal mucosa, or oropharynx) continue to pose a threat to the health of U.S. adults, with no marked improvements in survival rates over the past several decades. In 2010, estimates show that more than 36,000 people learned they had mouth or throat cancer, and more than 7,800 (about 5,430 men and 2,450 women) died of these diseases. Early detection is important because the 5-year survival rate for early stage cancer is approximately 80%, while the survival rate drops to 9% for late-stage disease.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to fund a series of updates to the existing systematic reviews on oral health that were conducted for the Guide to Community Preventive Services, available at http://www.thecommunityguide.org/oral/oral-ajpm-ev-rev.pdf. These updates will ensure that the guidance provided by the Task Force regarding this topic area reflect the best evidence currently available. They will also involve the production of materials to clearly communicate the updated evidence and updated Task Force findings to key audiences of researchers, practitioners, and other relevant decision-makers. The updated reviews and related communication materials are expected to be extremely valuable for helping researchers and research-funding agencies to identify important gaps in our current knowledge, and for informing the actions of public health officials and other decision-makers. The ultimate goal of this project is to help to address the national priorities related to oral health as described in Healthy People 2020 (http://healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=32).</p>
<p><br />The specific systematic reviews to be updated in this project include:<br />&bull; Community water fluoridation <br />&bull; Statewide or community-wide dental sealant promotion programs<br />&bull; School-based or -linked dental sealant delivery programs<br />&bull; Population-based interventions for early detection of oral and pharyngeal pre-cancers and cancers<br />&bull; Population-based interventions to encourage use of helmets, facemasks, and mouthguards in contact sports</p>
<p>The offeror will be expected to conduct all phases of this project in a manner that is consistent with the standards and methods of the Guide to Community Preventive Services. For each intervention review to be updated, the offeror will be expected to: <br />1. Interface in teleconferences with a CDC subject matter expert, Community Guide scientist, Task Force member, and other experts regarding the appropriateness of intervention definition and causal model (or analytic framework) in the original review. If deemed appropriate for the update, minor ambiguities re: inclusion criteria should be clarified, with a goal of adhering as closely as possible to the inclusion criteria from original review.<br />2. Conduct thorough search of electronic databases for studies and systematic reviews meeting inclusion criteria for the period between the end date of the original paper and the present. This involves developing a draft search strategy and proposed databases to search, which will be subject to input and approval from CDC staff. Also, reference lists from relevant systematic reviews and papers should be reviewed for additional relevant studies. Search and subsequent data abstraction process should be managed with systematic review software that facilitates transparent recording and communication of the literature screening process.<br />3. Abstract relevant data from studies the meet inclusion criteria. Abstracted data should include the following:<br />a. Study design<br />b. Short description of intervention<br />c. Results for outcomes of interest (i.e., those identified as relevant in original review), as reported and transformed to the preferred metric for the review; provide confidence intervals around effect estimates when feasible<br />d. Major threats to internal and external validity<br />e. Information on effect modification variables (e.g., intervention intensity) that were identified in original review or identified as important by the subject matter experts <br />4. Summarize abstracted data in evidence tables<br />5. Submit files and documents providing details of all steps in the process to CDC <br />6. Synthesize results graphically, with descriptive statistics (median and interquartile interval), and/or with inferential statistics, as appropriate<br />7. Draft a revised Task Force finding and rationale statement based on the updated review (e.g., http://www.thecommunityguide.org/vaccines/universally/RRhomevisits.html)<br />8. Present results of updated review to the Task Force in person or via teleconference<br />9. Prepare a manuscript describing the completed reviews for peer-reviewed publication<br />10. Prepare summaries describing the interventions, updated Task Force findings, and key results for posting on the Community Guide website (e.g., http://www.thecommunityguide.org/oral/fluoridation.html)</p>
<p>In submission of a white paper, the offeror must address all of the tasks listed below.</p>
<p>Tasks:</p>
<p>a. Offerors should describe their approach to assembling a team of researchers with experience conducting systematic reviews of the effectiveness of interventions to improve health, particularly population health.</p>
<p>b. Offerors should describe their approach to soliciting and integrating feedback from experts in the subject matter and Community Guide methods to inform decisions regarding conceptualization of interventions and other key steps in the process.</p>
<p>c. Offerors should describe their organizational capacity for conducting a thorough literature search and for efficiently screening the results for interventions that meet the specified inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>d. Offerors should describe their approach to abstracting the relevant information from the qualifying studies, and for synthesizing the results in a way that can clearly and efficiently communicate the available information on intervention effectiveness to the Task Force and to other audiences.</p>
<p>e. Offerors should describe their approach to developing draft documents presenting the results of this project.</p>
<p>f. Offerors should describe their approach to collaborating closely with CDC to conduct these tasks, so as to keep their activities consistent with the original intent of this announcement.</p>
<p>PART III - WHITE PAPER SUBMISSION</p>
<p>Steps 1 and 2 provide for technical interchange prior to the submission of a formal proposal. Any questions or clarification of project objectives or methods may be directly discussed between the Government technical representatives and the potential offerors during the Technical Dialogue. The purpose of the Technical Dialogue is to obviate excessive expenditure of resources for projects that do not warrant consideration based on insufficient technical merits or funding limitations.</p>
<p>Use of Non-Government Personnel</p>
<p>Offerors are hereby notified that non-Government participants may have access to the offerors' white papers and that providing a white paper shall constitute consent to the disclosure of proprietary information to all non-Government participants in the white paper review process.

<p>Attachment (1) <br />DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT AND EVALUATION POLICY UNDERSTANDING</p>
<p>POLICY STATEMENT</p>
<p>CDC has a continuing interest in receiving and evaluating proposals containing new ideas, suggestions for researching ways to enhance the state-of-the-art in public health. However, Government personnel and contractors are constantly engaged in R&amp;D activities, and the substance of your proposal may already be known to Government employees or contractors, or may even be in the public domain. For such reasons it is desirable, when receiving proposals for evaluation, to insure that the persons submitting them are aware of the conditions under which the CDC will consider them.</p>
<p>It must be understood that the receipt and evaluation of the proposal by CDC does not imply a promise to pay, recognition of novelty or originality, or any relationship, which might require the Government to pay for use of information to which it is otherwise lawfully entitled.</p>
<p>Due care will be exercised to ensure that, in addition to technical design or concept data submitted, administrative and cost data will not be used by the Government for any purpose other than evaluation of the proposal. Administrative and cost data will not be disclosed to non-Government participants. Additionally, such data will not be disclosed outside the Government or be duplicated, used or disclosed in whole or in part by the Government, except for tracking and record purposes or to evaluate the proposal. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in such data if it is obtained from another source, or is in the public domain.</p>
<p>All research proposals will be treated as privileged information before award and contents will only be disclosed for purposes of evaluation. Your voluntary submission will be handled in accordance with established Government procedures for safeguarding such articles or information against unauthorized disclosure. All Government reviewers will be made aware that proposals sent to them are not to be duplicated, used, or disclosed in whole or in part for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, without the written permission of the offeror.</p>
<p>You should be aware that, despite all precautions, we may be able to protect the confidentiality of proposal only to the extent that it is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (see FAR Subpart 24.2).</p>
<p>Upon receipt, your proposal will be submitted to the appropriate technical experts for evaluation. Your proposal will undergo initial review within sixty (60) days after receipt. If additional time for this review is required, you will be notified in writing. Processing of proposals not declined as a result of the initial review may require as much as 120 days. <br /><br />Having read and understood the above policy, please execute and submit the following statements:</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF DISCLOSURE <br />PREFERENCE</p>
<p>0 This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, if a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of - or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.</p>
<p>0 The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]: ________________ ____________________________________ ____________________________________.</p>
<p>0 All data contained in this proposal are subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>0 Permission is hereby granted to CDC to evaluate this proposal, which may include evaluation by evaluators both within and outside the Government, with the understanding that written agreement not to disclose this information shall be obtained from any non-Government evaluator.<br />STATEMENT OF UNDERSTANDING <br />OF EVALUATION POLICY</p>
<p>It is understood that CDC has accepted the above proposal for the purpose of evaluating it and advising of any possible interest.</p>
<p>It is further understood that such acceptance does not imply or create a promise to pay; an obligation to give up any legal right or to assume any duty; a recognition of novelty, originality or priority; or any relationship, contractual or otherwise, such as would render the Government liable to pay for or give up any legal right or assume any obligation for disclosure or use of any information in the proposal to which the Government would otherwise lawfully be entitled.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />52.215-6 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE (OCT 1997)</p>
<p>(a) The offeror or respondent, in the performance of any contract resulting from this solicitation, 0 intends, 0 does not intend [check applicable block] to use one or more plants or facilities located at a different address from the address of the offeror or respondent as indicated in this proposal or response to request for information.</p>

<SUBJECT>Community Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (CHANES) - National Youth Fitness Survey (NYFS)
<SOLNBR>000HCPCG-2011-98331
<CONTACT>Kristopher A Lemaster, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882995, Fax 7704882670, Email klemaster@cdc.gov - Vivian S Hubbs, Team Lead, Phone (770) 488-2647, Fax (770) 488-2670, Email vhubbs@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to execute a contract modification to contract 200-2004-07072 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) with Westat, Inc. to exercise the Community Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (CHANES) option included in the original contract award as follows:
<p>I. Background and Need: The NCHS has received funds from the Department of Health and Human Services for a study to collect nationally representative data on physical activity and fitness in children and adolescents. Secretary Sebelius has dedicated funds to Obesity Prevention and Fitness, one of four critical priorities for the Department, in line with the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA): Laying the Foundation for Prevention. The Obesity Prevention and Fitness priority advances activities to improve nutrition and increase physical activity to promote healthy lifestyles and reduce obesity related conditions and costs.</p>
<p>One out of every three children in the U.S. is now overweight or obese, a condition that places them at greater risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, and cancer over the course of their lives. Regular physical activity in children and adolescents promotes health and fitness and may help to prevent obesity. In October 2008, the federal government issued its first-ever Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans to provide science-based guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health benefits for Americans. Guidelines for Children and Adolescents ask for 60 minutes or more of aerobic, muscle-strengthening, or physical activity daily.</p>
<p>While the number of children in the U.S. who meet the Physical Activity Guidelines is unknown, the percentage of children who are physically active in the U.S. is declining. In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006, a physical activity monitor was fielded for ages 6 years and older; in NHANES 1999-2004 cardiovascular fitness was reported as estimated maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) from a treadmill test for ages 12-49 years; and in 2011, NHANES implemented an upper body muscle strength component for ages 6 years and older. The collection of data on physical activity and fitness in National Youth Fitness Survey (NYFS) for children as young as 3 years of age would provide additional information with which to evaluate changes in physical activity and fitness and weight of children and adolescents over time.</p>
<p>II. Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The requirement is for a National Youth Fitness Survey (NYFS) dress rehearsal in 2011 to collect and deliver physical activity and fitness data on about 200 children and main NYFS data collection in NYFS 2012 to collect and deliver physical activity and fitness data from about 1,500 children.</p>
<p>III. Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The Community Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (CHANES) option of the NHANES contract was included to allow the opportunity to extend NHANES examinations to other populations not currently included in the survey. The funds received from the ACA allow the exercise of this option to study aspects of physical activity and fitness in 1500 additional children ages 3-15 via the National Youth Fitness Study (NYFS). The study will include tests of physical activity and fitness selected by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) staff with the input of experts in the fields of physical activity and kinesiology. <br />A general description of the tasks and deliverables to be accomplished during the project period is outlined below:<br />Task 1: Conduct a NYFS dress rehearsal in 2011 at two NHANES sites using refurbished trailers.<br />The contractor will furnish necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services to perform the work set forth below. The contractor will hire, train and monitor the interviewers and health technicians for the dress rehearsal and the NYFS. <br />Work under this contract will be monitored by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) for the CHANES NYFS (Lori Borrud) and COTR for the NHANES (George Zipf). <br />The dress rehearsal will be conducted concurrent with the regular NHANES mobile examination center at the sites, but will not be part of the NHANES. Children will be screened for participation in the dress rehearsal separately from the regular NHANES. The dress rehearsal will include approximately 200 children.</p>
<p>The examinations to be conducted will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Anthropometry (height, weight, and BMI), ages 3-15<br />&bull; Physical activity monitor (PAM), ages 3-15<br />&bull; Upper body muscle strength (hand grip), ages 6-15<br />&bull; Dietary interview, ages 3-15<br />&bull; Treadmill, ages 6-15<br />&bull; Gross motor skills, ages 3-5</p>
<p>Other tests may be added based on the results of a feasibility study to be conducted this June and July. A physician, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant will be present during all examinations in the refurbished trailer. $20 remuneration will be provided to the participants and a $30 incentive to parents, as well as coverage of transportation costs. When the PAM is returned, a remuneration of $40 will be sent to the parent.</p>
<p>In addition to the physical examinations, the dress rehearsal will include a household interview to collect socio-demographic information and data on usual physical activity and sedentary behavior.</p>
<p>Reports of Findings (ROF) will be provided to parents at the end of the examinations. This will include height, weight, body mass index at a minimum and potentially a measure of aerobic capacity from the treadmill test. The dress rehearsal will utilize NHANES survey methodology and data collection protocols.</p>
<p>Task 2: Conduct the NYFS using refurbished trailers at 15 NHANES sites in 2012.</p>
<p>The NYFS will be conducted concurrent with the regular NHANES mobile examination center at 15 NHANES sites in 2012, but will not be part of the NHANES. As in the dress rehearsal, participants will be selected in a screening process apart from the regular NHANES. The same interview and examination data collected during the dress rehearsal will be collected on approximately 1,500 children. A physician, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant will be present during all examinations in the refurbished trailers.</p>
<p>The same remuneration, incentive, and transportation costs will be provided.</p>
<p>Reports of Findings will be provided to parents at the end of the examinations. This will include height, weight, body mass index at a minimum and potentially a measure of aerobic capacity from the treadmill test. The NYFS will utilize NHANES survey methodology and data collection protocols.</p>
<p>Deliverables</p>
<p>The contractor will deliver the dress rehearsal and main study data to NCHS on a continuous basis using the current NHANES technology platform for file structure, programs, and routines.</p>
<p><br />Option 1: Conduct the NYFS at 15 NHANES sites in 2013. <br />The NYFS will be conducted concurrent with the regular NHANES mobile examination center at 15 NHANES sites in 2013, but will not be part of the NHANES. Participants will be selected in a screening process apart from the regular NHANES. Interview and examination data collected during the dress rehearsal will be collected on approximately 1,500 children. A physician, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant will be present during all examinations in trailers. <br />The examinations to be conducted will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Anthropometry (height, weight, and BMI), ages 3-15<br />&bull; Physical activity monitor (PAM), ages 3-15<br />&bull; Upper body muscle strength (hand grip), ages 6-15<br />&bull; Dietary interview, ages 3-15<br />&bull; Treadmill, ages 6-15<br />&bull; Gross motor skills, ages 3-5</p>
<p>Other tests may be added. A physician, nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant will be present during all examinations in the refurbished trailer. $20 remuneration will be provided to the participants and a $30 incentive to parents, as well as coverage of transportation costs. When the PAM is returned, a remuneration of $40 will be sent to the parent.</p>
<p>In addition to the physical examinations, the NYFS will include a household interview to collect socio-demographic information and data on usual physical activity and sedentary behavior.</p>
<p>Reports of Findings (ROF) will be provided to parents at the end of the examinations. This will include height, weight, body mass index at a minimum and potentially a measure of aerobic capacity from the treadmill test. The NYFS will utilize NHANES survey methodology and data collection protocols.</p>

<DESC>Extended Warranty on Department of Energy's Wide Area Radio System.
The U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Office (DOE-ORO) intends to contract with Motorola Solutions for an extension of the original Extended Warranty Contract on DOE?s Wide Area Radio System (WARS) equipment, which was competitively awarded effective November 23, 2004, with an extended warranty for infrastructure repair with advanced replacement.  The proposed extension of the Extended Warranty contract will include the repair costs plus loner modules, and technical/systems support.  The Wide Area Radio System is proprietary to Motorola Solutions hence technical support and replacement parts can only be provided by Motorola Solutions.  The warranty will be for a base period of one year, plus four one-year options.  
Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates their firm?s ability to provide an equivalent service and rationale as to why they should be considered, as described above.  All interested parties must respond by 2:00 PM (EST), June 30, 2011, to Judy Spillman, U.S. Department of Energy, 200 Administration Rd., AD-42, Oak Ridge, TN 37830.  Email: spillmanjk@oro.doe.gov. No reimbursement for any costs associated with providing the capability information will be provided by DOE.
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 13.5.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Contract No. F11PC00281TAS 14 5050
SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $150,000 
DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENTThe Work consists of replacing 6 existing basement windows (each residence) at Residences 1 and 3 (project total of 12 windows.)  Work must be coordinated with foundation repair, waterproofing, and insulation/new cladding at exposed above ground locations that will be ongoing at the residences at the same time.  The Independent Government Estimate (IGE) estimates the work to cost $17,250 if performed by the contractor to be already mobilized in Izembek for contract F11PC00182.  The IGE does not include costs for additional mobilization/demobilization.
SUPPORTING INFORMATION The Izembek Basement Window replacement at Residences 1 and 3 details window replacements that must interface with work that will be performed under existing contract F11PC00182.  The Contracted SOW calls for a new waterproofing system, new insulation, and a new sheet metal flashing system that covers the new insulation-waterproofing assembly.  The windows proposed to be replaced will need to interface with the new flashing assembly.  The integrity of the work under contract F11PC00182 might be compromised by windows installed after the foundation work at Residences 1 and 3 is performed.  The contractor has currently projected the schedule for the installation of these windows for June 5 - July 3, 2011.  If work was performed by 2 different contractors in the same area within overlapping warranty periods, the Government may have difficulty enforcing either warranty if a defect was discovered.  
Due to the remote nature of the work, the Government anticipates that work performed by a second contractor might add $8,000 to the IGE for mobilization and demobilization costs - a 50% premium to the cost of the work.  These costs can be avoided by using the contractor for contract F11PC00182 who will already be mobilized in Izembek at the time of this work. Work performed by 2 different contractors would also add management time for the Government Contracting Officer and Project Manager.  
EFFORTS TO LOCATE OTHER SOURCESThe government considered opening up the contract to quotes by contractors who bid on the initial contract.  Due to the anticipated additional cost, time constraints of the project, and the challenges of coordinating 2 contractors performing work on the same site at the same time, the government believes a sole source acquisition is the most cost effective and time efficient approach for this contract. Due to the substantial duplication of costs and anticipated unacceptable delays in schedule that would result in opening this acquisition for competition, the Contracting Officer has determined it is in the best interest of the Government to award a sole source contract to Heritage General Contracting, as competition will likely not produce a cost advantage.

<DESC><p>U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Officer of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Architecture Division for the following items: (112) Maintenance for Tracker for Windows and (56) Maintenance for PVCS Version Manager for Windows. OCIO proposes to enter into a contract on a basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition. This is a Sole Source Justification for the procurement of "Tracker" a software maintenance renewal. <br /><br /><br />Serena Version Manager holds numerous baselines and versions of software code for over 50 applications. This software code involves hundreds of thousands of files. Serena Tracker holds tens of thousands of system change requests and test problem reports for these same applications. This software offers the following simultaneously:<br /><br />1) Issue and defect management which easily searches for duplicates, and track things like find/fix rates with trend reporting. <br /><br />2) Incident and escalation management lets the user track time and state of incidents.<br /><br />3) Change request management offers the user an ITIL-inspired approach to capturing, routing, and prioritizing change request through the entire change process.<br /><br />Simultaneously offering these functions makes this software unique.</p>
<p>The requirement is to provide annual software maintenance. "Tracker" is the enterprise bug and defect tracking tool used to manage all system change requests (SCRs) and test problem reports (TPRs) for application. This software is also used throughout the application life cycle to improve application reliability, minimize downtime and reduce application deployment support costs. The requirement is also to provide annual software maintenance for Serena "Version Manager", a software asset, version management tool to control baselines, track check-ins, and/or role-back code. Version Manager Software is also used throughout the application life cycle. This manufacturer is the only one that provides the required upgrade and support services.</p>

State Relevance Of Purchase To Your Mission, Purpose, Research or Study:<br><br>The past few years have shown a disproportionate and growing number of combat and operational stress injuries, stress illnesses, and suicides with National Guard Service Members and their Families. Stress illnesses and injuries range from a Service Member having a significantly decreased work performance or marital conflict to PTSD, Depression, Anxiety and Substance Abuse. The most serious stress illness is suicidality. Reports for CY 2010 show 5 suicides, and 5 attempted suicides. Of note, an additional 3 deaths in CY 2010 are still under investigation, with the distinct possibility that the total for 2010 could reach an unprecedented 8 suicides. This unparalleled increase from previous years of recorded suicides is a lagging indication of the challenges Service Members and their Families face. Stress illnesses and injuries negatively impact mission readiness, performance and retention. The success of the Arizona National Guard requires a coordinated plan to build the Resiliency, Continuum of Care, Stress First Aid, and Suicide Prevention Training of AZNG Service Members and Families. Therefore, the Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) program is highly needed in the AZ ARNG, and has been approved by the Army G-1.<br><br>2.	Identify Supplies Or Services To Be Approved For Sole Source/Name Brand Treatment:<br><br>The AZ ARNG is in need of purchasing the copyrighted ASIST program that was developed in Canada by the contractor for delivery of suicide intervention training. The purchased program contains: Trainers Manual, Participant Workbooks, Suicide Intervention Handbook, one Canadian produced video (60 Minutes), Suicide Awareness manual and other program materials.  The Contractor will provide a Certificate of Qualification to each trainee upon the conclusion of the T4T training course.<br><br>The purpose of this contract is to provide training and consultation in connection with the purchased program that will prepare candidate trainers with the skill and abilities to implement the purchased program.<br><br>3.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>National Cancer Institute (NCI)<br />Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT)<br />Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid&reg; (caBIG&reg;)<br />Open Development Initiative (ODI)<br />Request for Information (RFI)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notice Number:</strong> HHS-NIH-NCI-RFI-2011-65<br /><br /><strong>Key Dates: <br /></strong>Release Date: June 21, 2011<br />Response Date: July 22, 2011<br /><strong><br />Issued by:</strong> <br />National Cancer Institute (NCI)</p>
<p><strong>I. Instructions<br /></strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT) is requesting information from open development community experts about models of open development applicable to the biomedical research community. This is a Request for Information only. Do not submit a proposal or quote. Interested parties are invited to review the information below and to make comments or suggestions. Nothing in this document should be considered binding or in any way obligate NCI CBIIT to perform. Although NCI CBIIT has identified questions of particular relevance, we welcome comments on any part of this document.<br /><br /><strong>II. Background and Goals<br /></strong><br />More than ever, cancer research is a collaborative science involving the coordinated efforts of clinicians, researchers, informaticians, and the patients themselves. The ability of these constituencies to meaningfully exchange information in a timely manner is critical to these endeavors and the challenge this presents is all too often a barrier to success. The types of data involved in translational research studies can be remarkably diverse - molecular, imaging, clinical, pathology - and all need to be managed, analyzed and correlated to support the discovery of new findings that will ultimately improve patient outcomes. Not only are the data diverse, but they are also dynamic - new platforms for molecular analysis are emerging and researchers need to be able to apply state of the art technology to the research question at hand. The rapid evolution of research drives a constant need for the development and improvement of information systems to help make sense of this data. <br />Meeting the challenge of creating robust and useful tools to support these rapidly evolving needs requires an open and collaborative approach to software development. The ability to modify software to support new data types, to analyze data using state of the art algorithms, and to integrate data in novel ways to support correlative studies are all required. The tools need to be able to evolve as rapidly as the science they support and they should be readily shared so that the broader community has access to innovative tools, thus benefiting the entire cancer research enterprise. <br /><br /><strong>caBIG&reg;: An Open Biomedical Informatics Network<br /></strong><br />In response to these critical needs, the NCI's caBIG&reg; program (http://cabig.nci.nih.gov) was launched in 2003 with the goal of building a biomedical informatics network to allow cancer researchers to collaborate more effectively, particularly with regard to the meaningful exchange of information. The key principles of the program are: open source, open access, open development and federation. Of these four principles, the first three pertain to the informatics tools developed through the program whereby the code is freely available to anyone to view, alter, and redistribute without restriction, and the development processes themselves are performed in a completely transparent and participatory manner. Since its inception, over 70 tools have been developed and enhanced through the caBIG&reg; program (http://tinyurl.com/2e2sjnx) and perhaps more importantly, a community of scientist, clinicians and informaticians across the biomedical research enterprise has formed with the common goal of working together to improve cancer research through a collaborative information network.<br /><br />Access to the source code of caBIG&reg; tools has allowed many adopting organizations to customize tools of interest to better support the specific requirements of their environment. At this time, however, there is not a consistent mechanism for accessing the current development version of the code or, especially, for contributing custom code back to the main distribution of the tool. Therefore, customizations that may be freely offered and broadly useful are not readily available to other groups. Moreover, it is difficult for organizations that have a locally customized version of the code to upgrade to the latest version and therefore stay in synchronization with the regular releases. Providing a means to easily connect these community contributors to the codebase and a means for them to participate in the governance of supported code releases will provide a more transparent and consistent means to keep all of these in alignment when possible and appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Building a caBIG&reg; Open Development Initiative<br /><br /></strong>The caBIG&reg; program has approached an inflection point due to a number of factors, including: <br /><br />&bull; The expansion of the scope of caBIG&reg; beyond support for cancer research, to research in other disease areas, and connections with healthcare and regulatory agencies<br />&bull; Numerous examples of extra-governmental groups (including private organizations and groups outside the United States) wanting to contribute to the program<br />&bull; The intense community interest in sharing in the development and direction of the tools and infrastructure on which they are becoming increasingly dependent<br />These factors present a unique and tremendous opportunity to evolve the next generation of caBIG&reg; to a robust, community driven, open development ecosystem. Ideally, this ecosystem will involve a broader community of information technology professionals from diverse fields in building the tools and infrastructure to drive the future of cancer research. Successful open development ecosystems exist both within and beyond the biomedical domain and governance and infrastructure supporting these initiatives is diverse. A thorough understanding of these approaches and related issues will be important for informing the strategy for creating a caBIG&reg; open development initiative.<br /><br /><strong>III. Information Requested<br /><br /></strong>NCI CBIIT is interested in learning about the types of collaborative development models employed in open development communities and would like to learn about, and receive input from, organizations - for-profit and not-for-profit - that have experience building, coordinating and managing such models. The goal of this RFI is to identify the range of issues and needs related to business and technical governance as well as the necessary components of a technical infrastructure needed to support an open development initiative.<br /><br />Organizations with significant experience in creating and/or managing open development communities should submit a response of no more than 5 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font minimum that addresses the topics described above (see questions below for additional guidance). The Government will not review any other data or attachments that are in excess of 5 pages. In response to the RFI, interested parties shall submit the following information no later than July 22, 2011, 4 PM Eastern Daylight Time to Juli Klemm (juli.klemm@nih.gov) and John Speakman (john.speakman@nih.gov). Any inquiries or questions can be directed to Juli Klemm. <br /><br />Please provide the following information in response to the RFI.<br /><br /><strong><em>Organizational Information<br /><br /></em>Name of Organization:</strong> <br /><br /><strong>Type of Organization:</strong> (For-profit company, Non-profit entity, College or University, Government agency)<br /><br /><strong>Organization Point of Contact:</strong> (Name, Address, Phone, E-Mail)<br /><br /><strong>Experience:</strong> Describe the direct experience your organization has with building, organizing, participating in, and/or managing open development initiatives. <br /><br />Please be specific about the role or your organization in the initiative(s) and its current status. <br /><br /><strong><em>General Information<br /></em></strong><br />We welcome all feedback from experienced entities regarding considerations for creating an open development initiative for caBIG&reg;. The following questions are of particular interest to NCI CBIIT. Responses do not need to be structured around these questions but they are provided as guidance for specific issues of interest. Of highest value will be addressing these issues in the context of first-hand experience with building, coordinating, and/or managing an open development community.<br /><br />1. Which open source ecosystems are most successful and how could they inform the structure and governance of a caBIG&reg; Open Development Initiative?<br />2. What are best practices for guiding institutions in the transition from software users to open development participants?<br />3. What types of governance structures should be considered and what are the most important aspects?<br />4. What types of business models are likely to result in a fiscally self-sufficient initiative?<br />5. What organizational structures and processes enable effective open source product management?<br />6. What kind of input should NCI, standards organizations, the community, and other interested parties have in the technical direction or the evolution of caBIG&reg; technology?<br />7. What are the most important elements of communication that will promote community awareness and participation?<br />8. What features of a common code repository make it most useful to an open source ecosystem?<br />9. What methods of generating, sharing, and maintaining documentation provide the most value to the open source community?<br />10. What actions should be taken to foster innovation and growth of the ecosystem?<br />11.

Justification for Brand Name ProductsDate:	June 16, 2011Project:	Purchase a sewage pump for Canyon Wastewater Treatment Plant in Yellowstone National Park.1.	Identificationsa.	Agency:	National Park Serviceb.	Contracting Office:	Northern Rockies MABP-Yellowstone National Park
2. Description of the action being approved:The National Park Service (NPS) shall be soliciting for sewage pumps from Gorman-Rupp vendors only. The documents included with the solicitation call for specific brand name products that are peculiar to one manufacturer. This written justification provides approval for limiting competition to the listed brand name products as authorized by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).
3. Description of Supply Gorman-Rupp Pump Model S3A1-46DV39, 5hp industrial submersible with 75' cable, no control panel needed.	  4. Authority:	a. 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.b. FAR Part 11.105: The Brand Name products are essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products do not meet and cannot be modified to meet the agency's needs.c. FAR 6.302-1: The use of the name brand products are essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.
5. The description of the product's unique qualifications or the unique nature of the acquisition:This sewage pump will replace an existing pump in the Canyon Wastewater Treatment Plant and the old one will become a backup pump.  The two pumps need to be interchangeable. If a sewage pump goes down, the pump has to be replaced immediately. A sewer spill is a hazard to the Canyon area, humans, animals and environment.  These pumps have to fit into the existing structure of the plant. This sewer plant is automated; so to change any part would involve a major engineering re-design and the costs would be exorbitant.  This would not be a cost effective nor time effective way to use the government's monies. 
6. Efforts to obtain competition:a. Efforts to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:This special notice is being posted on Fed Biz Ops. Email combined synopsis/solicitation will be sent to interested vendors.  
7. Determination that costs will be fair & reasonable:The government will verify the price for the product is fair and reasonable by comparing pricing on identical and similar items purchased recently.   The government will also use price analysis completed during product research to make sure that pricing is fair and reasonable.
8.  Description of the market research conducted:The government conducted product research and decided that for the application the horsepower and frame size of the Gorman-Rupp model S3A1 best fits into its application.  The government compared pump frame size, horsepower, pump curves, pricing and availability of other manufactures.  These pumps need to fit into an existing structure, to design and reengineer would not be an efficient use of the government's monies.
9. Other facts supporting other than full & open competition:
a. Reason why documents suitable for full & open competition have not been developed:Refer to item 5 above.b. Data, estimated costs or other rationale as to the extent or harm to the Government:Refer to item 5 above.
10. Interested Sources: Interested sources should email Andrea_Hannon@nps.gov  11. Actions to remove barriers to competition in the future for similar acquisitions:The government is working to develop protocol for new engineering that will be compatible to different pumping platforms.  This will make replacement and future upgrades open to further competition.

ATTACHMENT 1 
BACKGROUND: The Navy/Marine Corps must exploit all possible technologies to detect and classify battlefield threats. The SWIR detection system will be used in conjunction with other sensors during the day, night and adverse weather operations.  It will be employed in the open terrain and urban environments as an additional method to increase battlefield situational awareness and as a means to rapidly improve detection and classification of personnel, vehicles and other objects.
 NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane is requesting market survey information relative to the maturity and availability of SWIR systems for potential incorporation into existing and future Navy/Marine Corps surveillance system programs.  The technology maturity must be, at a minimum, at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 per the Department of Defense (DOD) Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) Desktop Reference dated July 2009 (http://www.dod.gov/ddre/doc/DoD_TRA_July_2009_Read_Version.pdf) and the Technology Readiness Assessment Guidance Reference dated April 2011 (http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/publications/docs/TRA2011.pdf).  In order to be considered a TRL 6, a system/subsystem model or prototype must be demonstrated in a relevant environment.
  A relevant environment is a testing environment that simulates both the most important and most stressing aspects of the operational environment.  Sources are requested to provide information in the form of white papers on their existing SWIR technologies.    
 The following information needs to be addressed in response to this RFI:
a)	Provide a summary on the technical principles of how the system functions. 
b)	Describe the rationale/tactical advantages of the system.
c)	Has the system been in an operational field environment?
d)	What is the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the system?  If the technology is currently fielded, who are the current customers?
e)	Is the system current configuration hand-held or platform mounted?
f)	What are the minimum and maximum ranges of detection and identification of personnel, vehicles and other objects that the system is capable of achieving?  Please quantify these ranges with respect to ambient light levels; density of smoke, fog and dust; water; glass and any other obstruction not specified herein that may be beneficial to the war fighter.
g)	Is the system capable of providing spatial coordinates of a detected person, vehicle or object? Describe the system's ability to provide an accurate location of the detected person, vehicle or object as distance increases in terms of error or uncertainty.
 What is the localization error associated with a detection?
h)	Does the system incorporate a laser pointer, illuminator or rangefinder?  What are the parameters / specifications of the laser? What is the spectral sensitivity of the system?
i)	What is the minimum illumination required for operation at night?  
j)	What is the Field of Regard (FOR) of the system? Is the systems lens focal length fixed or variable? Please describe the focal lengths and their associated resolutions?
k)	Describe any potential safety hazards with the use of the system or technology.
l)	What is the current Size Weight and Power (SWaP) of the system and is the design performance scalable to SWaP (i.e. if size, weight or power were increased, would performance or detection distance increase as well)?
m)	Describe the system display characteristics and specifications.
 
n)	Describe the system's capability to operate 24/7 and elaborate on any typical planned (e.g., periodic) or unplanned maintenance required.
o)	Does the system have recordable output (e.g. imagery, detection declarations, time/position/pointing data, etc.)? Is the system capable of capturing and saving images in variable formats (i.e. .jpg and .tif)? Is the format user selectable?
p)	Specify the command and control interface and video format.
q)	Has the system been subjected to MIL-STD-810 testing? Elaborate on the tests for which the system was subject to as well as the results from those tests.
r)	How has the system been tested for performance? Elaborate on test design and results while addressing probability of detection and false alarm rates.
  Causes/sources of false alarms should be identified to the extent known. 
s)	Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) on the anticipated unit cost of the system.
t)	Provide a brief description of the firm including whether the firm is identified as a large or small business.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific onbehalf of the Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Joint Tactical RadioSystem (JTRS) Network Enterprise Domain (NED), is announcing an intent to formnon-contractual relationships with vendors of JTRS-capable radios to make theJTRS Enterprise Network Manager (JENM) compatible with these radios.  Thisnotice is issued solely to inform vendors of the NED strategy and encourageIndustry participation in this strategy.  It does not constitute a Request forProposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Responses to thisnotice are not offers and do not commit the Government to a contract for anysupply or service whatsoever.  At this time, the government is not seekingproposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advisedthat the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costsincurred in response to this notice and that all costs incurred or associatedwith responding to this notice will be solely at the interested partysexpense.The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Network Enterprise Domain (NED) hascontracted development of the JTRS Enterprise Network Manager (JENM).  JENMenables planning, instantiation, management and over-the-air reconfiguration oftactical networks comprised of software-defined radios from multiple vendors,greatly simplifying network planning and operations as compared to usingseparate management products provided by each qualified radio vendor.  NED isinterested in sharing JENM development plans with radio vendors utilizing theSoldier Radio Waveform (SRW), Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW), and MobileUser Objective System (MUOS) waveform in their tactical radios to generateinterest in vendor participation in JENM development, integration, andtesting.  NED encourages vendors to develop JTRS-capable radios that caninterface with JENM for planning, configuration, reconfiguration, andmonitoring.  JENM Phase 1 is planned for a July 2011 release.  JENM Phase 2design is underway with Formal Qualification Test (FQT) expected in 1Q2012.JENM Phase 3 is not yet under contract.NED will fund the JENM developer to build JENM interfaces with participatingradio vendors who agree to develop the radio side of the interface with JENM attheir own expense.  Participating radio vendors will be expected to providenecessary interface information and lend equipment to the JENM developer forintegration and test.  If the JENM development contractor opts to offer aJTRS-capable radio in this effort, that contractor will be expected to isolateJENM development from JTRS-capable radio development to ensure confidentialityof information provided by other radio vendors.NED has developed a generic Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that more fullydescribes the proposed relationship for this effort.  NED is offering tonegotiate specific terms of this generic MOU with radio vendors who havedeveloped or expect to develop a JTRS-capable radio intended for production andfielding within the JENM development and deployment period.This initiative is in support of the JTRS Enterprise Business Model, whichallows radio developers access to JTRS software for integration into theirproducts without government contracts and funding.  The JTRS EnterpriseBusiness Model is designed to stimulate competition, increase innovation andreduce government costs through software reuse while simultaneously speedingdevelopment and fielding of tactical networking capabilities.  JENM support forradio products developed under the JTRS Enterprise Business Model represents aunique government and industry relationship to aggressively deliver advancedtactical networking capabilities to joint warfighters.Questions concerning this announcement may be directed to Timothy J.

Re:	VISN 18 Vendor Fair/Demonstration


Dear Vendor Representatives:
VA Southwest Health Care Network (VISN 18) is inviting prospective vendors who can provide 
Medical grade point of care PCs (both all-in-one units and separate units) systems to a meeting at the Tucson VA Health Care on July 12, 2011.

Meeting objectives for VISN 18 participants are to understand and become familiar with commercial off-the-shelf clinical information system point of care hardware products and to conduct market research to understand clinical features and functions commonly available in modern commercial offerings. Attendees will identify functional requirements for VISN 18 systems. Your participation will help educate our staff about modern systems so that we may refine our system requirements, including but not limited to the following items:
Medical grade point of care PCs (both all-in-one units and separate units)
Mini pc
Touch screen displays
Mouse/track ball/track pad option
Keyboard skins
Mounting hardware solutions

Please Note: We consider this meeting to be "market research." We are not "evaluating" your products against other vendors' products. Rather, we seek to identify important features and functions to VISN 18 that are commonly available in commercial product offerings. You should neither consider your company as favored in any fashion by VISN 18, nor should you consider VISN 18 under any obligation to your company as a result of your participation in this meeting. VISN 18 intends to formally solicit proposals from multiple sources within the next several months from some or all vendors participating in this meeting as well as other vendors. 
While interacting with VA staff, you may find it beneficial to know their role (physician, nurse, ICU or anesthesia, Biomedical Engineering, etc). However, you should have no need to capture and retain names of VA personnel. Should VA personnel request additional or follow up information, please refer them to VISN Project Leadership and/or furnish the information via Carlos Leon, VISN 18 Contracting Officer. Mr. Leon will then share the information with VA staff as appropriate.  
Logistical Information
The Conference Rooms will be available to begin setting up at 7:30 AM on July 12, 2011. The meeting will run until 4 PM. 

We ask that your representatives wear name badges identifying name and company at all times.   

You may hand out brochures and other literature. Any electronic files should be given to Jane Mitchell for distribution to VISN 18 staff. 
The audience for these presentations will include Nurses, Physicians, Anesthesiologists, CNRAs, Clinical Applications Coordinators, Biomedical Engineering, IT, Contracting, Administrators, and other stakeholders. 
Please be prepared to present on the topics below, as appropriate:
"	High level executive summary of your product offerings 
"	Product overviews, including clinical champion using system (25 minutes or less)  
"	Product overviews (25 minutes or less)
"	Hands-on demonstrations of products
"	Technical discussion including an overview of system architecture (hardware, operating system, database, application), medical device interfacing, network requirements (LAN, Wireless, WAN), and VistA interfaces (30 minutes)

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

DESCRIPTION: Occupational therapist and occupational therapy assistants are part of the education team within a school district.  The profession of occupational therapy is concerned with a person's ability to participate in desired daily life activities or "occupations".  In the schools, occupational therapists use their unique expertise to help children to be prepared for and perform important learning and school related activities and to fulfill their role as students.  In this setting, occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants support academic outcomes including social skills, math, reading, writing, recess, participation in sports, self-help skills, prevocational/vocational participation and more, for children and students with disabilities, 3 to 21 years of age.  They are particularly skilled in facilitating access to curricular and extra-curricular activities for all students through supports, design planning, and other methods.  Additionally, they play a critical role in training parents, other staff members, and caregivers regarding educating students with diverse learning needs.
An occupational therapist is a trained health care professional that uses purposeful, goal directed activities and task analysis to enable children with a disability to benefit from their individualized education programs (IEP's).  Federal law mandates that occupational therapy (OT) in the school system be educationally relevant.  In the school setting, Occupational therapy is a "related service" to special education under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Act.  This means services must enhance or support educational goals as stated on the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP).  Occupational Therapists in the school setting look at certain skills issues which may interfere with a child's educational performance such as hand function, oral motor function, visual motor and perceptual skills, sensory awareness/processing, self-care and pre-vocational tasks.  These areas can be addressed through a variety of intervention strategies, which may include direct therapy with the child, consultation with the teacher, modification of the environmental, provision of adaptive equipment, and staff training.
Referrals for occupational therapy in the school system are made via the Student Study Team.  This team may be included but is not limited to: parent, teachers and other, appropriate to the student's educational program.  This team delineates concerns and makes a recommendation for a screening that is implemented strategies and/or decide new strategies to implement to address concerns, based upon the feedback from the occupational therapist that team will determine if further information/evaluation is warranted.

Delivery notification is critical because many of Western's delivery locations are unmanned stations located in remote areas that do not have receiving docks or unloading equipment. Proper notification will ensure that Western personnel are on site and have the equipment necessary to unload the shipment. c. If the contractor fails to make the required advance notification, the Government may not be able to receive the equipment. Any additional costs incurred by the Government to properly receive and/or relocate the equipment that are caused by the contractor's failure to provide sufficient advance notification will be charged to the contractor under the terms of this contract. The designated Government representative is: _Mark Depoe_: work (602) 605-2687 or cell (602) 717-9335; or _Dave Gedlinske_: 602-605-2732.<br /><br />WES-F-1002 Requirement to Unload Equipment at the Destination (WAPA, FEB 2008)<br />a. The contractor is responsible for unloading the equipment specified in CLIN(s) ALL to a ground level pad within the substation or other specific location as directed by the Government. The contractor must provide any specialized unloading equipment or truck features that are necessary to unload the equipment. The contractor's costs for properly configured trucks and unloading the equipment at the delivery location shall be included in the quoted price. b. Responsibility for loss or damage to the equipment shall remain with the contractor until the Government accepts the equipment at the destination. If the equipment is rejected due to failure to conform to the contract requirements, the risk of loss or damage shall remain with the contractor until the defects are corrected and the equipment is subsequently accepted by the Government.<br /><br />WES-H-1043 Foreign Visitors and Contract Employees (WAPA, MAY 2005)<br />The Contractor must receive prior, written approval from the appropriate Western Security Manager (WSM) before any non-U.S. Citizens (Foreign Nationals) visit or work at any Western Area Power Administration (Western) facility. The Contractor must certify in writing that: 1) each of their employees working under this contract that may visit or be assigned to work at any Western facility is a U.S. Citizen, or; 2) the Contractor shall provide an accurately completed Foreign National Data Card, WAPA Form 3000-72, Attachment (available upon request, if necessary) for each of their Foreign National employees that may visit or work at any Western facility. The Contractor shall forward the completed Form to the COR at least 45 days in advance of each Foreign National employee's visit or their beginning of work. Foreign National employees shall not be allowed on-site at any Western facility without prior approval of the cognizant WSM. Circumstances which do not allow a 45 day notification require prior, written approval of the cognizant WSM. The Contractor shall include this requirement in any subcontract it issues under this contract.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order for the supplies listed below. The requirement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.106.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 11-223-SOL-00124. This is a 100% small business set-aside.<br /><br />This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-52, May 31, 2011.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334513 - Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The measurement of the size of particles is critical to the function of the FDA/NCTR/ORA Nanotechnology Core Facility that is supporting the nanotechnology needs of NCTR and the Arkansas Regional Laboratory of the Office of Regulatory Affairs, which are co-located on the Jefferson Laboratories Campus.</p>
<p>Two key pieces of information that are needed for instruments to accurately measure the particle size (which is based on movement) are the temperature and viscosity of the solution in which the particle is suspended. Most devices that are used to measure particle size have temperature measurement or temperature control; however, none have the ability to measure the viscosity of the solutions. FDA seeks to purchase a viscosity measuring device (viscometer) that uses small volumes of sample to measure the viscosity.</p>
<p>Statement of Work <br />Item #1 Viscometer<br />The system must meet the following specifications:<br />- viscometer measuring viscosity of liquids typically used in biological experiments (e.g. water, buffers, blood/serum).<br />- small sample volume (&lt;100 microliters minimal volume).<br />- choice of sample viscosity ranges on the instrument with one range covering<br />approximately 0.5 centipoise (cP) to 10 cP.<br />- viscosity repeatability of +1% (time required for +1% repeatability should be stated).<br />- viscosity measurement accuracy of at least +1% with NIST or NIST-traceable<br />Standards (time required for accuracy should be stated).<br />- NIST or NIST-traceable standards included (at least three standard solutions approximately 0.9, 5 and 10 cP).<br />- precision temperature control using either circulating water bath or Peltier with tight temperature control (+0.1 &deg;C or better).<br />- temperature range of 4 &deg;C to 50 &ordm;C .<br />- computer or microprocessor control with capability to print results (if computer controlled the computer should be included in quotation).<br />-Provide inside delivery, installation, on-site training, and warranty.</p>
<p>Quotes must include prices for product inclusive of shipping charges.</p>
<p>Optional Items:</p>
<p>Item #2: Option Yr 1 - Service/Maintenance Agreement after initial warranty. <br />Item #3: Option Yr 2 - Service/Maintenance Agreement after expiration of option year 1.<br />Item #4: Option Yr 3 - Service/Maintenance Agreement after expiration of option year 2.<br />Item #5: Option Yr 4 - Service/Maintenance Agreement after expiration of option year 3.<br />Item #6: Additional Viscometer</p>

<p><br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) located in Jefferson, Arkansas is conducting a two-year rat chronic Bisphenol A (BPA) study. The study requires minimal background exposure to BPA in caging materials. As part of a complex of studies designed to target potential toxic effects of BPA, a monomer used in production of certain plastics widely used in food contact materials at low levels of exposure, caging and isolator tops are required to leach low levels of BPA. For a prior rat range-finding study (E2176.01) and current mouse diet study (E218301), NCTR chemists assessed and developed a protocol that demonstrated polysulfone cages manufacturer by Ancare leached minimal BPA (1,000-fold less) relative to commercially available caging comprised of other materials . To maintain study continuity, polysulfone cages and isolator tops shall be warranted for the 2-yarr rat chronic BPA study.</p>
<p><br />Only new materials will be considered. Used and refurbished caging and equipment is not acceptable.</p>

Background The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information. The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by "bridges". The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics. The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 out-patient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol. The Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&IS) provides imaging services to the CC patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH institutes. Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures). Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the RAD& IS's Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). The departmental radiologists review the diagnostic images and dictate clinical findings using a Voice Recognition system (VRS).

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.
 The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.
The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Naval Inventory Control Point Philadelphia Source Approval Information Brochure.
  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.
  The NAVICP Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx"

<DESC>This is a non-competitive combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation No. DTRT57-11-Q-80089 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50, effective May 16, 2011. The NAICS Code is 423430 and the Small Business size standard is 100 Employees. This sole source announcement constitutes the only solicitation. A written solicitation will not be issued. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order on a non-competitive basis to Global IDs, Princeton, NJ. The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) has a requirement to purchase a 90-day Software License, Global IDs Data Warehouse Product Suite V7.1 to support a data profiling and characterization effort, in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) below.
<p>Statement of Work (SOW) - Begin</p>
<p>The Volpe Center provides support to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of Aviation Safety (AVS), which requires a new generation of data integration tools to manage complex data environments and automate data governance. These tools will be used to migrate legacy stove pipe application data sets into integrated enterprise structures for the Regulation and Certification Infrastructure for System Safety (RCISS) Data Warehouse program.</p>
<p>The Volpe Center will work with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), AQS-230 personnel and the Office of Flight Standards (AFS) Data Governance Board to identify a suitable commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) data analysis tool. The COTS tool must support data discovery functionality as the AVS organization prepares to transition aviation safety information into a data warehouse environment. The COTS tool at a minimum must support (a) data governance/stewardship, (b) impact assessment of data changes, (c) data integration and (d) tool integration which are key activities in moving AVS system owners to a wider acceptance of data services provided through a data warehouse.</p>
<p>Based upon initial market research of master data management (MDM) products performed by the FAA, the Volpe Center will procure a 90 day license for a Global IDs Data Governance Product Suite V7.1 software license to support a data profiling and characterization effort.</p>
<p>Using the COTS MDM tool, The Volpe Center will perform an analysis between the enhanced Flight Standards Automation System (eFSAS) and the legacy FSAS data sets to reconcile and consolidate the data. The eFSAS data will be obtained from the new eFSAS pilot environment and the FSAS legacy data will be obtained from the mainframe. These data sets currently reside at the Enterprise Data Center (EDC) at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma City, OK. Once all the data set information is collected, the Volpe Center will begin analysis using the COTS tool. The tool "crawls" through the database and by using meta data will determine the schema and various other sets of meta data. Through this process the Volpe Center will identify those data entities (tables) and attributes (data) that appear to be common across eFSAS and FSAS systems.</p>
<p>This eFSAS and FSAS data analysis will remediate differences found between the recently migrated FSAS mainframe National Database (163 tables) and the consolidated eFSAS pilot database (271 tables). The basic steps in this analysis process are outlined as follows:<br />&bull; Scan FSAS and EFSAS databases <br />&bull; Profile metadata for values, patterns, and relationships<br />&bull; Map and compare schemas<br />&bull; Extract, execute, and analyze business rules<br />&bull; Verify standard domains (e.g., addresses, names, phone numbers)<br />&bull; Verify and remedy inappropriate values<br />&bull; Create reconciled models (e.g. logical, physical)<br />&bull; Apply business rules and load verified data into reconciled eFSAS database<br />&bull; <br />To prepare for the data analysis effort the Volpe Center will prepare an Evaluation Plan that clearly identifies the objectives, scope, methodology used and evaluation schedule planned for this data analysis work. The Volpe Center will participate in a web-based training session provided by the contractor to fully understand the capabilities of the MDM tool and ensure its proper application throughout the data analysis phase. In addition, the contractor shall provide remote technical assistance throughout the 90 day period.</p>
<p>All data findings resulting from this analysis will be documented in a Data Analysis Report. The Data Analysis Report will identify common data entities between eFSAS and FSAS data sets and clearly indicate the common entity attribute information (data type, length, and format) for each system. A proposed common entity recommendation will be included in the final report as well as a data dictionary for those data elements (attributes) that are candidates for reconciliation. In doing this work AVS will capture significant business benefits and cost savings by employing the COTS tool to support the eFSAS-FSAS reconciliation and consolidation.</p>
<p>If the eFSAS to FSAS analysis effort concludes within 45 days after initiation of this task, an additional data analysis will be performed. This second analysis will focus upon airman data maintained in the FAA Registry system. Registry Information associated with airman that is applicable to eFSAS functionality will be included and reconciled in a similar fashion to that described above. For example, FAA Registry check airman, check pilot, training center evaluator (TCE) designees, and CFR 142 designees are envisioned as possible data domains to be reconciled with the eFSAS pilot system.</p>
<p>C.1 Deliverables</p>
<p>The contractor shall permit the Volpe Center to download its Data Governance Product Suite V7.1 software via GIDs portal environment (takes about 20-30 minutes). In addition, The contractor shall send this information to Volpe Center Project Manager, Steve Czapczynski, RVT-32, US DOT/Volpe Center, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02142, 617-494-2841, steve.czapczynski@dot.gov.<br /><br />The resulting purchase order shall be in effect from July 11, 2011 through November 30, 2011.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW) - End</p>
<p>The contract line items (CLINs) are as follows -</p>
<p>CLIN 0001, 90 - day Global ID software license, Quantity: 3 mo., Unit Price $_______________, Total Price $______________; CLIN 0002, Remote training, Quantity: 1 EA,&nbsp;$___________, Total Price $____________; CLIN 0003, Remote technical support, Unit Price $___________, Total Price $___________.

The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to George Washington University, School of Public Health and Health Services, Department of Health Policy, 2021 K. Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC, for updated legal surveys and analyses of state laws related to (1) vaccination benefits for adult Medicaid beneficiaries, (2) provision of vaccination services by non-physician healthcare providers under standing orders, and (3) vaccination requirements for employees and residents in long-term care facilities, based on three previous reviews conducted by George Washington University. Purpose and Objective: Legislative Review &amp; Analysis of State Laws Related to Immunization. The purpose of this project is to update three comprehensive legislative reviews exploring laws related to immunization in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Topics covered by these reviews include (1) vaccination benefits offered to adult Medicaid beneficiaries, (2) scope of immunization practice by non-physician practitioners under their own license and standing orders protocols, and (3) vaccination requirements for staff and residents at long-term care facilities. State immunization laws are constantly evolving in response to new scientific discoveries, political pressures, and other external factors. Updating these reviews will ensure that CDC has access to the most current information available related to state immunization laws. This information is critical to CDC&rsquo;s ability to (1) track the impact of healthcare reform on access to vaccination benefits and (2) to conduct and provide technical assistance for emergency preparedness planning that fully utilizes available healthcare resources in each state. Public health authorities at the national, state, and local levels will benefit from understanding how non-physician providers can be used to expand vaccination opportunities both during pandemic or bioterrorism events as well as during non-emergency vaccination campaigns. Policymakers and researchers can use information about Medicaid vaccination benefits to monitor potential disparities in access between currently eligible beneficiaries and those who gain coverage under Affordable Care Act expansions of Medicaid. The goal of this contract is to build on work already completed by researchers at the George Washington University (GWU) School of Public Health and Health Services as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law project. GWU published three reports on the above-referenced topics between Winter 2003 and Winter 2007 (research was completed from approximately Spring 2003 to Spring 2007). These reports have served as important references for CDC researchers and grantees in the interim. CDC is perceived by state and local health authorities and researchers as the preeminent resource for information related to public health, up to and including laws and regulations governing public health. As a result, the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases regularly receives queries from the public on aspects of state law pertaining to immunization. The updates proposed in the present statement of work will provide CDC with the information needed to furnish appropriate technical assistance to its grantees and to the public, as well as targeting our efforts in collaboration with professional and other organizations. Specific objectives of this contract are to: (1) Update the 2003 report produced for CDC as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law to include new legislation as needed: &ldquo;Medicaid Coverage of Immunizations for Non-Institutionalized Adults.&rdquo; (2) Update the 2007 report produced for CDC as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law to include new legislation as needed: &ldquo;State Laws Related to the Use of Standing Orders Covering Immunization Practice.&rdquo; (3) Update the 2005 report produced for CDC as part of The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law to include new legislation as needed: &ldquo;Immunization Requirements for Staff and Residents of Long-Term Care Facilities Under State Laws/Regulations&rdquo; (4) Update the project website housed at www.gwumc.edu/sphhs/departments/healthpolicy/immunization/ to display the updated reports and related materials as necessary. (5) Develop and submit manuscripts to peer-reviewed, legal and public health journals and health professional newsletters and magazines disseminating findings of updated legal review. Background and overview: CDC provided initial funding for The Epidemiology of U.S. Immunization Law in 2002. The overall goals of the Project were to achieve greater understanding of the policy barriers to immunization financing and access and furnish technical assistance support to initiatives that promote change. These reports have served as important references for CDC researchers and grantees in the interim. During the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic, there was particular interest in understanding how non-physician providers could assist in mass vaccination efforts in order to rapidly increase communitywide coverage with 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. However, interest in expanding access to vaccination services has prompted changes in state law since 2007, particularly with regard to immunization practice by pharmacists. In addition, personnel shortages experienced during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic response may have prompted states to expand the scope of practice of non-physician providers in preparation for future emergency response activities. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 expands Medicaid eligibility to persons living at up to 133% of the federal poverty level, representing a significant expansion in coverage for childless adults. Newly-eligible Medicaid beneficiaries will have access to all ACIP-recommended vaccines without cost-sharing as determined by provisions of the ACA; however, current adult Medicaid beneficiaries are not covered by these provisions. In order for CDC to monitor the effect of the ACA on access to vaccinations, a baseline level of benefits must be established. Since GWU&rsquo;s initial report, three new vaccines (human papillomavirus, tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, and herpes zoster vaccine) have been recommended for use among some adults 18-64. In addition, increasing budgetary pressures at the state government level have likely affected benefits provided to current Medicaid-eligible adults. Increased interest in vaccination of healthcare personnel as an important indicator of healthcare quality has increased the prominence, and potentially the prevalence, of state laws requiring vaccination of healthcare personnel in various healthcare settings. The Joint Commission is currently updating its accreditation standard for influenza vaccination of staff in long-term care facilities to expand the facilities covered and the activities required for accreditation. A review of current laws related to vaccination requirements in long-term care facilities will determine which states may be better equipped to comply with national reporting requirements related to vaccination of healthcare personnel in long-term care settings. With the exception of the proposed contractor, no organization or unit within or outside CDC currently tracks and summarizes laws related to the above-referenced topics. In the absence of the proposed review, there is no central repository of legal information that can inform the planning, monitoring, and technical assistance activities described in Section 1.0. Scope of Work: For this project, the Contractor will submit a plan for completion of the work described herein. Throughout the award period, the Contractor will submit reports describing progress toward completion of the project tasks. At the end of the project period, the Contractor will summarize findings during the time of the project and submit three reports detailing changes in state laws related to the topics described above. More detailed requirements are given below. Place of Performance/Hours of Operation: Work will take place at the contractor&rsquo;s site. Period of Performance: The period of performance is 24 months from the date of award. Technical Services Required: Legal review and analysis to discover and synthesize changes in the legislative environment related to Medicaid benefits for adults, scope of immunization practice by non-physicians, and vaccination requirements in long-term care facilities. (See tasks 2.1) Tasks: The contractor shall: Task 1: Update report on Medicaid immunization benefits for non-institutionalized adults. Within 12 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will complete data collection as necessary to update the Medicaid report, to include benefits for HPV, zoster, and Tdap vaccines. Data collection will include a survey of state Medicaid directors regarding their future plans for adult immunization benefits and total state expenditures on immunizations for Medicaid beneficiaries. Within 24 months of award, the Contractor will submit the final updated report. CDC may request a preliminary final report for review within 18 months of the award. Task 2: Update report on state laws covering immunization practice by non-physician providers under their own license or via the use of standing orders. Within 12 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will complete data collection as necessary to update the standing orders report, to include medical assistants. Within 24 months of award, the Contractor will submit the final updated report. CDC may request a preliminary final report for review within 18 months of the award. Task 3: Update report on vaccination requirements for staff and residents in long-term care facilities. Within 18 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will complete data collection as necessary to update the long-term care facilities report. Within 24 months of award, the Contractor will submit the final updated report. CDC may request a preliminary final report for review. Task 4: Update &ldquo;Epidemiology of Immunization Law&rdquo; project website. Within 24 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will update the project website at www.gwumc.edu/sphhs/departments/healthpolicy/immunization/index.cfm to include the updated reports described in the previous tasks. The Contractor will also modify existing graphic depictions of project results (i.e. the Standing Orders Project map) to reflect the findings of the current task order. Task 5: Develop manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals. Within 24 months of award of the task order, the Contractor will, in conjunction with CDC scientists, draft and submit to CDC clearance at least one manuscript describing the findings of the above-referenced tasks for submission to a peer-reviewed journal. All publications based on project data will need to be cleared by CDC, even manuscripts drafted or published after the end of the performance period. Specific Task Deliverables: See tasks above. (1) Medicaid immunization benefits report, (2) Scope of immunization practice/standing orders report, (3) Vaccination requirements of long-term care facilities report, (4) Web site, (5) Manuscripts for publication, (6) The Contractor shall bring problems or potential problems affecting performance to the attention of the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) as soon as possible. Verbal reports will be followed up with written reports, as follows: 1. Medicaid immunization benefits report, 1 copy, due within 730 days after date of award, 2. Scope of immunization practice/standing orders report, 1 copy, due within 730 days after date of award, 3. Vaccination requirements of long-term care facilities report, 1 copy, due within 730 days after date of award, 4. Web Site, 1 copy, due within 730 days after date of award, 5. Manuscripts for publication, 1 copy, due within 730 days after date of award, 6. Quarterly Progress Reports, 1 copy, due Quarterly: beginning 90 days after date of award. Delivery Instructions: Deliverables shall be submitted by electronic format in Microsoft Word to the COTR and hard copies sent to CDC by FedEx, UPS or similar carrier. (U.S. postal service does not deliver to the address). Acceptance of Deliverables: The COTR will review the contractor deliverables in accordance with CDC policy and regulations. The COTR will provide in writing a description of all deficiencies to be corrected by the contractor. The corrected deliverables shall be re-submitted within 10 calendar days at no additional cost to the Government. Records/Data. All data and materials produced during the course of this contract are the property the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Security and Privacy: Work on this project requires that personnel have access to Privacy Information. Personnel shall adhere to the Privacy Act, Title 5 of the U.S. Code, Section 552a and applicable agency rules and regulations, and shall agree to adhere to those privacy and security policies and procedures in place within the Contractor&rsquo;s business environment. Government Furnished Items: The Government (CDC) will provide background documents and information necessary for contractor to begin the work. If the work is to be performed primarily off-site at the contractor&rsquo;s locations, where the contractor needs to access CDC&rsquo;s network, the CDC will not provide IT equipment and the computers used by contractor personnel shall meet CDC&rsquo;s standard software and security configuration before logging onto CDC&rsquo;s network. No travel is required. Personnel: The contractor shall identify key personnel in the technical proposal. Familiarity with vaccination laws is a requirement. Vendor will need to be familiar with the methods of the previous legal reviews, the materials of which are in the possession of George Washington University. The primary function of this analysis is to provide a baseline for monitoring changes to state Medicaid programs as the provision of the Affordable Care Act are implemented nationally. However, elements of the ACA relating to Medicaid will come into effect as early as January 2013, so that the review and analysis of current Medicaid programs must be completed as soon as possible before state governments begin to implement changes in anticipation of ACA requirements. CDC&nbsp;has determined&nbsp;that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business and is not a commerical item acquisition.

<DESC>The purpose of this solicitation modification is to post the following answer to the questions received after posting this solicitation in the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO).<br /><br />All Others Terms and Conditions remain unchanged.<br /><br />
<p>1. What network(s) do the applications currently reside:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. NIPRnet for the COLTS interface to SWALIS, but SWALIS is also on the SIPR<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />2. What network will the interfaces need to be located:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. NIPR - SWALIS to/from COLTS<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />3. Is it possible to get access to the document mentioned in 9.0<br />"Presentation of the COLTS Capabilities from NAVAIR" to help with our<br />estimation?&nbsp; <br />a. We will have to get this from NAVAIR or Dean McCoy,</p>
<p>4. Who is responsible for the MOAs, SIAs, and other required technical<br />interface documentation? <br />a. MOAs between NSW and NAVAIR would be done by Dean McCoy.&nbsp; SIAs would be between the N4/N6 and NAVAIR who controls the COLTS program</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who is the incumbent?&nbsp; There is no incumbent for this contract requirement, but Northern Taiga Ventures Incorporated (NTVI) is the current contractor supporting NSW for SWALIS..&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this program being heavily dependent on the IUID markings which<br />are used for HHT scanning into, and out of, the SWALIS system, is this RFP<br />assuming all SWALIS-related activities, or just for the integration between<br />the two systems? This is to accomplish the integration between the systems and requires a high level of expertise and knowledge of the COLTS system/database structure and SWALIS system/structure. The contractor will need a thorough knowledge of the DOD UID system.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has the basic architecture of the Oracle 10g database been<br />established or should this be addressed in the RFP response? Yes the architecture of the database is established.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What security clearances, if any are required? Secret or higher for anyone involved.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must all work be performed on site? No, but a regularly established set of onsite meetings will be required with the COR/COTR and NAVAIR for coordination of requirements and interfaces between the SWALIS and COLTS systems.&nbsp; Installation and testing will happen in San Diego and this will also require work in Paxtuxtet River, MD at the NAVAIR facility.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the anticipated distribution (percentage) among the 4 sites<br />listed as on-site work?&nbsp; No anticipated distribution percentage, contractor needs to present their best effort and explain how their approach will be able to meet the requirement.&nbsp; The use of COLTS will be primarily in&nbsp; San Diego, but the system will be hosted at a NAVAIR facility in a TBD location (probably Paxtuxtet River, MD).&nbsp; System administration is conducted in San Diego at NSW HQ.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the required software packages be furnished, i.e. should any<br />software costs be reflected in the proposal?&nbsp; What software packages are they asking about?&nbsp; COLTS and the existing SWALIS program would be provided, but we will not be providing a license for Oracle (example), all costs would have to reflect any required&nbsp; Oracle software licences needed to accomplish the work</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amendment 0002</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The purpose of this amendment is to:<br /><br />Provide answers to questions submitted by interested parties..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1.) <strong>Questions:</strong> Is the project estimate indicated in the solicitation a typo? If not, what are the Department of Commerce factors when it determines the overall best-value proposed by a contractor as indicated on page 85, Section M.5. Pricing, if the proposal price is above the estimated range?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2.) <strong>Answer:</strong> As stated in FAR Sub Part 36.204, Disclosure of the Magnitude of Construction Projects, "Advance notices and solicitations shall state the magnitude of the requirement in terms of physical characteristics and estimated price range. In no event shall the statement of magnitude disclose the Government's estimate. Therefore, the estimated price should be described in terms of ... price ranges".<br /><br />The estimate is provided to inform the potential offerors of the magnitude of the project. This price range is not a direct factor in the determination whether the prices offered are fair and reasonable, or reflect the best value for the Government.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Award Basis: The Government's evaluation of quotation will fully account for the evaluation factors identified and required under the Addenda to FAR 52.212-1 of 1.) Price and 2.) Technical Qualification 3) Past Performance. The evaluation of these factors will utilize the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) award basis. Quotes that do not meet the quote specifics, will be deemed technically unacceptable, and therefore not considered for award.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges or communications and therefore, quotations should contain the vendor's best terms.</p>
<p>(b) Evaluation: Evaluation factors for price and technical qualification as required under the addendum to 52.212-1 will be evaluated by the Government as follows;</p>
<p>i. Price: To evaluate price reasonableness, a comparison will be made amongst all received quotations and the Government's estimate.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Qualification: A vendor's quotation will be considered technically acceptable if it meets the requirements detailed in paragraph C5 above. Quotations that do not meet these requirements will be considered unacceptable and therefore, under the LPTA evaluation process, will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>iii. Past Performance : Past performance ratings will be evaluated using the list of current/recent and relevant contracts provided by vendors. The result of the assessment will determine if a vendor's past performance on recent and relevant contracts was favorable, or unfavorable. Failure by vendors to submit past performance information, or the inability to accurately reference points of contacts and respective contact numbers, may result not being selected for award.</p>
<p>The evaluation of past performance information will result in an overall assessment of satisfactory or unsatisfactory as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Satisfactory Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort<br />Unsatisfactory Based on the vendor's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p><br />(a) Award Determination: As a result of the Government's aforementioned evaluation, only those vendors whose proposals are determined to be technically acceptable and that have been assigned a satisfactory past performance rating, will be considered for award. Of those vendors found technically acceptable, and assigned satisfactory past performance ratings, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror whose price is determined reasonable and affordable.<br />(b) Options: The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offerer within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not theere are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End Provision)</p>
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations.<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />If you have any questions or concerns, please contact one of the following:<br />Primary point of contact:<br />Contract Specialist: Wendell D.

<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL/Rome Research Sites "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): A Guide for Industry," April 2007, may be accessed at: http://www.fbo.gov/spg/USAF/AFMC/AFRLRRS/Reference%<br />2DNumber%2DBAAGUIDE/listing.html</p>
<p>2. CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION: Offerors are required to submit 3 copies of a 3 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Estimated Cost, Name/Address of Company, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact (phone, fax and email)(this section is NOT included in the page count); Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverables. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, their Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, a fax number, an e-mail address, and reference BAA 09-09-RIKA with their submission.

<p><br />5. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>All responses to this announcement must be addressed to:</p>
<p>AFRL/RIGC<br />ATTN: David Krzysiak<br />525 Brooks Rd<br />Rome, NY 13441</p>
<p>Electronic submission to David.Krzysiak@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.</p>
<p><br />V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge and (3) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: <br />Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.<br />3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for one or more pasture facilities to maintain from 800 - 5,000 wild horses each for one year, with 4 additional one year option periods. The facilities must be located in the Continental United States and provide a free-roaming environment. Based on this Request for Proposal (RFP) the Bureau of Land Management anticipates the award of one or more contracts, each contract having the capacity to maintain 800 - 5,000 wild horses for long term wild horse holding facilities located in the continental United States.  Each contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facilities must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  Once a facility meets the minimum requirements of the EA and the specifications contained herein, BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility.  This is anticipated to occur within 90 calendar days from the date of award.  No payments shall be made until after animals are received at the facilities and have resided at the facility for a full one month period.  Contractor will be reimbursed on a per animal feed day basis for the previous month of service.  No advance payments are authorized. This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation L11PS00651, which will ONLY be available at http://www.fedconnect.net on or about June 20, 2011.

<DESC>This is a modification of a previously announced procurement action. The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region Office, 1150 N Curtis Rd, Boise, ID 83706, will purchase a SEGMENTED CONTINUOUS FLOW ANALYZER SYSTEM as a sole source item for their Water Quality Lab located in Boise. The sole source shall be Seal Analytical, Inc. The PN Regional Lab currently utilizes two Seal brand segmented continuous flow analyzer systems. The lab has a requirement for a third instrument. It has been determined that it would be more cost-effective to acquire another instrument of the same brand and model. This action will save money on training, will utilize the investment in an existing inventory of parts and supplies and will provide for the quick interchangeability of parts and modules should one instrument fail, especially during periods of short lead times or in the case of an emergency. Reduced costs can also be realized by combining scheduled preventative maintenance trips by factory personnel. One service trip will allow for a technician to service 3 instruments. Direct inquiries to Don Anderson by e-mail at dhanderson@usbr.gov or by phone at 208-378-5342.

These Contractors will compete for task orders as road maintenance needs arise. Each contract will have a minimum guarantee of $2,500.00 and the cumulative value of all orders placed against all contracts will not exceed $1.5 million. Contracts will be awarded to the offerors whose submittals, in compliance with the solicitation represent the best value to the government.</p>
<p>The solicitation for this project will be issued on or around May 24, 2011 with offers due on or around June 23, 2011. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government. In accordance with FAR 4.1102(a), prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Lack of registration in the CCR on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov//.<br /><br />For clarification purposes: The attached Amendment 1 (titled Amendment 2 on the SF-30) is the only amendment for this solicitation.</p>
