<SOLNBR>DOL079RP20294
<CONTACT>Jennifer Snook, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-693-4585, Fax 202-693-7290, Email snook.jennifer@dol.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Labor (DOL), Office of the Assistant Secretary of Administration and Management (OASAM), Human Resources Center (HRC), Office of Workforce Planning and e-Innovations anticipates the release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for public/private sector competition for a Shared Service Center to replace existing systems being supported internally.  The Human Resources Line of Business (HR LOB) is one of several E-Government Lines of Business initiatives being implemented under the President's Management Agenda to identify opportunities to reduce the cost of government and improve services to citizens through business performance improvements.  DOL is seeking a service provider to support the Department's human resource and payroll requirements.  The selected provider will provide a comprehensive solution for the replacement of the enterprise systems currently used by DOL.  These systems shall be integrated and provide real-time processing, and real-time availability of departmental data for the approximately 15,500 employee workforce located in over 400 duty locations and serviced by 15 Human Resources Offices.  Additionally, the solution shall support the objectives and requirements defined in the following:


-HR LOB Business Reference Model (BRM) version 2 - January 31, 2006, 

http://www.opm.gov/egov/documents/architecture/


-HR LOB Target Requirements for Shared Service Centers version 1 - November 18, 2005,

http://www.opm.gov/egov/documents/requirements/ .  



The Internal DOL systems of the Shared Service Center include initiation of personnel processing, Human Resources transactional processing, time and attendance, training administration, and analytical reporting.  DOL's selected Shared Service Center will deliver a broad array of HR and back-office services and that allows the Department to leverage economies of scale in delivering administrative functions, to reduce cost and streamline processes and response time, and increase the quality and consistency of service provided.  DOL currently utilizes a highly customized software product as the Department's implementation of the PeopleSoft Human Resources Management System (HRMS) version 7.51 Federal product release.  While this PeoplePower installation is based on the PeopleSoft Federal HRMS product, it is a highly customized application structured and tailored for use by the Department based on their specific HR and financial management processes.  Since DOL currently has a paperless environment with expanded workflow processes, DOL has the expressed intent to continue to support these activities with the selected provider.  The period of performance of the proposed contract is anticipated to encompass a two-year base plus five (5) additional one-year option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Government.     


The solicitation will be available on or after December 4, 2006, and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities web site, http://www.fbo.gov.  Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available.  The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  The estimated closing date for this solicitation will be on or about January 19, 2007.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by this agency.  Please be advised that the official due date and time will be provided in the RFP and that only those responsive proposals received by the Contracting Officer shall be evaluated.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No telephone requests for the solicitation will be accepted.


This is a 100% full and open competition available to both the public and private sector.  The NAICS Code identified for this requirement is 518210, Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services and the size standard is $23 million.  This anticipated RFP solicitation does not commit the Government to award of a contract.  If this solicitation is cancelled, Offerors are cautioned that bid and proposal will not be subject to a claim against the Government, nor shall the Government be held liable for any of these costs.  Award is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds.

GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for an Architectural Engineering Firm
FOR THE J.P. KINNEARY U.S. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE, COLUMBUS, OHIO
Architect Engineer Services Solicitation #GS05P06GBC3010 Columbus, Ohio
Through the preservation and modernization of an historic building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture.  In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented designers and artists to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 to 100 years of service.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values.

In this context, (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural engineering design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including P-100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service).  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals, security requirements, and the requirements of the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards.  

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services are required for the restoration and improvements to the building exterior, for an accessibility entrance and other improvements to the J.P. Kinneary U.S. Courthouse, 85 Marconi Boulevard, Columbus, Ohio 43215.  The 5 story building was constructed in 1934 and contains approximately 318,258 gross square feet with parking.  The design must follow the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Building Preservation Plan (BPP) guidance, respecting the existing historic character of the building while accomplishing the project requirements.   The building houses 165 federal employees from the US Courts, US Attorney, US Marshals and other miscellaneous agencies.  The estimated total construction cost for the project is estimated to range between $8,000,000 and $18,000,000.

PROJECT SCOPE OF WORK:
The major part of the work will consist of masonry restoration.  The sandstone facades are in need of major repairs to remove safety hazards, extend the life of the building and improve its appearance.  The existing windows of the garage skylight are original to the building and in need of replacement.  A Public Accessibility route at the main entrance to the courthouse does not currently exist and must be provided to satisfy the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS).  Other needed improvements include:  Exterior perimeter drainage replacement;  Interior basement drainage repairs;  Roof skylight repairs;  Repair of other entrance stairs, doors and rails;  Improving locations of surveillance  cameras and exterior lighting;  Miscellaneous exterior improvements.  
The scope of Architect/Engineer services required under this proposed contract may include, but are not limited to, the following:  Survey of existing conditions; Detail scope verification;  Presentations for client and historic preservation agencies;  Complete design services including the preparation of construction contract CAD drawings, specifications and cost estimates;   Space layouts;  Interior design;  Shop drawing reviews;  Construction inspection services and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government.  The work will involve all design disciplines including architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical and fire protection.  Throughout the design process, the selected A-E may assist the Government in identifying those elements of work that can be accomplished within the congressionally mandated cost limitation for the project. The construction contract is envisioned to be procured through a source selection process that may incorporate a base contract and options for those elements of work that can be executed within the congressionally mandate cost limitation. Drawings shall be created, formatted, and submitted in a CAD program compatible with GSA’s software standards.. Specifications, reports, databases, and similar items shall also be submitted digitally in software compatible with GSA’s standards. The firm/joint venture shall update software versions at their own expense. The courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Each design submission must be approved by the Regional Historic Preservation Officer, who will coordinate external review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 106.  Design submissions will include a preservation report with captioned photographs and relevant design details identifying preservation design issues and solutions as they are developed.  Every effort will be made to avoid adversely effecting original materials and design in the building’s restoration or preservation zones identified in the Building Preservation Plan.  Alteration or removal of original materials and design requires special justification and a Memorandum of Agreement with the SHPO, documenting concurrence on measures to mitigate all adverse effects to the historic building.

Description:

Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services:

The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services related to the modernization and renovation at the Minton-Capehart Federal Building, located in downtown Indianapolis at 575 North Pennsylvania, Indiana.  Built in 1974, the Minton-Capehart Federal Building is a freestanding six story building with a Ground Floor below grade, with a mechanical mezzanine above grade, and a penthouse above the core area of the Sixth Floor.  Attached to the building is a two level parking facility.  It is the intention in this design and construction renovation project is to respect the Modern Era “Brutalist” Design of the building, even though the building is not yet currently listed on the National Historic Register.  The estimated construction cost ranges is $19 million to $30 million.  The construction portion of the project is estimated to begin in April 2009.

The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes the base contract for Pre-Construction Phase Services with the Construction Phase Services of the project evaluated as a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) option.  This will be a firm, fixed-price contract.  A firm, fixed-price for the general construction services will be negotiated prior to exercising the Construction phase option.

Project Summary:

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, this project will be executed based on GSA’s Design and Construction Excellence Program.  The scope of this project, as it relates to the planned modernization and renovation work will most likely included, but not be limited to, the following:  (1)  refurbish the air-handling units for greater airflow to provide the recommended minimum amount of fresh air for each occupant and improve the total air circulation; (2)  replace the fiberglass branch distribution ductwork and diffusers to handle greater airflows and to eliminate contamination from glass fiber in the environmental air, (3)  replace the stair pressurization fans with larger fans that will produce the necessary pressures and airflows; (4)  provide a new direct digital control (DDC) temperature control system for energy efficiency; (5)  provide additional commissioning of the system and other improvements for LEED-EB certification; (6)  utilize the existing dry standpipe risers in the stairs as a part of a new sprinkler system; (7)  provide sprinkler protection extending from the mains to each space in the building; (8)  provide a new fire pump and jockey pump, installed in the Ground Floor mechanical room, to boost the pressure for the new sprinkler system; as well as (9)  provide new lay-in ceilings, repair hard ceilings and replace lighting throughout the building with modular wiring and automatic controls for lower maintenance costs, easier adds and moves, as well as provide for greater energy efficiency.  Possible additional design work (Option1 1) and additional construction work (part of Option 2) may include the repair of the existing parking garage structure attached to the building, as well as the build out/backfill of anticipated vacant space on the sixth floor for a particular tenant agency.  The entire project will incorporate GSA’s design standards for secure facilities, conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements.

The building will be fully occupied during construction.  All building systems will remain in operation during construction and the project phased to avoid disruption of occupants.  Construction will be accomplished with a combination of after normal business hour work (6pm-6am, weekends, and holidays) and swing space.

Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor:  A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the General Services Administration – GSA).    The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor, the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, during the planning, design, and construction phases of the project.

Selection of the CMc firm will be in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations and source selection procedures using the Best Value Trade-off process. All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations. The CMc shall work with the A/E, their design consultants, the Third Party Commissioning Contractor, and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.  The CMc will be brought onto the project during the design phase, during which he/she can be effective at controlling design-related costs and develop construction sequencing activities.  During the design phase, the CMc will be responsible for developing construction cost estimates and costs related to future project consultants.  For the Pre-Construction Phase Services, GSA intends to have the CMc perform other services including evaluating design concepts, reviewing designs, evaluating cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, reviewing phases of work, resolving problems, participating in value engineering (VE) exercises, preparing commissioning plans as determined by a 3rd party commissioning agent, working with a LEED consultant to prepare for LEED certification, conducting constructability reviews, developing subcontractor and supplier interests, identifying long-lead items, and performing administrative and other services.  The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, delineate necessary actions, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.

CMc services for this project during the actual construction, Construction Phase Services (Option 2), will include, but may not be limited to, the following: administration of the construction contract (whether the work is performed with the CMc’s internal personnel or under sub-contract), coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, record keeping, progress reporting, schedule control, inspections, testing, and other required supplemental LEED services.  The CM shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the project.  During the construction phase, the CMc will be responsible for providing warranties on all completed work and for providing construction materials in a timely manner to complete the job on schedule and under budget.

Small Business Participation:  This is a negotiated procurement open to both large and small business concerns.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31.0 million.  Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small businesses including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, small disadvantaged businesses and service disabled veteran-owned business are strongly encouraged to participate in this project.  In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.

<CONTACT>Gary Harris Contracting Officer 5108171332     gary_harris@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS), Pacific West Regional Office (PWR), 1111 Jackson Street, Suite 700, Oakland, California, 94607, is seeking a qualified firm(s) or organization(s) to provide Multi-Disciplinary Architect-Engineer Design Services under an Indefinite Quantity contract for a variety of projects within National Park Service units at locations primarily throughout the States of California and Nevada, and on a limited basis the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. The lead firm(s) selected for contract award will be Architect-Engineer (A/E) design firm(s) specializing in contemporary architecture. The contract type will be firm fixed-price. The Government may elect, if appropriate, to award a single task order contract or to award multiple task order contracts to one or more sources under this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award contracts, based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference, to the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work. Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued. FAR Part 16 requires that each multiple awardee be given a fair opportunity of consideration for each proposed task order award. In order to provide a fair opportunity and equitable distribution of task orders amongst the awardees, the Contracting Officer will rotate the selection of equally capable awardee based on the location of project, technical capability, capacity, experience, past performance, quality of deliverables, timeliness, and other factors that the Contracting Officer, in the exercise of sound business judgment, believes are relevant to the placement of orders. This solicitation provides for full and open competition and is open to all business concerns, regardless of size. With respect to the production of plans and specifications (Title II design services), the maximum amount that can be paid to an Architect-Engineer (A/E) is 6% of the estimated cost of construction (41 U.S.C. § 254(b)). 1.  TYPES OF PROJECTS - Projects may include, but are not limited to architectural design services with respect to site planning and design, new construction or rehabilitation of NPS Visitor Centers/Interpretive Centers, Administration Facilities, Maintenance Facilities, Marine Facilities, Comfort Stations, Campgrounds, Entrance Stations, Utility Structures and other support structures and amenities constructed at NPS units.  2.  REQUIRED DISCIPLINES - A.  Required disciplines include, but are not limited to professionals registered as Architects, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Fire Protection, and Geotechnical Engineering and Sustainable Technologies. B.  Additional disciplines which may be required for some projects include registered or certified professionals in the following areas:  Surveying, Industrial Hygiene, Construction Management, Cost Control and Cost Estimating, Exhibitry/Media Design, and Value Analysis/Value Engineering. C.  Incidental services, e.g., AutoCAD drafting and 3D modeling, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office Project, Adobe Acrobat, etc., may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements.  D.  Professional registration of Architect-Engineer staff. Active professional registration of Architect-Engineer staff will be required in accordance with FAR 52.236-25. It will not be necessary for prospective firms to hold registrations within all the States that comprise the National Park Service, Pacific West Region (for the purpose of this solicitation, the States of California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana) at the time of submission of the SF-330, but the ability and willingness to obtain registration where it may be needed will be considered in evaluating qualifications. 3.  CONTRACT PERIOD - All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract. The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed-price task orders. The maximum ordering limitation will be $7,500,000.00 for the life of the contract. Each task order will not exceed $250,000.00. The $7,500,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread over the life of the contract including all option years. The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all option exercised, is $50,000.00. 4.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN - The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities. Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. 5.  EXECUTIVE ORDER - In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures. Work performed under this contract may be subject to this requirement. 6.  PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED - For the purposes of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily: A.  Project Planning and Compliance Services; B.  Predesign Services: 1.  Programming, 2.  Site Analysis, 3.  Supplementary Services; C.  Design Services:	1.  Schematic Design, 2.  Value Analysis, 3.  Design Development, 4.  Construction Documents, 5.  Construction Support; D.  Construction Management Services 7.  COORDINATION - The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving  projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes, and policies. 8.  SPECIALIZED SERVICES - In the course of doing business with A/E firms under contract with the NPS, our office occasionally needs to obtain specialized services that may be provided by a subcontractor under the prime contract for A/E services.  Where the majority of work may be performed solely by the sub consultant with little involvement of the prime contractor, NPS does not intend to approve or consent to the prime contractor receiving an administrative handling, coordination or related overhead charge for the sub contractor's services.  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications should take this into consideration. 9.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA - Statements of Qualifications will be evaluated by a selection committee of NPS personnel based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1.	Demonstrated professional qualifications of lead individuals listed to perform under the contract, including individual licenses, certifications, and experience in the similar projects proposed.  Participation of the lead individuals should be highlighted. 2.  Specific past performance on previous architect/engineering work performed for Federal, State, and local government agencies, and institutional entities documenting the quality of the firm's work and the firm's history of meeting performance schedules and budgets on comparable small projects. 3.	Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required under this contract, particularly small rehabilitation projects (NOTE: design services between $10,000 and $50,000). 4.	Ability of the firm to communicate, coordinate, facilitate work expeditiously with the NPS, to participate in related meetings and readily integrate into a multi-disciplinary design team managed through NPS. 5.	Demonstrated capacity to respond to short time frames and accomplish multiple simultaneous projects within desired schedules, while maintaining a high standard of quality work and cost control. 6.  Demonstration of sustainable design ethic, philosophy, and approach and the ability of the team to produce viable design solutions that show an awareness and sensitivity to local natural and cultural resources. This includes to the maximum extent practicable, specifying the use of recycled content material and recovered materials, and providing designs for construction that promote energy conservation, pollution prevention, and waste reduction. 7.	Location in general geographic area of the proposed projects and knowledge of the locality and the associated design and construction considerations of proposed projects. 10.  REQUIRED REGISTRATION - To be eligible for award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) registrar via the CCR Internet site at www.ccr.gov and to have completed the electronic Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. 11.  SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENT - This solicitation provides for full and open competition and is open to all business concerns, regardless of size. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The plan is not required with this submittal. 12.

<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS), Pacific West Regional Office (PWR), 1111 Jackson Street, Suite 700, Oakland, California, 94607, is seeking a qualified firm(s) or organization(s) to provide Multi-Disciplinary Architect-Engineer Design Services under an Indefinite Quantity contract for a variety of projects within National Park Service units at locations primarily throughout the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana and on a limited basis the States of California and Nevada. The lead firm(s) selected for contract award will be Architect-Engineer (A/E) design firm(s) specializing in contemporary architecture. The contract type will be firm fixed-price. The Government may elect, if appropriate, to award a single task order contract or to award multiple task order contracts to one or more sources under this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award contracts, based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference, to the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work. Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued. FAR Part 16 requires that each multiple awardee be given a fair opportunity of consideration for each proposed task order award. In order to provide a fair opportunity and equitable distribution of task orders amongst the awardees, the Contracting Officer will rotate the selection of equally capable awardee based on the location of project, technical capability, capacity, experience, past performance, quality of deliverables, timeliness, and other factors that the Contracting Officer, in the exercise of sound business judgment, believes are relevant to the placement of orders. This solicitation provides for full and open competition and is open to all business concerns, regardless of size. With respect to the production of plans and specifications (Title II design services), the maximum amount that can be paid to an Architect-Engineer (A/E) is 6% of the estimated cost of construction (41 U.S.C. § 254(b)). 1.  TYPES OF PROJECTS - Projects may include, but are not limited to architectural design services with respect to site planning and design, new construction or rehabilitation of NPS Visitor Centers/Interpretive Centers, Administration Facilities, Maintenance Facilities, Marine Facilities, Comfort Stations, Campgrounds, Entrance Stations, Utility Structures and other support structures and amenities constructed at NPS units.  2.

Required disciplines include, but are not limited to professionals registered as Architects, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, Fire Protection, and Geotechnical Engineering and Sustainable Technologies. B.  Additional disciplines which may be required for some projects include registered or certified professionals in the following areas:  Surveying, Industrial Hygiene, Construction Management, Cost Control and Cost Estimating, Exhibitry/Media Design, and Value Analysis/Value Engineering. C.  Incidental services, e.g., AutoCAD drafting and 3D modeling, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office Project, Adobe Acrobat, etc., may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements. D.  Professional registration of Architect-Engineer staff. Active professional registration of Architect-Engineer staff will be required in accordance with FAR 52.236-25. It will not be necessary for prospective firms to hold registrations within all the States that comprise the National Park Service, Pacific West Region (for the purpose of this solicitation, the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, California, and Nevada) at the time of submission of the SF-330, but the ability and willingness to obtain registration where it may be needed will be considered in evaluating qualifications. 3.  CONTRACT PERIOD - All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract. The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed-price task orders. The maximum ordering limitation will be $7,500,000.00 for the life of the contract. Each task order will not exceed $250,000.00. The $7,500,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread over the life of the contract including all option years. The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all option exercised, is $50,000.00. 4.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN - The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities. Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. 5.  EXECUTIVE ORDER - In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures. Work performed under this contract may be subject to this requirement. 6.  PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED - For the purposes of this contract, the services to be provided will be primarily: A.  Project Planning and Compliance Services; B.  Predesign Services: 1. Programming, 2.  Site Analysis, 3.  Supplementary Services; C.  Design Services: 1.  Schematic Design, 2.  Value Analysis, 3.  Design Development, 4.  Construction Documents, 5.  Construction Support; D.  Construction Management Services 7.  COORDINATION - The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving  projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes, and policies. 8.  SPECIALIZED SERVICES - In the course of doing business with A/E firms under contract with the NPS, our office occasionally needs to obtain specialized services that may be provided by a subcontractor under the prime contract for A/E services.  Where the majority of work may be performed solely by the sub consultant with little involvement of the prime contractor, NPS does not intend to approve or consent to the prime contractor receiving an administrative handling, coordination or related overhead charge for the sub contractor's services.  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications should take this into consideration. 9.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA - Statements of Qualifications will be evaluated by a selection committee of NPS personnel based on the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1.  Demonstrated professional qualifications of lead individuals listed to perform under the contract, including individual licenses, certifications, and experience in the similar projects proposed.

The lead firm(s) selected for contract award will be an architecture and engineering firm(s) specializing in historic architecture and historic landscape architecture (including ethnographic landscapes). In order to maximize competition, the NPS is encouraging joint venture arrangements as well as prime/subcontractor relationships for this solicitation.  The contract type will be firm fixed-price. The Government may elect, if appropriate, to award a single task order contract or to award multiple task order contracts to one or more sources under this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award contracts, based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference, to the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work. Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued. FAR Part 16 requires that each multiple awardee be given a fair opportunity of consideration for each proposed task order award. In order to provide a fair opportunity and equitable distribution of task orders amongst the awardees, the Contracting Officer will rotate the selection of equally capable awardee based on the location of project, technical capability, capacity, experience, past performance, quality of deliverables, timeliness, and other factors that the Contracting Officer, in the exercise of sound business judgment, believes are relevant to the placement of orders. This solicitation provides for full and open competition and is open to all business concerns, regardless of size. With respect to the production of plans and specifications (Title II design services), the maximum amount that can be paid to an Architect-Engineer is 6% of the estimated cost of construction (41 U.S.C. § 254(b)). 1.  TYPES OF PROJECTS - Projects may include, but are not limited to research (such as Historic Resource Studies, National Register Nominations, Historic Structures Reports, Cultural Landscape Reports, Paint and Finishes Analysis, Historic Plant Identification); cultural landscape, archeological and historic structure inventories and assessments; resource management plans (such as Vegetation management Plans);  and site planning and design for stabilization, preservation, rehabilitation; and restoration of historic structures and cultural landscapes. 2.  REQUIRED DISCIPLINES - A.  Required disciplines include, but are not limited to professionals registered as Architects, Landscape Architects, Professional Engineers and professionals meeting the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards for Historical Architect, Historical Landscape Architect, Architectural Historian, Landscape Historian, Historian, Architectural Conservator, and Preservation Horticulturalist;  B.  Additional disciplines which may be required for some projects include, but are not limited to, professionals registered in, or meeting the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards for (as appropriate), Archeology, Anthropology, Materials Conservation, Cost Control, Cost Estimating and Sustainable Technologies;  C.  Incidental services, e.g., AutoCAD drafting and 3D modeling, GIS (e.g. ArcGis Desktop), Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office Project, Adobe Acrobat, etc., may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements;  D.  Professional registration of Architect-Engineer staff. Active professional registration of Architect-Engineer staff will be required in accordance with FAR 52.236-25. It will not be necessary for prospective firms to hold registrations within all of the States that comprise the National Park Service, Pacific West Region (for the purposes of this solicitation, the States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, California and Nevada) at the time of submission of the SF-330, but the ability and willingness to obtain registration where it may be needed will be considered in evaluating qualifications. 3.  CONTRACT PERIOD - All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract. The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed-price type task orders. The maximum ordering limitation will be $5,000,000.00 for the life of the contract. Each task order will not exceed $250,000.00. The $5,000,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread over the life of the contract including all option years. The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all option exercised, is $25,000.00. 4.  SUSTAINABLE DESIGN - The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities. Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. 5.  EXECUTIVE ORDER - In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.

Where the majority of work may be performed solely by the sub consultant with little involvement of the prime contractor, NPS does not intend to approve or consent to the prime contractor receiving an administrative handling, coordination or related overhead charge for the sub contractor's services.  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications should take this into consideration. 9.

Period of performance:  Twelve (12) months from date of award.     

The Gatan CCD Cameras and GIF2002 (manufactured by Gatan Inc.) are integral components to the Tecnai series electron microscopes that are manufactured by FEI Company.  Because of the special nature of the CCD technology, these cameras are independently serviced by Gatan Inc. engineers.  The cameras need to be periodically aligned in the FEI electron microscopes and recalibrated with respect to their sensitivity to the electron dose.  There is a complex level of digital access to the electron microscopes and its CCD cameras permitted only to the qualified Gatan engineers.  

Gatan Inc. shall provide: 1) not less than one (1) preventive maintenance inspection; 2) unlimited emergency repair within twenty four (24) hours of first call; 3) furnish all required replacement parts with the exception of consumable parts at no additional cost to the Government; and 4) provide free software upgrades. Contractor personnel shall have a minimum of two (2) years specialized factory training within the last five (5) years in order to perform service to these instruments.  Contractor shall provide current software updates to the operating system and shall provide Gatan Inc. manufactured parts and accessories if required during service.

It is critical to the NCI mission that only Gatan Inc. service engineers provide service to these sensitive cameras.  The engineers are trained in all aspects of the electron microscope CCD cameras and are the only authorized engineers qualified to perform the service duties.   The warranty of the electron microscope and CCD cameras is only guaranteed if serviced by these qualified engineers.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on December 4, 2006.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-70011-NG on all correspondence.

<CONTACT>Erin Durand 703-432-4156
<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.   The Marine Corps Systems Command is conducting a survey of potential sources for Combat Identification Panels (CIP) Kits.  The request is for kits that consist of Combat Identification Panels, Thermal Identification Panels (TIP), and InfraRed (IR) beacons.   The objective of the kits is to mitigate the risk of fratricide for deployed troops and work in tangent with current approved-for-joint-service programs in place.  The CIPs should be configured to attach to specific tactical vehicles and be covered with U.S. Army-approved low-emissivity thermal tape on one side so that when viewed through Thermal Imaging System sensors, the panels appear as contrasting cold spots on a hot target image.  The TIPs should work in much the same way as the CIPs, but when placed on the top of tactical vehicles, should be visible by aircraft.   Each set of panels should be clearly observable and distinguishable by friendly forces at ranges extending to 1,000 meters.  The IR beacons should also provide the means to positively identify the user as a friendly entity to personnel equipped with image intensifying systems.  In order to work with current systems in use, the beacons should operate at a “flicker rate” of one flash every 1.3 seconds and have!   a minimum visibility range of 5 miles.  MARCORSYSCOM anticipates a need for kits specifically configured for the following tactical vehicles: ABV (Assault Breaching Vehicle), LAV-25 (Light Armored Vehicle, 25MM Variant), LAV-L (Logistics Variant), LAV-M/CC/R (Mortar/ Command and Control/ Recovery Variants), MEWS (Mobile Electronic Warfare System), M1123 (High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), Cargo Variant), M1043 (HMMWV, Armament Carrier Variant), M1045 (HMMWV, TOW Carrier Variant), MK23 (Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement, Cargo Truck Variant), M998 (AN/MRC-145, 2 Door C2 Platform), M998 (AN/MRC-148, 2-Door C2 Platform), M1097 (Advanced Man-Portable Air Defense System, 4-Door Cargo Variant), M-1165, M-1152, and M-1151 (HMMWV, Expanded Capacity Vehicle variants).   MARCORSYSCOM will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the requested information.  Industry firms capable of providing the required kits, in whole, are invited to submit a response to this notice.  Firms should include literature, brochures, price lists, estimated production capacity, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.  At a minimum, the capabilities summary should include the following: system description, system maturity, dimensions, power requirements, and any required interfaces.  Firms should also identify/submit a copy of their GSA schedule, if applicable.  Interested firms are requested to respond NLT 4 December 2006, stating their business size, NAICS Code, and identifying a corporate point of contact. Interested sources should respond to: (U. S. Mail address) Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN CT/ MC2I-Erin Durand, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico,!   VA 22134 or electronically via e-mail: erin.durand@usmc.mil.

Its mission is to provide a valuable impact on human health through scientific discovery and translation of the basic research to cancer prevention and treatment.  Its goal is to become a premier cancer research center that pioneers novel approaches to translation and clinical research through its basic research strengths.  The center provides a unique opportunity to achieve this goal and provide training in basic and applied research.  The major goal of this project is to extend the research capabilities of the NCI.  Advanced micro-array technologies have made a profound impact in the pharmaceutical and biomedical worlds and are critical to experiments of genomic profiling and genotype analysis on the genes of human, mouse, yeast, and other organisms.  Affymetrix high-density probe arrays offer information densities as high as 6,500,000 unique features per chip, approximately 20 times more than other platforms. The Affymetrix GeneChip arrays have been used in hundreds of NCI experiments and continue to be used by NCI as well as several other Institutes.  The GeneChip probe arrays manufactured by Affymetrix are compatible only with their equipment.  No other manufacturers' equipment will work with the Affymetrix probe arrays which are proprietary to Affymetrix.  There are 23 Affymetrix scanner systems being used throughout the NIH and 11 of these are being used by the NCI. The use of the Affymetrix probe array by NCI is critical to the ongoing research and experiments.  Any change to the probe arrays currently in use will result in additional variables in all experiments.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Northern Region Contracting Center (NRCC) is seeking small businesses that can provide the Army with contract-supported configuration control, engineering development, and integration general support capability operating across the Battle Laborat ory Collaborative Simulation Environment (BLCSE), rather than being tied to specific BLCSE Battle Lab locations.  The Government's goal is to divide within two parallel efforts.  At designated Centers of Excellent (initially Ft. Benning, Ft. Monroe, Ft. Bl iss, and Ft. Leavenworth), a Technical Integration and Configuration Control (TICC) team will be established with office and work space within a BLCSE portal or hosting battle lab.  These teams are responsible for: operation of local BLCSE network portals (data and VTC); configuration control of assigned BLCSE federates IAW published BLCSE policies and procedures; communication of data and models, as well as federate software packages between various BLCSE locations; providing local single-point-of-referenc e advice and expertise on various BLCSE federates explicitly including OOS and OOS-based tools; and coordination with other TICC and engineering support team efforts in the integration of new federates, data bases, functionalities and capabilities to the l ocal simulation facility.  In addition to the TICC, a centrally controlled BLCSE Engineering Support Team (BEST) will provide detailed engineering work as direct support temporary augmentation to specified government facilities (normally BLCSE battle lab l ocations), or general support to BLCSE federation software or experimentation needs.  The BEST will work with the various battle labs as well as other contract activities to change, transition or evolve BLCSE federates, scenarios, data bases and non-federa tion simulations and tools in support of specific experimentation activities or BLCSE federation evolution.  Other than temporary on-site direct support accommodation, no government facilities will be provided to the BEST except for temporary access to sec ure network facilities when required for data and software transmission or integration of classified simulation databases. The designated NAIC Code is 541512, Computer Systems Integration Analysis and Design Services ($23M). Your response shall include the  following information: size of company (i.e. 8(a), Hubzone, WOSB, SB, Veteran, all others), your total revenue for the last three years, past performance on similar work dating back 5 years, your companys capability and innovative idea to do this type of  work.  Documentation of technical expertise and capability must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.  The info rmation should be sent to NRCC by 27 November 11 August 2006,  ATTN:  Ms. Lois Green, 2798 Harrison Loop Complex, Fort Eustis, VA  23604-5538 or by e-mail at lois.green@eustis.army.mil.

If the sample projects submitted under the firms past experience are also done by the lead Designer clearly state the lead Designers duties, role and responsibilities on each project. If the projects submitted under the lead designer’s portfolio are the same as in the firm’s portfolio then just the Lead Designer role needs to be defined, duplicating the entire portfolio is not necessary.  You may submit as many projects as allowed (5 projects for the firms experience and 3 for the Lead Designer).
 
2.      Question - Related to Stage I:  (3) Lead Designer Portfolio – please explain intent of adding the words “and rehabilitation” to end of second sentence.  Does it mean rehabilitation or renovation of building without historic description?

Response - There is no special intent or meaning, a variety of work showing restoration, conservation, rehabilitation would be the best.
 
3.      Question - If the Lead Designer is a principal of the firm and solely responsible for the design of a project, may that project be listed in both (1) Past Performance on Design and (3) Lead Designer’s Portfolio?  If listed in both sections will scoring points be down graded?

Response - See answer to #1. Yes you may duplicate projects but the principal must have truly acted as the Lead Designer.  

4.      Question - If a project is a new building that demonstrates design skill in blending new construction with adjacent historic structures, will scoring points be down graded because project is not renovation?

Response - All design talent and creativity will be evaluated, but it is easier to demonstrate design talent using projects of similar scope and complexity to this project.  We can not tell you what projects to submit but showing projects of similar or larger size and complexity shows the widest variety of design talent.    

5.      Question - If a project is a new U.S. Courthouse in a historic district that demonstrates skill in meeting GSA P-100, PBS Standards, ABAAS, understanding of court design standards and sensitive design relationships with adjacent historic structures, will scoring points be down graded because project is not renovation? 

Response - See above discussion.

June 5, 2006 (Questions)

1.      Question - Under Stage I description, please explain intent where it says to include “credentials of historic preservation specialist per requirements . . . .” 

Response - We would like to know who will be acting as the historic preservation specialist.  If that role is being filled by the Lead designer then state that.
  
2.      Question - Does the Stage I Design Firm and/or the Lead Designer need to be a GSA approved Historic Preservation Specialist or is it satisfactory for the Stage II Team to have those Speci

The entire project will incorporate GSA’s design standards for secure facilities, conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements.

The building will be fully occupied during construction.  All building systems will remain in operation during construction and the project phased to avoid disruption of occupants.  Construction will be accomplished with a combination of after normal business hour work (6pm-6am, weekends, and holidays) and swing space.

Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor:  A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the General Services Administration – GSA).    The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor, the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, during the planning, design, and construction phases of the project.

Selection of the CMc firm will be in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations and source selection procedures using the Best Value Trade-off process. All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations. The CMc shall work with the A/E, their design consultants, the Third Party Commissioning Contractor, and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.  The CMc will be brought onto the project during the design phase, during which he/she can be effective at controlling design-related costs and develop construction sequencing activities.  During the design phase, the CMc will be responsible for developing construction cost estimates and costs related to future project consultants.  For the Pre-Construction Phase Services, GSA intends to have the CMc perform other services including evaluating design concepts, reviewing designs, evaluating cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, reviewing phases of work, resolving problems, participating in value engineering (VE) exercises, preparing commissioning plans as determined by a 3rd party commissioning agent, working with a LEED consultant to prepare for LEED certification, conducting constructability reviews, developing subcontractor and supplier interests, identifying long-lead items, and performing administrative and other services.  The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, delineate necessary actions, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.

CMc services for this project during the actual construction, Construction Phase Services (Option 2), will include, but may not be limited to, the following: administration of the construction contract (whether the work is performed with the CMc’s internal personnel or under sub-contract), coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, record keeping, progress reporting, schedule control, inspections, testing, and other required supplemental LEED services.  The CM shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the project.  During the construction phase, the CMc will be responsible for providing warranties on all completed work and for providing construction materials in a timely manner to complete the job on schedule and under budget.

Small Business Participation:  This is a negotiated procurement open to both large and small business concerns.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31.0 million.  Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small businesses including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, small disadvantaged businesses and service disabled veteran-owned business are strongly encouraged to participate in this project.  In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  However, all firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local business participation.  In order to receive the benefit of a price evaluation preference as a HUBZone small business concern, firms must be certified by the SBA.  Please refer to the SBA website at www.sba.gov for details. 

Joint Ventures:  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality CMc team effort.

<CONTACT>Carl V. Bradshaw, Contracting Officer (703) 432-4825 Jeff Young, Project Officer  (703) 432-3154
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Manager for Ammunition, Quantico, VA, intends to award a Sole Source ID/IQ Contract with Options to SNC Technologies Inc. (SNC TEC), Le Gardeur, PQ Canada for the following commercial off-the-shelf, non-developmental items: 1) Cartridge, 9mm FX Blue Marking (DODIC: AA21)  Item Description: The Cartridge, 9mm FX Blue Marking (DODIC AA21) is utilized with the M16A2, M4A1 Carbine, Sig Sauer P226 Pistol, M9, and the MP5 Submachine Gun when the weapon is modified with the M9 Special Effects Small Arms Marking System (SESAMS) Adapter Kit. Weapons fitted with the training adapters will operate semi or full automatic simulating live fire.  2) Cartridge, 9mm FX Red Marking (DODIC: AA12)  Item Description: The Cartridge, 9mm FX Red Marking (DODIC AA12) is utilized with the M16A2, M4A1 Carbine, Sig Sauer P226 Pistol, M9, and the MP5 Submachine Gun when the weapon is modified with the M9 Special Effects Small Arms Marking System (SESAMS) Adapter Kit. Weapons fitted with the training adapters will operate semi or full automatic simulating live fire.  The intended use for these cartridges is to provide enhanced training by allowing force-on-force training versus firing at silhouette on impact. When the round impacts a target, the plastic projectile sheath breaks and detergent marks the target, thus indicating a hit.

<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information.  All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and neither constitutes a RFP, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the 329th Armament Systems Group to determine potential sources capable of providing a Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS) for DoD Ranges.  Potential sources should include their size status for NAICS code 334511.  CRIIS will provide enhanced time, space, position information (TSPI) accuracy and selected participant data bus information for test and training event participants, incorporating an advanced spectrally efficient data link.  CRIIS will be developed consistent with an overall goal of maximizing commonality among range instrumentation systems for test and evaluation and training applications.  Development will be funded through the Central Test and Evaluation Investment Program (CTEIP), with follow-on production funded by the individual Services.  

CRIIS development will significantly improve the T&E range capabilities in 5 major areas:  (1) Enhanced data transfer flexibility; (2) Increased TSPI accuracy at faster rates; (3) Component miniaturization and modularity for internal mounting flexibility; (4) Standardization of interface protocols and an open architecture design, to support replacement of future components resulting from obsolescence and changes in technology; and (5) Enhanced system encryption capability.

The test requirements are well established at this time (see Attachment #2). The top level training requirements are: (1) operation on different frequencies; (2) accommodating a different waveform; (3) accommodating Multiple Levels of Security (MLS); (4) accommodating detached clusters; and (5) accommodating burst mode transmissions.

Potential offerors should deliver a Statement of Capabilities in accordance with Numbered Note 25, specifically addressing your area(s) of expertise and whether your company would be interested in being a prime contractor or subcontractor for this effort.  Discuss your experience in designing, developing, fabricating, testing and maintaining similar systems.  If interested in being a prime, discuss your company?s experience in accomplishing complex system architecture definition, design, and development. Your response must include sufficient backup data to support your answers and/or recommendations in order to conduct meaningful exchanges.  In addition, offerors are requested to comment on questions contained in attached document titled "Questions for Responders" (see Attachment #1).

An industry day, with one-on-one discussions, is anticipated in the near future.  Until such time, questions and/or comments should be submitted to the following e-mail address:  329arsg.criis@eglin.af.mil.  An answer will be provided by return e-mail and all questions and answers will be posted on the FedBizOpps site.  It is the responsibility of industry to monitor www.fedbizopps.gov for the release of any follow-on information.  

Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis.  The Government requests interested offerors submit one (1) copy of their capability response no later than 4:00 p.m., Central Daylight Time, on
18 December 2006.  Statement of Capability should not exceed ten (10) one-sided 8.5 X 11 inch pages, with a font no smaller than 10 point, to the following address:  329 ARSG/PK, Attn:  Edward Miller, 102 West D Avenue, Bldg 11, Eglin AFB, FL  32542-6808.

<RESPDATE>120406
<CONTACT>Phyllis Townsley, 405-954-7816
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Industrial Support Services for the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  Raytheon Support Services Company is currently performing these services.  These services are comprised of several disciplines or job skills, including paint preparation and finishing, metal processing, cabinet making and plastic/fiberglass molding.  Although they appear to be very generic job titles, the majority of the actual day-to-day work assignments are unique to the FAA with its many items of noncommercial equipment.  The timely processing of these assignments is vital to the safe and efficient operation of the National Airspace System (NAS).  The contractor's work and responsibilities shall include all planning, programming, administration and management necessary to provide these services.  Requirements are further defined in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). The contract will be for a 1-year base period with four 1-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  The contract type will be Firm-Fixed-Price.   North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811213, Communication Equipment Repair and Maintenance - $6.5/million. This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves a Request for Qualifications/SIR 1.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this Request for Qualifications/SIR 1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.  The remaining phase(s) of the downselect process will be identified in future communications with those firms that successfully respond to this Request for Qualifications/SIR 1.   Companies that are interested and possess certain special standards of responsibility are to provide specific information as to the unique capabilities to be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific information provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to determine each vendor's eligibility to participate.  Documentation must be provided to substantiate any statement of fact that goes to the vendor's eligibility pursuant to this Request for Qualifications/SIR 1.  The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 10 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION:  FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility. SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.   (Note: Each submission will be evaluated on an "acceptable/unacceptable" basis.  Where a submission is found to be unacceptable in any area of a special standard of responsibility, the entire submission will be considered unacceptable.) 1.  Past Performance and Experience: (Note: Past performance represents "how well" an offeror accomplished the effort.  Experience simply means an offeror has "done it."  Of additional importance is that past performance and experience must be current and relevant as well as comparable in scope and magnitude to that described in the SOW.) 	(a) In order to be determined acceptable vendors must have a minimum of five (5) years experience in performing Industrial Support Services as identified in the attached PWS.  Vendors shall provide a list of relevant past and present contracts performed for Federal, State, or Local Governments or commercial sources within the past five (5) years involving effort of same or similar complexity, magnitude, and level.  The vendor's documented experience shall consist of a list of contracts containing the following information: (i)	Contract number and contract type (ii)	Contracting agency or business (e.g., DOD, FAA, NASA, any Federal agency, State of Oklahoma, etc.) (iii)	Original contract dollar value and final contract dollar value (including options) (iv)	A brief description of the contract effort (v)	Largest number of employees associated with direct contract effort (vi)	Name, address, telephone, FAX numbers, and e:mail address for the Government Contracting Officer(s); for non-government contracts, provide the name, address, telephone and FAX numbers of business point of contact, liaison, etc. 	(b) Where inquiries made pursuant to (a)(vi) reveal the vendor's performance was unsatisfactory (e.g., terminated for default {partial or complete}, cure notice(s) issued, adverse administrative findings by government agencies at the federal, state or local level, etc.), the vendor will no longer be eligible to continue in the SIR process. 2.  Organizational Management and Staffing: Vendors must demonstrate that an on-site Contract Manager will be available at the time of contract award.  Qualifications of the Contract Manager are identified in PWS, paragraph 1.6.1.1, Contract Manager.  The Contract Manager shall have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration or a business related field from an accredited university or college and have a minimum of two years experience in managing Safety (OSHA) and Environmental programs.  Experience must be comparable to the fabrication and repair facilities of the FAA Logistic Support Facility to include painting, metal finishing, plastic/fiberglass, and woodworking skills.  The Contract Manager must have the authority to act on behalf of the contractor and shall have final responsibility for the Contractor's performance.  Vendors must provide a resume for the Contract Manager.  The resume must include the individual's qualifications and work experience.  Resume must include present position or title, experience in managing contracts for services of similar scope and size (include duration or length of all experience, from mo/yr to mo/yr), and educational/training background, in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and management competence. A copy of the current contract and modifications, (DTFA-02-02-D-00313), can be downloaded from the AMQ Internet at http://amq.mmac.faa.gov/FOIA.asp  Interested firms that can comply with and meet the special standards of responsibility addressed in this Request for Qualifications/SIR 1 should respond with their documentation in writing to:  Federal Aviation Administration Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center NAS Contracting Division Attn:  AMQ-210/Phyllis Townsley Room 321, Multi-Purpose Building 6500 South MacArthur Blvd. P.O.

Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined unacceptable; therefore, not considered as one of the qualified companies.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary.

<DESC>Potential Sources Sought. This is not a RFP.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources who can conduct research on the use of recycled materials in the construction and maintenance of roadways and operate the Recycled Materials Resource Center (RMRC).  FHWA is contemplating a competition for a cooperative agreement award to perform the subject project. The subject project is currently being performed under cooperative agreement, which expires in May 2007, with the University of New Hampshire (see www.rmrc.unh.edu). The objectives of the RMRC are to: (1) Systematically test, evaluate, develop appropriate guidelines for, and demonstrate environmentally acceptable and occupationally safe technologies and techniques for the increased use of traditional and nontraditional recycled and secondary materials in transportation infrastructure construction and maintenance; (2) Make information available to State transportation departments, the FHWA, the construction industry, and other interested parties to assist in evaluating proposals to use traditional and nontraditional recycled and secondary materials in transportation infrastructure construction; (3) Encourage the increased use of traditional and nontraditional recycled and secondary materials by using sound science to analyze thoroughly all potential long-term considerations that effect the physical and environmental performance of the materials; (4) Work cooperatively with Federal and State officials to reduce the institutional barriers that limit widespread use of traditional and nontraditional recycled and secondary materials and to ensure that such increased use is consistent with the sustained environmental and physical integrity of the infrastructure in which the materials are used. The estimated period of performance for the project is four years.  Please see the draft Statement of Work provided as an attachment to this Sources Sought notice. FUNDING: FHWA anticipates that Federal funding available for this project will range from $500,000 to $1,100,000 per year for four years. Additionally, FHWA anticipates a required cost share under this cooperative agreement of $500,000 per year for four years. The cost share requirement can be met through direct financial contribution or through ?in-kind? services donated by the prime recipient or by a third party. RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE: Any interested organizations are invited to submit a response to this notice by email to Lise.Lyles@DOT.gov, or in writing to Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management (Attn: Ms. Lise Lyles, HAAM 40-F), Room 4410, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington DC 20590.  Submittals are due by COB December 8, 2006. Submittals shall clearly identify the interested organization, provide a brief technical capability statement, provide any comments/questions on the draft Statement of Work, and must provide preliminary, possible methods/ideas for fulfilling the required cost share requirement, including any concerns regarding the cost share requirement. Note: Preliminary, possible methods/ideas for fulfilling the required cost share requirement are not considered binding and are provided by the responder to FHWA for informational purposes only. For questions concerning this announcement contact Ms. Lyles at 202-366-4229.  This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award an agreement nor does the government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this solicitation.  FHWA anticipates releasing a competitive solicitation for this project on or about December 15, 2006 at www.grants.gov under solicitation/opportunity number DTFH61-07-RA-00102. Interested parties are encouraged to monitor www.grants.gov for release of the solicitation.

Colorimetric Trace EDE are lightweight kits or devices consisting of reagents that will react with explosive residues to provide a color change. Additional Trace EDE are not considered Desktop, Handheld, Colorimetric or Portal trace EDE, due to its unique operational usage of the system. These systems analyze specific target sites such as fingertips, passports, boarding passes, etc. This market survey solicits vendors' information that fully explains their existing technology features, capabili!  ties, and performance. This announcement does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, to procure equipment or services. A solicitation is not planned at this time. This announcement is only an expression of interest. Future requirements and procurements are uncertain. BACKGROUND: NAVEODTECHDIV plans to select EDE systems for three separate comparative tests and evaluations: Handheld, Colorimetric, and Additional. Three reports will be written and made available for use by Government agencies and all the services. IED detection technologies are sought that protect the forces and prevent terrorist bombings against military personnel, equipment and military installations by finding them at points of entry. Ideally, these technologies will allow antiterrorist/force protection / physical security personnel to find IEDs effectively and reliably, while inspecting mail, parcels, cargo, vehicles, and personnel (including personal articles carried by personnel) at military!   installations' entry points without slowing throughput. Our intent is  to test technologically mature and market ready equipment. Currently we plan to test and evaluate up to eight systems in each of the three categories: Handheld, Colorimetric and Additional. A demonstration of technical maturity may be required to support final determinations. Interested firms are encouraged to respond by providing their company name, points of contact, a technical description of their EDE in five or fewer pages, and b) one Quad Chart for each model (only one version per model). An example of a Quad Chart is provided as an attachment to this announcement. REQUIRED INFORMATION: 1.0 General Information. 1.1 Vendor Information - Name, address, point of contact, email and postal address, telephone number, and related WebPages, if applicable. 1.2 System - EDE name and model. Include category responding to (Handheld, Colorimetric, or Additional) 1.3 Function - Objects of interest that EDE can inspect for the explosives in IEDs (for example, mail, small parcels, an!  d personal articles carried by personnel). 1.4 System Picture - Two photographs of EDE: a) oblique color photograph of instrument alone with key non-consumable accessories that will enable viewer to understand relative dimensions in inches, and b) action photograph of EDE inspecting objects of interest for IEDs. 1.5 Technology - A brief description of the technology used by this product consisting of the technology title and five or fewer descriptive sentences. 1.6 Output - Samples of output produced directly by the EDE while in operation that identifies the explosives present in the IED in the object of interest. Examples of output include images of graphical/tabular data of chemical composition. 2.0 Performance Parameters for EDE - The following Performance Parameters measure EDE performance in inspecting representative IEDs at the point of entry onto military installations under typical Point of Entry operational and environmental conditions. 2.1 Detection Effectiveness !  - measured as a percentage, consists of the number of successful IED d etections compared to the number of objects of interest inspected. 2.1.1 Successful Detections - include: a) True Positives - EDE determines the presence of explosives in IEDs. b) True Negatives - EDE determines that explosives are not present when explosives are not present. 2.1.2 Unsuccessful Detections - include: a) False Positives - EDE determines that there are explosives present when explosives are NOT present, and b) False Negatives - EDE determines that there are no explosives present when explosives ARE present. 2.1.3 IED may include the following explosives: ANFO, RDX/C4, TNT, PETN, Semtex, Chlorates, Water Gels, Black Powders, Smokeless Powders, Perchlorates, Peroxides and Dynamites. 2.2 Detection Speed - measured in objects of interest per hour, is the number of objects of interest (mail, parcels, pallets of cargo, persons, or vehicles) that can be fully inspected per hour, once the EDE is operational. Inspecting time is defined as the minimum time interval possi!  ble between the start of an object of interest and the start of the succeeding object of interest at the point of entry, e.g., total time for inspector to collect samples from vehicle at inspection point, and the subsequent collection and analysis at the guard house. EDE preparation and analysis time for that object of interest (excluding initial EDE operation time, self-checks, etc.) 2.3 Ease of Use - is a subjective evaluation based on the responses of an operator survey, which assess the level of difficulty of operation.  2.4 Transportability/Portability consists of two functions - transport of the main component of the EDE to the Point of Entry administrative facility, and the physical movement of the EDE to allow analysis by the main component of the EDE. This requirement will be assessed in terms of the time, manpower and situational needs of operators manning the Point of Entry. 2.5 Reliability - is measured by the degree that the EDE will complete the EDE mission wi!  thout an operational mission failure for all objects requiring screeni ng. Inability of EDE to indicate the presence of an explosive constitutes an operational mission failure. 2.6 Maintainability (Mean Time Between Maintenance) - measured in hours, is the duration of time that, on average the EDE will function as designed without maintenance beyond actions that can be performed by the operator with a prescribed list of spare parts and/or consumable supplies. 3.0 Standard Conditions and Threat - These standard conditions and representative IEDs are intended to provide a common basis for comparing each of the EDE features, capabilities, and performance against user-defined requirements. 3.1 Representative IEDs - shall be used as objects of interest that contain typical explosives that might convey through the Point of Entry. The IEDs shall consist of various explosives that might be contained in or on mail, small parcels, personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves. 3.2 Typical Operational Scenario - EDE will be used to non-!  intrusively inspect mail, small parcels, personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves that might convey through the Point of Entry. 3.3 Typical Environmental Conditions - The Point of Entry will have standard U.S. electrical power supply of 110V AC / 220V AC @ 50-60 Hz. Ambient weather/climatic conditions are expected to: a) range from 0 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, b) range from 10 to 95% humidity, c) barometric pressure ranges from sea level to 3000 feet above sea level, and d) may contain saltwater spray, dust, rain, or snow. 3.4 Typical Operator Abilities -The operator is: a) a soldier, sailor, airman, marine or security personnel, b) supplied with vendor's written manuals, and c) trained by the manufacturer on the proper operation of the equipment. 4.0 System Description and Characteristics - 4.1 Size - Outside dimensions in feet and inches. Weight of each component in pounds. 4.2 Limitations / Hazards / Special Requirements - State any special EDE li!  mitations, hazards and/or special requirements beyond conditions state d herein to include hazards, such as radiation sources or toxic chemicals.  Include a copy of radioactive material license documentation from Nuclear Regulatory Commission, if applicable. 4.3 Special Features/Capabilities - Summarize any special EDE features or capabilities not contained herein that improve the overall ability of the EDE to find IEDs. State whether EDE has ability to detect other classes of chemical compounds or other distinguishing characteristics unique to an IED beyond those cited here.  5.0 Validated Test Results - Summary of vendor and/or third party certifications and/or documented results of vendor test targets, testing and test protocols (additional published technical documentation may be submitted separately).  DEFINITIONS: Desktop EDE - Explosive Detection Equipment whose main component is transportable, but will predominantly reside and be used in the immediate vicinity (within 60 second walk) of the point of inspection. Portal Trace EDE are made!   specifically to detect particles of explosives on personnel as they walk through the system. Typically large and require installation at a fixed site. Handheld Trace EDE are lightweight, battery powered systems that are easy to operate. The systems are taken to the site of the sample to determine if explosives are present. Colorimetric Trace EDE are lightweight kits or devices consisting of reagents that will react with explosive residues and provide a color change. Additional Trace EDE are not labeled Desktop, Handheld, Colorimetric or Portal trace EDE, due to its unique operational usage of the system. These systems analyze specific target sites such as fingertips, passports, boarding passes, etc. Explosive Detection Equipment - devices that determine the presence of characteristics of energetics/explosive materials. False Alarm Rate - the probability that an EDE classifies the object of interest as an explosive when no explosives are present. Improvised Explosive Device!  s - an expediently packaged explosive charge detonated by an initiator  with a customized fuzing and firing circuit, also known as a bomb. Objects of Interest - the subject matter of attention, for example, mail, small parcels, personal articles carried on personnel, and personnel themselves.  Performance Parameter - capabilities required for successful mission accomplishment. Point of Entry - the passageway through a protected perimeter through which all personnel, mail, cargo, and vehicles pass.

MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL THERAPIES AND DIAGNOSTICS 
FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS B

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks collaborations with industry to provide novel therapeutic agents, diagnostic markers and devices for studies of patients with well-characterized chronic hepatitis B.

INTRODUCTION:  Chronic hepatitis B is due a persistent infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is a major cause of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.  Chronic infection with HBV affects an estimated 1.5 million Americans and it is the underlying reason for approximately 10 percent of liver transplants done in the United States.  There are currently six different agents licensed and approved for use as therapeutic agents in patients with chronic hepatitis B.  However, there remain many questions regarding the use of these agents such as:  Which patients with chronic hepatitis B should be treated?  Which agent or agents are most efficacious?  Should agents be used alone or in combination with other therapies?  For how long should the agents be used?  What viral, biochemical or clinical markers should be used to monitor success or failure of therapy?  Currently available therapies are effective for the treatment of patients with advanced disease due to hepatitis B, however it is not clear whether these therapies effect the long-term natural history of mild and moderate forms of chronic HBV infection.  A large proportion of patients with chronic HBV infection have no symptoms or signs of liver disease and have minimal disease activity as assessed by biochemical and histological features; it is not clear whether these patients would benefit from treatment.  At present, the criteria for treatment of hepatitis B are controversial.  

In response to the challenges surrounding management of chronic hepatitis B, the NIDDK has proposed creation of a Hepatitis B Clinical Research Network (Hepatitis B Network) to create a large database of patients with chronic HBV infection and allow for clinical investigation into the pathogenesis of liver injury, the natural history of infection and long-term antiviral therapy in different categories of patients.  This study would include patients with the full spectrum of clinical severity of disease, from patients with the inactive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier state, to patients with mild but active HBV infection (?immune tolerant?), to patients with typical hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive chronic hepatitis B as well as negative chronic hepatitis B (HBeAg), and patients with cirrhosis.  The Hepatitis B Network will be charged with conducting investigational, natural history as well as therapeutic studies and ancillary studies of etiology and pathogenesis. 

The proposed Hepatitis B Network will include up to 10 Clinical Centers in North America which will be charged with enrolling at least 1,000 patients over a 7 year period.  A central data coordinating center will maintain the database and be responsible for the quality and accuracy of the data and adherence to regulatory requirements.  The Hepatitis B Network will include a virology and immunology center which will be charged with testing serum and tissue samples for HBV DNA and assessing the replicative status of HBV in the liver and immune reactivity to HBV antigens in the peripheral blood and intra-hepatic lymphocytes of enrolled patients.  In addition to collecting clinical patient data, the Hepatitis B Network will submit liver biopsy, serum, DNA and other samples to a central repository.  These resources will allow for many ancillary studies on the natural history, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of hepatitis B and will provide multiple opportunities for collaboration with industry in areas such as genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, imaging, and biomarkers for disease activity and hepatic fibrosis, the determinants of progression and severity of chronic hepatitis B.  The Hepatitis B Network will also be charged with developing prospective controlled trials to evaluate important issues in treatment, such as (but not limited to) the role of combination versus monotherapy using nucleoside analogues and the role of peginterferon in the management of HBeAg-positive and -negative chronic hepatitis B.  


STUDY GOALS:  In preparing to establish a Hepatitis B Clinical Research Network, the NIDDK wishes to consider the potential application of diagnostics and therapeutics for patients with chronic hepatitis B.  The overall goal of the Hepatitis B Network will be to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with chronic hepatitis B using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of chronic hepatitis B and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a database on chronic hepatitis B patients including clinical information as well as liver, serum and DNA samples.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies that are interested in collaborating with a proposed Hepatitis B Clinical Research Network by providing novel therapeutic agents, diagnostic markers or devices for investigational studies as well as randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials of approaches to therapy, which could include: (1) assays for HBV DNA levels as well as determination of nucleotide sequence or special tests for genotyping, identification of viral mutants; (2) assays for hepatitis B markers including levels of HBsAg, HBeAg, and antibodies to hepatitis B; (3) non-invasive markers or imaging tests that might reflect state of viral replication, disease activity and degree of hepatic fibrosis that is currently only assessable by liver biopsy; (4) biomarkers for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in these high risk patients, using approaches such as proteomics, serum tumor markers and imaging tests, (5) antiviral agents for hepatitis B including nucleoside analogues, combinations of nucleoside analogues and peginterferon; (6) novel antiviral agents that might have yet to be proven effective in chronic hepatitis B and might be used in pilot clinical trials such as small molecule inhibitors of other steps in the HBV replicative cycle, molecular therapies aimed at HBV DNA such as siRNAs, and immunological therapies such as therapeutic vaccines or cytokines/anticytokines; (7) novel hepatoprotective therapies that might ameliorate the disease or enlist natural antiviral activity such as anti-oxidants, immune stimulants and cytokines; and (8) complementary therapies such as herbal medicines.  

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories.  They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services.  The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator.  Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort.  The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration.  The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA.  Examples of the Clinical Trial Agreement and the CRADA can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Multi-Well Sample Plate Cover Penetration System for Automated Reagent Mixing and Aspiration
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY

Multi-Well Sample Plate Cover Penetration System
for Automated Reagent Mixing and Aspiration

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to commercialize its multi-well sample plate cover penetration system for automated reagent mixing.

Background: Automation platforms employ sample arrays that need access but must be protected from well-to-well cross contamination. Current accepted standard laboratory protocols are concerned with a proven cross contamination vector of the plate-sealing-tape removal process. The tape is currently peeled back from the entire plate by hand, generating adhesive strings that cross wells, aerosolize solvents and analytes, and can contaminate other open wells. Additionally, the manual tape removal process can jostle the wells, spilling and mixing products into adjacent wells. Currently, to circumvent these issues, much slower and more time consuming processes are performed instead of tape sealing such as removal of samples from the plate and processing with individual capillary tubes which is a tremendous disadvantage in both time and expense. Or, entire rows and columns are left unused to reduce sample proximity, which doubles the number of plates required and similarly increases the analysis time.

Description:  LLNL?s multi-well plate cover penetration system is an array cutting and tape folding tool, based on 96-well, 384-well, and 1536-well geometries, that can be robotically operated and will cut, open, and fold inward the sealing tape so that samples can be subsequently aspirated without the need for human intervention to remove the seal which is an aerosol generating and contaminating process). To view a diagram of the system go to: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/MultiWellSamplePlateCover.php

Advantages:  This device will eliminate cross contamination and automate another step in the experimental protocol, improving accuracy while reducing both time and expense.

Potential Applications:  Common multi-well formats include 96-well, 384-well, and the new 1536-well plates that are utilized in research, academia, and industry. Uses for LLNL?s multi-well plate cover system include bench-top automated reagent mixing and analysis systems such as those used for bioterrorism analysis, clinical and medical diagnostics, genetic analysis and sequencing, drug discovery, protein crystallography, biological engineering, environmental monitoring and analysis, biological and chemical research, and forensics. 

Development Status:  A patent application has been filed. A marketing prototype is under development for evaluation. 


LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Multi-Well Sample Plate Cover Penetration System for automated reagent mixing should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

In the discharge of this responsibility each VA Regional Office Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Service Division (VR&amp;E) within the Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA) undertakes an initial evaluation of the veteran to determine his or her eligibility and entitlement for these services and assistance; develops, in cooperation with the veteran, an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP); and provides the veteran with employment placement and post-placement services or, if employment is not possible, services to enhance the veteran's independence in daily living. The objective of this contract is to provide assistance to VR&amp;E in the following areas:  (1) initial evaluation; (2) case management of veterans rehabilitative program; (3) draft IWRP development; and (4) assist the veteran in finding employment consistent with his or her aptitudes, interests and abilities or, if employment is not achievable in achieving maximum independence in daily living.  The government contemplates awarding an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contracts utilizing Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task order.  The NAICS Code for this effort is 624310 Vocational Rehabilitation Services.  VBA is seeking participation on a survey to determine common business practices in the VR&amp;E arena.

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner for use with US visa programs.  For the past few years, fingerprint scanners have been a component of the US Government’s biometric initiative to prevent the processing of duplicate applications with altered personal information (name, place of birth, date of birth, etc.) and the subsequent issuance of visas based on fraudulent data.  Recently, the US Congress mandated the capture of all 10 fingerprints of visa applicants for whom US Consular officials receive information that indicates that they may have US law enforcement records.  Traditional fingerprint collection methods employing paper cards and ink are slow and inaccurate.  Due to this factor, the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to enhance and expedite the capture process by making it entirely electronic. <BR><BR>In coordination with the FBI, Consular Affairs is scheduled to pilot 10-fingerprint capture at US Consulates in Riyadh and Dharan in September 2006. Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian scanners are required for this project.  They were selected because they have been extensively tested and used by the FBI.  The scanner is the first live scan device to meet the size and functional requirements of the Joint Agency User Group.  The Guardian L SCAN is certified for both civil identification flats and full criminal 10-print rolls and flats, and the image quality complies with the FBI EFTS Appendix F.  Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner is found to be the most robust and reliable (in terms of output and data capture and interpretation) units of their kind now available. The addition of ten print fingerprint scanning technology will enable the Bureau to identify applicants with criminal or other US law enforcement records based on biometric data, regardless of the written personal information submitted on their applications.  This will ensure that the Department of State fully complies with Section 303 of The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.  The legislation specifically states that the Department of State must “issue to aliens only machine-readable tamper resistant visas and other travel and entry documents that use biometric identifiers”.   CA requires that any scanner selected for the pilot must meet the following software compatibility requirements: •	Must utilize an IEEE-1394 PC interface for high speed and efficiency of processing. •	Must be able to read images from an Oracle database. •	Must be able to process the image and store the results into an Oracle database. The LS-2 fingerprint scanner features a solid-state design, which reduces the probability of machine failure.  Furthermore, its IEEE-1394 PC interface addresses a critical requirement due to the following reasons: •	Speed of data integration, the IEEE-1394 is the fastest available interface for this type of equipment •	High quality images that do not require repeat scanning •	IEEE-1394 ports come standard in many PC’s, are easily acquired in the commercial market, and are technologically current In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner requested without delay so that the pilot testing required for the verification of field functionality can commence as scheduled <BR><BR>

Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

Chloride UPS 100kVA (UB2B) SN: B202027 (40 batteries)
Chloride UPS 100kVA (UB2C) SN: B240309 (40 batteries)
Chloride UPS 250kVA (UB2D) SN: B210506 (40 batteries)

Requirement:
All of the batteries located within these UPS systems are at least 4.5 to 5 years old. As batteries age, they begin to fail at higher and higher rates. The recommended shelf life of a rechargeable UPS battery is about 5 years. After that time period, confidence in the UPS carrying the load it was designed for is diminished. Therefore, as each string of batteries reaches their 'end of life', replacement is required to maintain UPS operational effectiveness. ESRL/GSD requires the purchase of 120 (12-370) and 80 (12-270) replacement batteries with the associated service and installation procedures for the above listed equipment.

Sole Make & Model Justification:
1.	Chloride Power Protection utilizes the C&D Dynasty batteries for UPS applications as follows:
UPS series: ESRL/GSD units currently utilize the C&D Dynasty part numbers UPS12-270FR, UPS12-370FR.; The C&D Dynasty batteries include a 3 year full replacement, 7 year prorated warranty as negotiated through Chloride Power Protection; The C&D Dynasty batteries are shipped in flame retardant cases.
Chloride has chosen the C&D Dynasty battery line due to excellent performance, warranty and design; NOAA/ESRL/GSD UPS units have utilized the UPS series batteries since original purchase of the UPS units on site.
Battery replacement service includes, but is not limited to: Removal of spent batteries; Installation of new batteries; Rectifier calibration; Re-torquing of all interconnections; Resistance measurements of all battery connections; Battery discharge test; Proper disposal of spent batteries; Labor, travel and expenses.

2.	NOAA/ESRL/GSD UPS units are currently covered under the Chloride Manufacturer's warranty.  This warranty includes the following coverage:  7X24 coverage for the cost of parts, labor and travel to repair the UPS. (Batteries not included); Each UPS contract includes (2) annual PM visits which include: Internal inspection of UPS system cabinets; Complete operational testing of UPS; Battery voltage verification; Visual inspection of battery/transformer cabinets; Re-torquing of all battery interconnects, if necessary; Re-torquing of all interconnections between system cabinets, if necessary; Resistance measurements of all battery connections; All related labor, travel and expenses; Does not include the cost of parts or labor to replace any batteries found to be suspect during inspection

3.	Chloride battery replacements are to be performed by Chloride factory trained, certified and authorized personnel only. Any maintenance whether corrective, routine or emergency performed by 3rd party service groups will affect the existing warranties (including but not limited) in the following ways:  
All existing warranties will become null and void; Reinstatement of warranties will require recertification on each unit that has been maintained by 3rd party service groups. 

Chloride reserves the right to reject the recertification on any UPS requiring part replacement, displays improper settings, unit failure, etc. Recertification requires any and all parts requiring replacement or any corrective labor needed be completed by Chloride technicians at an additional cost.  Chloride will reserve the right to refuse recertification for a UPS with regard to battery replacement due to, but not limited to:  Batteries installed that are outside the specified manufacturer;  Batteries installed that are not in a flame retardant case; Batteries installed displaying outdated date codes; Batteries installed displaying mixed date codes; Batteries installed shown to be defective, used, corroded, damaged, etc.

Chloride purchases and receives batteries direct from the manufacturer, not a battery distributor.  The units are shipped directly from the manufacturer to the end user which aids in the elimination of freight damage, aged batteries, batteries with mixed date codes, etc.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of NOAA/ESRL/GSD to purchase the replacement batteries from Chloride Power Protection, thereby maintaining the existing warranties, avoiding additional costs, and realizing the best value.

This synopsis is being prepared IAW FAR Part 5. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Additional information regarding the specifications for this DDS Signal Generator Model 1940A can be found at http://www.novatech-instr.com. JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: 1. Contracting Activity – Department of the Air Force, 37th Contracting Squadron LGCBD, 1655 Selfridge Avenue, Bldg 5450, Rm 206, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-5253. 2. Nature and/or description of action being processed- This will be a firm fixed-price contract for four Novatech Model 1940A/S-04 DDS Signal Generators exclusively manufactured and distributed by NOVATECH INSTRUMENTS, INC. 3. Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agency’s needs- 310th MI BN, Bldg 4552, 4553 Pike Rd, Ft Meade, MD 20755-5995 needs to purchase four DDS Signal Generators capable of producing four simultaneous RF outputs at frequencies and amplitudes necessary to drive simulators already in use for the purposes of training in the TEMPEST element. The specified DDS Signal Generators manufactured and distributed by NOVATECH are currently in use and make it necessary to purchase the additional items to maintain consistency in equipment. 4. Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition- 10 U.S.C. 2330 (b)(1)(ii) as amended by section 801 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2002 and Federal Regulation (FAR) 8.404 and FAR 6.302-1. 5. Demonstration that Brand’s unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires the use of only one particular brand authority- Simulators purchased by the National Security Agency (NSA) for the TEMPEST Element training program require signal generators capable of producing four simultaneous outputs at frequencies and amplitudes sufficient to drive the simulators.  The DDS Signal Generators Model 1940A/S-04 manufactured and distributed by NOVATECH Inc are the only Signal Generators currently on the market capable of accomplishing this requirement. No other piece of equipment satisfactorily provides the capabilities of the NOVATECH Model 1940A/S-04 DDS Signal Generator. 6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable- NOVATECH is the only company that makes or distributes this signal generator. An internet search was conducted by both the end user and contracting specialist to locate companies capable of providing this item. The specifications for this signal generator were sent to more than one company specializing in signal generators. Of those companies who responded all indicated that that they did not have a product that could accomplish the same results at this time. 7. Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable- The contracting Officer shall determine the price offered to be fair and reasonable through one or more of the following: A. Comparison of proposed prices (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(i)) B. Comparison of previously proposed priced  and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for the same or similar items (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)) C. Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(iv)) D. Comparison of proposed prices with independent government cost estimates. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(v)) E. Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through open market research for the same or similar items. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(vi)) F. Analysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(vii)) G. The CO’s personal knowledge of the item being purchased. 8. Description of the market research conducted and the results, or a statement of the reasons market research was not conducted- The 344 TRS TEMPEST Element conducted research to locate signal generators capable of providing the outputs required to drive the simulators purchased for the TEMPEST training element by the NSA. The contracting specialist assigned to this acquisition conducted market research on the internet and through the Small Business dynamic business search and found that there was no other company that produced a DDS Signal Generator capable of the same functions as specified by the NOVATECH DDS Signal Generators. NOVATECH Instruments Inc. is the only known source that can satisfy the government’s requirement. The cost of having another company develop or adapt a similar signal generator would be prohibitive. Other alternatives are cost prohibitive as well. This procurement is being synopsized IAW FAR Part 5. The anticipated award date is 1 Aug 06.  Delivery is expected six weeks after receipt of contract. The POC’s for this acquisition are: Terrie Seybold at 210-671-1755 or via e-mail at: terrie.seybold@lackland.af.mil or Ms. Anita L. Guadiano at 210-671-1772 or via e-mail at anita.guadiano@lackland.af.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are  being requested and a more detailed solicitation is available on the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FEDTEDS) Web Page at http://www.fedteds.gov/  or at https://www.fedteds.gov/fedteds/start.nsf/frm.VendorLogin?OpenForm&SolicitationNumber=W912HZ-07-T-00 07 , which includes exhibits that could not be posted as this site. Offerors should check the FEDTEDS Web Page often for new solicitations and/or changes (AMENDMENTS) to existing ones. Solicitation Number W912HZ-07-T-0007 is being issued as a request for q uotation (RFQ) with the intent to award as a simplified acquisition. The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-13.  This procurement is 100% set aside for small business c oncerns under NAICS Code 541380 (SIC 8734) with a size standard of $11,000,000. The USACE, Vicksburg District, Consolidated Contracting Office, proposes to award a simplified acquisition for Geotechnical borings and soil sampling at American Dam, El Paso, Texas.   1. Introduction.  Twelve borings will be drilled at the American Dam, El Paso,TX, for the U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) to support the under-seepage analysis at the structure.  The drilling and soil sampling work will be performed  in conjunction with an engineering analysis of the sheet pile cutoff upstream of the dam, under-seepage analyses of the foundation, and ground penetrating radar surveys (GPR) beneath the concrete aprons to determine whether voids are present in the founda tion. 2. Drilling.  Borings will be drilled by a geotechnical company with soil testing capabilities that have been certified by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) lab certification program.  Costs and time associated with the mobilization and demobilization  of drilling crews and equipment, and shipping costs associated with transporting soil samples for laboratory soil testing are critical.  The geotechnical soils testing laboratory must be identified on the approved Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), Geotechnical and Structures Laboratory (GSL) Materials Testing Center website at http://gsl.erdc.usace.army.mil/gsl.html.  This website provides a listing for USACE certified labs nationwide.  A local El Paso soils testing lab is required because E RDC personnel will work with the drilling contractor to identify the selected soil samples for later laboratory soils testing.  Because the drilling, sampling, and soils testing are part of other concurrent studies, it is necessary for the laboratory to be  in the local area to minimize travel by the Government Point of Contact (POC). 3. Specifications.  Specifications for the drilling, soil sampling, and testing are described as follows: 3a. Boring Locations and Depths.  Exact boring locations will be provided to the contractor prior to drilling.  Borings will be drilled in the channel upstream and downstream of the American Dam during the non-irrigation season, and at each abutment.  Four  deep borings to determine the stratigraphy beneath the dam will be drilled as part of this scope of work.  Deep borings will be drilled to bedrock or 100 ft maximum depth depending on whichever is less.  Deep borings will be drilled in the channel upstrea m and downstream of the dam.  Two borings will be drilled in each abutment to 50 ft maximum depth or bedrock to determine the abutment stratigraphy and properties.  Additionally, six shallow borings to 30 ft depth will be drilled in the channel area upstre am and downstream of the dam to characterize the soil texture and stratigraphy beneath the dam. Access roads to the floodplain will be constructed by the International Boundary and Water Commission  (IBWC).  A temporary cofferdam to divert river flow into the American Canal will be constructed by the IBWC to permit the safe occupation of the floodplain for drilling and the dewatering of the upstream, northeast corner of the dam. Dewatering of the ups tream corner of the dam will be conducted to permit sheet-pile inspection using a commercial company (not part of this scope of work).  Screening of boring locations will be performed by the drilling contractor through Texas One-Stop utility service and US IBWC to avoid utility lines (gas, electric, water, etc.).  3b. Falling Head Tests.  Two falling head tests at channel locations to be determined will be conducted to characterize the in-situ permeability of floodplain soils.  Falling head tests will be conducted either through the hollow-stem auger and/or installa tion of temporary piezometers. 3c. Sampling Procedures.  Split spoon samples will be taken at 2-1/2 ft interval over the first 15 ft of the boring depth, and at 5 ft sample interval below 15 ft depth (i.e., 20, 25, 30, 35, etc.).  Blow counts will be recorded on the field boring logs at  0.5 ft interval and samples will be made using a 140 lb drop hammer and standard split-spoon.  A larger split-spoon may be used providing it is cleared with the Corps site representative. 3d. Field Logging and Reporting.  A boring log will be prepared by the contractor showing the soil lithology, sampling and drilling techniques, blow counts, ground water levels, and other observations of importance.  The boring log should include the class ification and testing of soils by the Unified Soils Classification System (USCS).  A brief letter report describing drilling methods, boring logs, and laboratory soils testing procedures will be presented as a final deliverable under this scope of work. 3e.  Completion of Borings.  Borings will be grouted with a bentonite-portland cement slurry following drilling in accordance with State Regulations.  Grouting will be from the bottom of each hole to the top. 3e.  Laboratory Soil Testing and Laboratory Requirements.  Selected soil samples will sent to a Corps approved laboratory for soil testing as previously defined in paragraph 1 above.  Lab testing will consist of approximately 180 grain size analysis, and 1 0 Atterberg limit tests.

Questions
1.	As we analyze each line item to come up with a firm percentage (minus, plus or net), we assume that the estimated unit prices listed for all 324 CLINS are loaded amounts (OH, G&A, Profit).  Should we make this assumption as we compare the Government estimates to our costs?

Your assumption is correct.  I cannot emphasis enough that you cannot bid individually on all the lines; for example, you cannot bid plus 5 for line item 001 and plus 7 for 002.  You must bid the same price for all the line items.  If you submit different prices for individual line items, your bid will be considered non-responsive and rejected.


2.	Also can you clarify the time allowance for; start of work, time of performance of work and completion time?

It will be different for each task order


3.	Since we will be supplying material and labor to areas outside of our corporate office, we will be allowed lead time for material production and administrative/travel time?

It will be different for each task order


4.	Which RS Means for Construction guide are you using as the Government's standard?

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled REFRIGERANT: VIRGIN UNUSED TETRAFLUORETHANE R-134A which was posted on 11/15/2006. You are notified that the following changes are made: THE FOLLOWING QUESTION IS ANSWERED: 1.  Do they need a pump or do they have their own to get the R-134a from the ISO? ANSWER:  We have a pump, typically the truck also has one. HERE IS WHAT THE SPECIFICATIONS SAY: Refrigerant:  Virgin (unused) 1,1,1,2 Tetrafluorethane (R-134a) shall conform to all requirements of the ARI-700 standard for new refrigerants. The supplier shall provide an ARI-700 Certificate of Analysis for the delivery prior to unloading. The delivery shall be made by tank truck (approximately 40,000 pounds) to NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. The supplier shall provide all hoses, fittings, pumps, and other equipment to connect to the R-134a storage tank. The vapor and liquid connections on the storage tank are quick disconnect "E" series coupling, female dry-disconnect coupler, Hydraulics Inc., Part #CP00110P1G1B. In past deliveries of R-134a, it has been necessary to connect the delivery truck to both the liquid and the vapor side of the Langley storage tank in order to provide the pressure balance needed to pump the delivered liquid R-134a into the storage tank. The Langley liquid storage tank, while primarily containing R-134a, may have a low mixture of air in the vapor layer that can contaminate the delivery truck. Recent vendors have overcome this problem by using an auxiliary pump on their tractor to pump the delivery trailer to a near vacuum (dumping the gas mixture back into the Langley storage tank). Apparently the contamination level is considered acceptable at this reduced pressure condition. The supplier shall provide a weight certificate at the time of delivery, as well as a Material Safety Data Sheet. The due date for responses IS NOT extended. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).
