<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT<br />REDWOOD NATIONAL AND STATE PARKS<br />PROVIDE DESIGN DETAIL WORK and FABRICATE INTERACTIVE WAYSIDE EXHIBITS ALONG THE NEWTON B. DRURY SCENIC PARKWAY<br />RFP No. P15PS00109<br /><br />The National Park Service at Redwood National and State Parks (located in coastal Northern California) has designed a series of both traditional and interactive wayside exhibits to engage visitors along the Old Redwood Highway; the Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway. The Scenic Parkway is a ten-mile stretch of road that provides unparalleled views and access to one the largest surviving contiguous swaths of Old Growth Redwood Forest.</p>
<p>The design portion of the project involves the creation of an orientation map (based on existing National Geographic, NPS, and State Park maps) and eight trail head maps that zoom-in on specific trails within the orientation map; details for custom corten steel wayside frames and full size animal silhouettes; a tactile map that compares the original old growth forest to remaining forest lands as well as other tactile features such as Redwood tree elements, plants and animals of the area; coordinating with park staff to record a brief audio welcome message from Yurok Tribal members; the creation of simple illustrations of Redwood tree features; as well as the mechanics of some simple interactive elements (fixed location viewing tubes and a listening dish).<br /><br />Design intent drawings will be provided as an attachment to the RFP. Visual references, resources, and suggested materials are included in the design intent package. All details concerning design construction will be a key piece of the design requirement. Graphic panels are 60% complete and samples are included in the package. All graphic panels will be completed by an NPS design professional. Images are being sourced and text is in development. Graphic panel files will be provided to the contractor during the post award meeting.</p>
<p>The fabrication portion of the project involves basic prototyping and sampling of custom elements to ensure effectiveness, as well as production, and installation of all exhibit elements.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a single, fixed price service contract. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include one base line item covering Phase 1 of work (Design), and one option line item covering Phase 2 of work (Fabrication), which is SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. The total period of performance including both base and option line item work is estimated to be March of 2015 through April 2016.</p>
<p>Award selection will be made on a Best Value determination made after consideration of price and factors other than price (quality: key personnel qualifications, successful relevant experience with similar project, and past performance). Award is subject to the availability of funding.</p>
<p>The North American Standard Industrial Classifications System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 541430, with a corresponding size standard of $7.5 million in annual gross receipts for the past three years.</p>
<p>This acquisition is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. Offers are solicited only from small business concerns. Offers received from concerns that are not small business concerns shall be considered nonresponsive and will be rejected.</p>
<p>The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on/about Monday, December 8, 2014 by electronic means only and can be downloaded along with all related attachments from the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fbo.gov and/or FedConnect website at http://www.fedconnect.net. The RFP will close 30 days from the actual date of issuance. Interested parties are responsible for periodically checking the website for any Amendments that may be issued prior to the closing date of the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested parties may explore the Redwood National and State Parks website to acquaint themselves with the general area and to view park maps at <a href="http://www.nps.gov/REDW">http://www.nps.gov/REDW</a>.</p>
