PRICE AND DELIVERY ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>New - initial acceptance will be at the discretion of the acceptor during the delivery. All items required must be fully functional, present, and compatible as required by the SOW. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 60 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 60 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 60 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>

<CONTACT>Michael H. Ku, Email mku@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The Rocky Mountain Region of the US Forest Service anticipates awarding two or more indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts for Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) work. The IDIQ will have a base year and four option years.&nbsp; Forest Service management direction includes emergency response, rehabilitation, and restoration of resources. More specifically, management includes the implementation of emergency and non-emergency land treatments to meet the objectives of protecting watershed values and land uses within watersheds. These emergency response, rehabilitation and restoration contracts include the use of proven effective land treatments to meet agency objectives. The land treatments that are part of these contracts are aerial-based applications of mulch (agricultural or wood). These are very common treatments that are used for BAER, watershed improvement, road maintenance and habitat improvement programs. Mulch applications have been found to be effective at reducing erosion and runoff on burned areas, construction sites, and other areas where a protective surface cover can lessen recovery time. <br />The success of emergency response, rehabilitation and restoration of watersheds relies on the ability to mobilize and implement expeditiously. The intent of these contracts is to meet objectives of protecting, rehabilitating, or restoring watersheds and other land resources.<br />The awardee of this contract will provide Helicopter mulching services. The contract will include 2 types of mulching: agricultural straw and wood shred. For agricultural straw mulching, the contractor will be responsible for procuring the straw, providing ground transportation of the straw to the helicopter staging area, and loading and dropping the straw via helicopters at specified locations. For wood shred mulching, the contractor will not be responsible for procuring or manufacturing the wood shred. The contractor will be responsible for transporting government furnished wood shred from a location within 100 miles of the helicopter staging area. The contractor will then be responsible for loading and dropping the straw via helicopters at specified locations. The size of the treatment locations will vary significantly for each task order and may range from 10's to 1000's of acres in size. <br />This solicitation will be a total small business set-aside under NAICS code 115310 (support activities for forestry). The size standard is average annual receipts of less than $7 M. <br />The work may occur within Region 2 of the USDA Forest Service, which includes forest lands within the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, and Kansas.<br />The government anticipates posting the solicitation on www.fbo.gov after December 6, 2012. Please continue to check back to this synopsis for the solicitation after December 6, 2012. Please note that this solicitation number is TBD due to a current procurement system migration within the Forest Service. <br />

<DESC>Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) that may result in the award of multiple-award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) General Construction Contracts. The Government reserves the right to award as many or as few as deemed to be in the best interest of the Government. It is anticipated, that these IDIQ contracts will have a five year period of performance. The contracts will have IDIQ ordering provisions under which the Government may award Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders for general construction requirements. Under the delivery orders, the contractor will be required to furnish all management, labor, equipment, and/or materials necessary for the performance of construction, demolition, modification, repair, and/or rehabilitation of facilities located onsite at MSFC, or operated by MSFC. The specific work requirements will be included in the delivery orders. The IDIQ contracts will not be "requirements contracts" and therefore the Government may, at its sole discretion, utilize other procurements to satisfy its general construction requirements. Under the ordering provisions of the proposed IDIQ contracts, the Government may utilize competitive or noncompetitive procurement procedures to solicit future delivery order bids from the IDIQ contractors. Bids will generally be solicited from all of the IDIQ contractors on a competitive basis. It is estimated that 20 to 30 delivery orders with a total combined price of $2.5 million will be awarded annually. The estimated price range of the delivery orders will be between $25,000 and $2.5 million annually. The anticipated maximum IDIQ value for each contract will be $20M. This amount represents the maximum cumulative value of the delivery orders the Government may award under each IDIQ contract. The RFP will not include specifications and drawings (see procedure for requesting below) for a delivery order (a sample construction project) that will be subject to award to one of the selected IDIQ contractors. The decision to award or not award the delivery order is solely within the discretion of the Government. The delivery order will be representative in nature of the tasks to be ordered under the proposed IDIQ general construction contracts. Offerors will be required to submit a price proposal for the delivery order as part of its proposal for the IDIQ contracts.

1) Acoustic-Rapid COTS Insertion (A-RCI)
The A-RCI AN/BQQ-10 Program is a sonar program that provides processing and display upgrades to all Class submarine sonar sensors through rapid insertion of COTS-based hardware and software.  A-RCI acoustic system improvements provide enhancements to the capabilities of receiving, assimilating, processing, evaluating, localizing and displaying tactical data.
  In addition, these improvements eliminate obsolescence issues and achieve life cycle cost savings by expediting commonality of systems for reduced infrastructure support.  These upgrades are accomplished using Technology Insertions (TI) and Advanced Processing Builds (APB) processes.  Every even year, the hardware baseline is modified to incorporate newer technology via a TI.  Every other year (in the odd years), the system software must be modified to accept new APB, which may require firmware and hardware changes.  This newest software delivery then becomes the basis for the next hardware TI and so on. 

Under solicitation N00024-13-R-6267, an RFP will be issued for the development and production of ARCI for TI-16 and TI-18 with APB-15 and higher.
  Procurement will occur via a full and open competitive contract spanning FY14 through FY21.  This procurement includes engineering and technical services, production, installation support, trainers and in-service support for the following submarine classes: SSN688/688I, SEAWOLF, SSBN, SSGN and VIRGINIA.  

2) Ownship Monitoring System (OMS)
The OMS replaces the Total Ship Monitoring System (TSMS), which was procured under Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) topic.  TSMS is currently in-service as part of the Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI) family of submarine SONAR systems.  TSMS monitors and localizes ownship's noise sources including transients.  OMS will be procured via a performance specification and will upgrade the previous TSMS capability with COTS products and Non-Developmental Item (NDI).
  OMS will be delivered as GFE to the ARCI program for system integration, testing and shipboard installation.
  
Under solicitation N00024-13-R-6268, an RFP will be issued for the development and production of OMS for Technical Insertions 16 through 18 (TI16 - TI18).  Procurement will occur via a full and open competitive contract spanning FY14 through FY18.  This procurement includes engineering and technical services, production, installation support, trainers and in-service support for the SSN688/688I, SEAWOLF, SSBN, SSGN and VIRGINIA submarine classes.  
 
3) Common Acoustic Cabinet (CAC)
The CAC is the next generation array-processing cabinet and will replace the Multi-Purpose Processor (MPP), which was procured under a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) topic.
  MPP is currently in-service as part of the Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI) family of submarine SONAR systems.  MPP is a multi-array interface receiver that provides: (i) signal conditioning for received array signals, (ii) processing of TSMS data, (iii) digital formatting of data, (iv) beam formation, and (v) signal processing as required for A-RCI display data.  CAC constitutes the next generation of array-processing that provides capability upgrades via rapid insertion of COTS-based hardware and Non-Developmental Item (NDI).  CAC upgrades signal processing capability and permits reconfiguration necessary to support processing data from multiple acoustic and array sensors.  CAC will be delivered as GFE to the ARCI program for system integration, testing and shipboard installation.
 

Under solicitation N00024-13-R-6269, an RFP will be issued for the development and production of CAC for Technical Insertions 16 through 18 (TI16 - TI18).  The procurement will be conducted as a Small Business Set-aside competitive contract spanning FY14 through FY18.  This procurement includes engineering and technical services, production, installation support, trainers and in-service support for the SSN688/688I and SSGN submarine classes.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, for a one-year lease for a 2012 Volvo D13 on-highway heavy-duty diesel engine, portable control system, exhaust after-treatment system, and diagnostic tools, for the Assessment and Standards Division, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
This engine will be used to support efforts in developing and refining inputs to the EPA?s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Model (GEM).  The Volvo D13 engine was selected because it is the only high-sales-volume, 2010 emissions and 2012 OBD compliant engine which can provide needed GEM input data in the mid-displacement 13 liters, 300 to 500 HP engine category.  The Volvo engine uses the predominant technology for controlling Nox emissions in the U.S. and European heavy-duty truck markets, which is urea-based selective catalytic reduction (SCR) exhaust aftertreatment.  
The EPA has identified Volvo Group Trucks Technology as the only provider that meets all specifications for a 2012 Volvo D13 on-highway heavy-duty diesel engine, portable control system, exhaust after-treatment system, and diagnostic tools.
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR 13.501(a)(ii) Sole Source.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST be submitted within 10 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your request in writing to Gerold Young by fax to 513-487-2853 or by email to young.gerold@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The primary function of the buildings and facilities under consideration is to serve as federal office buildings, United States Courthouses and land ports of entry into the United States from Canada.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The court houses are active and cannot be shut down or interrupted.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Specific U.S. Marshall&rsquo;s security procedures must be followed prior to any entry or project and the time for clearance should be considered in the project plan.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Various customs, immigration, administrative and other related inspection and office space is involved.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Due to international trade and travel, concerns about contraband, security considerations, and other considerations there is equipment specific to the operations of the LPOEs present on site. This may include computers, large areas that are lighted for security purposes, machines capable of X-raying tractor trailer trucks for contraband, inspection booths, license plate readers, radiation monitors, surveillance cameras, and other equipment.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">LPOEs experience high volumes of traffic both vehicle and foot.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Many of these facilities are operated on a 24 hour- seven day a week basis.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The mission requirements of Federal Tenant agencies may limit energy reduction opportunities in some respects.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Security Clearances will also require time for processing and this should be included in any schedule or plans for site inspections or preliminary audits.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Many of the LPOEs handle both commercial and private vehicle traffic.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Due to NAFTA and increasing focus on cross border trade, drug and immigration issues, many of the LPOEs are undergoing expansion or witnessing increased traffic and use.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Scope Summary:</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The intent of this project is to utilize both traditional energy efficiency projects and renewable energy to accomplish that objective.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The buildings and this project are intended to become High Performance Green Buildings as that term is defined in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">All equipment and components used shall be Energy Star certified (where appropriate) and of the highest energy or other efficiency that can reasonably, economically, and presently be obtained with current state of the art equipment. The Contractor shall be responsible for the physical installation of the improvements and equipment. The ESCO should also be knowledgeable and experienced in traditional energy conservation and energy efficiency technologies and construction methods as well as renewable sources of energy production.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">GSA is seeking to obtain highly sustainable, highly energy efficient buildings and facilities. Lighting, building envelope, Glazing and HVAC systems, and building automation control systems and programming is another area where specialized experience and knowledge is required as is HVAC and energy storage system design and thermal storage system design and operation.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">ESCOs should also have experience with facilities such as US court houses, LPOEs that have unique traffic flows and operational considerations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The successful contractor will have to be knowledgeable and capable of construction of Energy Star and LEED certified buildings and of obtaining those certifications for any facility that does not yet have them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Potential ECMs include but are not limited to renewable energy sources i.e. solar PV systems, lighting system upgrades, energy storage systems, water conservation systems, and other potential ECMs identified after the preliminary audit and consultation with the building managers and GSA&rsquo;s Energy Team (see Appendix 1, IDIQ Contract Attachment J-3) for comprehensive list.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The GSA has completed energy audits and retro commissioning studies at many of the proposed locations.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The completed studies will be made available to the ESCOs selected to submit proposals for their use, but without representation by the government as to any outcome or result relative to a project.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The contractor may make use of the reports and data, but must draw their own expert conclusions from their analysis of this data. The Government offers no representation or warranty with respect to this data.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">ESCOs are expected to conduct their own due diligence and to make use of existing study information as well as any other materials provided.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">The Government will not release the internal economic evaluation of the any completed studies, but will use this as part of its internal government estimate to evaluate proposed cost of the project.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">GSA expects the ESCO to propose the optimal mix of renewable and other technologies to most cost effectively serve the needs of the proposed.&nbsp; All ECMs proposed in the preliminary assessment will be reviewed by the Government (and after discussion) either included, or excluded from the proposed scope of work.</span></p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers.

If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number.

Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<SOLNBR>FA8621-12-D-6337
<RESPDATE>113012
<CONTACT>Shelley Coffe, Contracting Officer , Phone 9372554908, Email Shelley.Coffe@wpafb.af.mil - Valerie Wetzel, Contract Negotiator, Phone 9372552930, Email valerie.wetzel@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>F-16 Training Systems (TS) Services Sources Sought Notice<br />Description
<p>I. Sources Sought Synopsis: This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted. <br /><br />a) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide training services for F-16 Training Systems (TS) following the end of the existing services contract in December 2012. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p>b) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and Proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Companies responding to this market research are advised that participation does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation in this research. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this SSS.</p>
<p>c) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Sources Sought Synopsis, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br /><br />d) Background: L3 Communications (L3) is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the Taiwanese F-16 trainer located at Luke AFB, AZ that supports advanced F-16 training for the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF). In 2008, the country of Taiwan conducted a source selection to upgrade the trainer located in Taiwan and the one Unit Level Trainer (ULT) device located at Luke AFB. Chung Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST), a ROCAF company was selected to perform the upgrade and provide Contractor Logistic Support (CLS). After award to CSIST, it was realized that a foreign national contractor cannot provide on-site support at a United States Air Force (USAF) installation. In order to facilitate support for the training device at Luke, L3 was contracted to provide CLS support under OO-ALC, Hill AFB UT contract FA8223-08-C-0003. This SSS is for follow-on CLS support for 2 years and 3 months beginning on 1 January 2013. The base period of performance will be 1 January 2013-31 March 2013 with 2 one-year options.</p>
<p>Unless there are viable respondents to this SSS that can meet the requirements specified herein, the USAF anticipates award of a sole source contract to L3 by 1 January 2013 to fulfill this requirement. This effort will be under the F-16 Training Systems (TS) contract FA8621-12-D-6337.</p>
<p>II. Program Requirements: The offeror must have the ability to locate an individual(s) on-site at Luke AFB to support the Taiwanese trainer for the purposes of providing daily support as well as maintenance before, after, and during training hours. Training hours have been established as eight hours per day Monday through Friday. The offeror shall support night-flight operations that include an operating day commencing at 1030 and completing at 1900 with a 5-day notice from the contracting officer representative on-site. There is no limit as to the amount of night-flight hours per month. The night-flight operations are based on the training schedule established by the instructors at Luke AFB. The potential offeror will be required to have fully trained technicians on-site at Luke AFB beginning 1 January 2013 with no transition from the incumbent.</p>
<p>This support shall be accomplished without technical data, to include drawings or design descriptions and meet the contractual on-call availability of no more than 72 hours of down time. If this cannot be met each hour over 72 is deducted from the monthly payment as a percentage. The offeror will accept these conditions with the understanding that the CSIST travels to the United States to complete software and hardware modifications with a one or two week notice, two or more times each year. Because of these periodic modifications the configuration of the device is unknown. After CSIST departs, it is up to the offeror to trouble shoot any resulting discrepancies with little to no documentation and have the simulator available to the students during the contracted hours stated above. If the offeror cannot establish a fully viable trainer after the CSIST modifications have been completed, the 72 hour availability clock starts. If the simulator is not fully mission capable within the 72 hour rule the monthly CLS billing will be deducted as a percentage based on the number of hours contracted. Since the modifications completed in 2008, all spare parts to repair the simulator are required to come from Taiwan. The offeror is still held accountable for the 72 hour availability rule even though spares are required to be procured from the country of Taiwan.</p>
<p>The offeror will be required to have a secret security clearance, be a US owned company, provide a US Citizen, and be authorized to work on a US Air Force installation beginning on 1 January 2013. The offeror must demonstrate an ability through previous work with Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contracts and have the proper registration with the Department of State (DoS) in place prior to 1 January 2013 in order to facilitate the requirements of this effort.</p>

<a href="mailto:michael.hetle@nasa.gov">Mr. Michael  Hetle</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA is considering the initiation of an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Airspace Operations Challenge (hereinafter Challenge) to be conducted under the Centennial Challenges Program administered through NASA Headquarters located in Washington, D.C. Through this Opportunity Notice (NOTICE) NASA seeks to select a Lead Allied Organization and additional Supporting Allied Organization(s) to work with NASA to conduct this Challenge.   Overall coordination of the Lead and Supporting Allied Organizations will be done by a NASA Challenge manager.  The date for Challenge competition is expected to be between August 30, 2013 and June 30, 2014 depending upon the availability of a test range and competitor registration date. A description of the Challenge outlining NASAs objectives and Challenge Concept of Operation is provided in Appendix 1 to this NOTICE.  NASA previously released this information in a Request for Information (RFI) on October 16, 2012. The RFI link is http://go.usa.gov/YNNH	 . Organizations may submit proposals for consideration as either Lead Allied Organization or Supporting Allied Organization.  A Lead Allied Organization will be expected to address all areas of the Challenge discussed in the description section while Supporting Organizations may address as many areas as they wish to be considered. Allied Organizations would be responsible for some, or all, of the following: 	Provide and operate a UAS flight range to host the UAS AOC. 	Qualify potential competitors with regard to the flightworthiness of their aircraft and their compliance with the UAS AOC rules. 	Provide and operate a UAS Traffic Squadron that can provide cooperative air traffic management for the challenge competitors. 	Provide a Ghost Squadron capability that dynamically generates TIS-B messages for simulated aircraft whose flight paths are closely coordinated with actual aircraft that are in flight and participating in the Challenge. 	Challenge planning. 	Sponsor recruitment. 	Competitor recruitment. 	Challenge administration and execution. 	Challenge marketing and publicity. Appendix 2 provides a more extensive description of these areas of opportunity for Allied Organizations to partner with NASA in completing the execution phase of the Challenge. Further refinements and creative enhancements of the Challenge objectives by the Allied Organizations, with the concurrence of NASA, are encouraged. NASA provides the monetary prize purse (which can be supplemented by outside organizations) but no funding for the conduct of the competition itself.  Allied Organizations must administer the Challenges with their own funding, or they must acquire the funding needed to administer the Challenges through agreements with sponsoring organizations or through other means.  NASA will not provide any funds or cost reimbursement to any of the Allied Organizations for their work in connection with the Challenge. Sponsoring organizations are those entities that team with an Allied Organization to augment the prize purse, provide funding for administrative expenses of the Allied Organization, operating expenses of the Allied Organization and/or provide in-kind support through separate agreements with the Allied Organization.  SPACE ACT AGREEMENTS NASA anticipates entering into Nonreimbursable Space Act Agreements with one Lead and one or more Supporting Allied Organizations.  Selection of Allied Organizations will be through a competitive process based on evaluation of submitted proposals.  Participation as an Allied Organization will be contingent upon selection by NASA and negotiation of an appropriate agreement between NASA and the proposer.  The Nonreimbursable Space Act Agreement will detail the contributions and responsibilities of NASA and the Allied Organization for a specific Challenge.	The agreement will address intellectual property rights, concurrence on rules, team agreements, media rights, insurance, registration fees and eligibility, term, and related areas.  NASA reserves the right to select for Space Act Agreement negotiations all, some, or none of the proposals submitted in response to this NOTICE, and in the event no proposals are selected, NASA reserves the right to post an additional NOTICE or NOTICES in respect of this Challenge.  Respondents will be responsible for funding their own activities associated with responding to this NOTICE and conducting the Challenge. Allied Organizations may collect reasonable registration fees from competitors but the use of registration fees as a primary means to cover Challenge administration costs is discouraged.	An example of a Space Act Agreement for Centennial Challenges Allied Organization is shown in Appendix 3. ELIGIBILITY Domestic, U.S. non-profit organizations are eligible to submit proposals in response to this NOTICE.  Neither Allied Organizations, their employees, nor associates or students associated with the Allied Organization may compete for NASA Prize funds in a Challenge that they manage.  They may compete for non-financial recognition. Allied Organizations and their officers and employees may not have a financial or other interest in any teams that compete in any Challenge(s) they manage. Multiple organizations may form a team to manage the Challenge and may submit a joint proposal. CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES BACKGROUND The NASA Centennial Challenges program was established to conduct prize competitions to generate innovative solutions to technical problems of interest to NASA and the nation. Those competing for the NASA monetary prizes can be individuals, independent teams, student groups, research organizations or private companies.  The program seeks unconventional solutions from non-traditional sources and, thereby, hopes to identify new talent and stimulate the creation of new businesses.  Unlike contracts and grants based on proposals, prizes are only awarded after competitors have successfully demonstrated their innovations.  Competitors retain ownership of their intellectual property. To be eligible to win a NASA Centennial Challenge monetary prize, an individual or entity (1) shall have registered to participate in the competition pursuant to any rules promulgated by NASA; (2) shall have complied with all the rules of the competition and requirements of applicable law; (3) in the case of a private entity, shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States, and in the case of an individual, whether participating singly or in a group, shall be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States; and (4) shall not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment. The Centennial Challenges in the past have typically required several annual competitions to occur before the total prize purses have been claimed.  Competitions have been conducted in a first-to-demonstrate format and in a head-to-head contest format.  The competition events, especially in the head-to-head contest format, typically involve public spectators, televised or webcasted coverage and are utilized as high-visibility opportunities for public outreach.  Additional information can be found at www.nasa.gov/challenges. NEW CENTENNIAL CHALLENGE The specific Challenge under consideration for which an Allied Organization is sought with this NOTICE is the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Airspace Operations Challenge (AOC) which is focused on finding innovative solutions to the problems surrounding the integration of UAS into the National Airspace System (NAS). The approach being considered would require competitors to maintain safe separation from other air traffic while operating their UAS in congested airspace, under a variety of scenarios. This will be accomplished, through the use of sense and avoid technologies, as envisioned in the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). The Challenge prize purse is currently targeted for $500,000.	NASA may, in its discretion, augment or reduce the prize purse, or may expand or contract the scope of the Challenge, or may decide to postpone or cancel the Challenge, based on the responses received to this NOTICE or for other reasons in its reasonable discretion.	All activities by NASA under or pursuant to the Challenge are subject to the availability of appropriated funds. SELECTION CRITERIA NASA will select Allied Organization(s) based on the following evaluation criteria as appropriate to the areas proposed: 1)	Capabilities of the organization to administer the Challenge and competition events including ability to: a.	publicize and promote the goals of the Challenge through creative use of public media including websites. b.	encourage the participation of individuals, groups, students, and businesses, especially those outside the traditional aerospace community and those from minority and under-represented communities so as to attract a diverse field of competitors with wide geographic distribution. c.	conduct competition events safely and impartially. d.	formulate and finalize competition rules, judging criteria, and competition plans in consultation with NASA and with appropriate public comment. e.	provide, as necessary, appropriate competition venues and supporting equipment. f.	access technical expertise in the area of the Challenge and select qualified and impartial judges.  g.	conduct competitor registration and establish agreements with competitors covering legal, insurance, and other issues. h.	maintain communication with competitors and with NASA. i.	organize ancillary activities, including parallel student-class competitions (university, high school, or other levels) to enhance and broaden the impact of the Challenge. j.	Report competition results to NASA and to the public. k.	collect and report to NASA data on competitor progress and performance. l.	access funds and other resources required to successfully execute these Challenge requirements. 2)	Experience of the organization in similar or analogous activities that demonstrate competence, integrity, commitment to safety, and ability to work cooperatively in partnering arrangements. 3)	Ability of the organization to support Challenge administration through internal financial resources or firm commitments of sponsors.  Existing financial resources or sponsor commitments will be a positive factor in evaluation of proposals. PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS Responses to this NOTICE should not be more than fifteen pages in length, not including any letters of commitment from sponsoring or partner organizations.  Pages in excess of the page limitations for each section will not be evaluated. A page is defined as one (1) sheet 8 1/2 x 11 inches using a minimum of 12-point font size for text and 8-point for graphs.  Proposals should not include proprietary information.

<p><strong>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE. THIS IS STRICTLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH.</strong></p>
<strong>Background</strong><br />The Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is re-competing a full and open contract for support services for feasibility projects, pilot studies, methodologic studies, specialized tasks in large scale studies, full scale support for cross-sectional, cohort and case-control studies.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Studies within HREB importantly focus on sex differences in cancer etiology and address risk factors for some of the most prevalent gender-specific cancers of men (prostate, testis) and women (breast, endometrium, ovarian, cervix). In addition, efforts are placed on clarifying the etiology of a number of rare cancers (e.g., liver cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, male breast cancer). <br /><br />To achieve its goals, HREB's approach has been to (1) integrate risk factor information with many different biologic markers into interdisciplinary molecular epidemiologic investigations to understand a variety of exposures as related to multiple cancers and gain insights into mechanisms that mediate risk factors; (2) to sub-divide tumors into etiologically and prognostically distinct entities; (3) examine natural history of and progression for cancer precursors; (4) address rapidly emerging issues in cancer epidemiology through novel investigations of poorly understood risk factors and under-studied hormonal and reproductive cancers; and (5) assist in training the next generation of hormonal, reproductive, and molecular epidemiologists.<br /><br />The philosophical focus of HREB studies&nbsp;is to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that relate carefully defined exposure assessments to specific outcomes to provide new insights into cancer etiology, hormonal carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. Molecular approaches play a critical and increasingly important role in HREB studies. Approximately fifteen studies will likely receive support under the contract.<br /><strong><br />Project Requirement<br /></strong>This support services contract is essential for HREB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate risk factor information with many different biologic markers to provide new insights into cancer etiology and mechanisms of action. The NCI/HREB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for all phases of epidemiologic studies, including support for pilot and feasibility efforts to assess capabilities for launching multidisciplinary studies, development of precise methods of defining exposures to identify new causes of cancer and to adequately characterize the shape of the exposure-response relationship, and to understand the interaction of genetic and environmental factors related to cancer risk. Thus, the support services contract will need to provide staff with superb logistical skills, knowledge of epidemiological studies and diverse biological specimens, and appreciation of specimen collection and handling requirements in order to enable technologically sophisticated assay development and performance. The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, and pilot) studies. <br /><br />The scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the HREB professional staff. The successful Contractor shall be able to complete the following tasks:<br /><br />1) obtain necessary information to determine effective study resources (e.g., capabilities of collaborating institutions, numbers of eligible study subjects, exposure information, etc.) and prepare, pretest, evaluate and produce data collection forms and specifications manuals, including computer-assisted questionnaires; <br /><br />2) assist in the coordination of multi-center studies and facilitate cooperation between NCI and its collaborators; <br /><br />3) prepare training programs and materials for abstractors, interviewers and other study personnel and procedure manuals; <br /><br />4) arrange for the collection, handling, transport and storage of biologic and environmental samples; <br /><br />5) validate cancer incidence and cause of death by obtaining medical records and death certificates, and have them coded by appropriate nosologists, pathologists or clinicians; <br /><br />6) trace study subjects to locate them for interview or biologic specimen collection, to determine their vital status, to evaluate environmental and genetic susceptibility, or to obtain other information necessary for the study; <br /><br />7) hire, train and supervise abstractors, interviewers, telephone screeners, coders, phlebotomists and others who will be involved with acquiring and assembling data; abstract, scan, photocopy or obtain computer records (clinical or office medical records, hospital charts, pathology reports, death certificates etc.); <br /><br />8) interview subjects or surrogates using mail, telephone, computer-assisted or personal interviews; <br /><br />9) assist in evaluating the feasibility of integrating specific molecular components into planned epidemiologic studies; <br /><br />10) act as a clinical liaison for collection of clinical specimens for pilot or other efforts; <br /><br />11) arrange for laboratory evaluation of biologic material; <br /><br />12) arrange for collection and delivery of biologic or environmental samples to <br />laboratories or individuals for storage and/or analysis; <br /><br />13) enter coded information into suitable computers; <br /><br />14) design and maintain computer databases and associated reporting software and prepare edit programs, edit data, and correct computer files where necessary; prepare analytical data files as requested by HREB staff; <br /><br />15) document each step of a study and maintain, in an orderly arrangement, all relevant material so that any aspect of the study may be reviewed and evaluated by the NCI staff at any point in time; <br /><br />16) develop subcontracts for conducting field studies outside the U.S., for specialized field procedures in the U.S., and for laboratory analyses of biologic samples. <br /><br /><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance<br /></strong>It is anticipated that the ordering period for this Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be 60 months. Task Orders may extend beyond the 60 month contract period.<br /><strong><br />Capability Statement/Information Sought<br /></strong>To be deemed capable of providing the current need for the study, the offeror shall submit a written capability statement demonstrating the ability and experience in performing the requirements noted in this notice. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will evaluated by the experience and expertise in conducting and managing small and large epidemiological studies (domestic and international) that integrate risk factor information with many different biologic markers. Offerors should demonstrate past performance and expertise in (1) providing organization and staffing to ensure efficient planning, initiation, implementation, conduct, and completion of small and large epidemiological studies (domestic and international) and (2) coordinating and managing, either directly or through subcontract mechanisms, the conduct of specialized field studies both within and outside of the U.S.; and (3) collection, processing, storage, transport and arranging for technologically sophisticated laboratory analyses of biologic samples.<br /><br /><strong>Submission Information<br /></strong>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, not to exceed 15 single-sided pages (including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above.

<DESC>This notice is a request for information (RFI) and is not a request for proposals (RFP). The government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released. In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.
<p>Description</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of the Director (OD), Office of Extramural Research (OER), Office of Extramural Programs (OEP) is seeking market research potential sources, and best practice information and cost estimates for initial design and development and possibly maintenance, for an IT program with the following features and capabilities:</p>
<p>This program is intended to be used:<br />a) To obtain information on staff knowledge and gaps of knowledge on a particular area of interest;<br />b) To provide information and learning opportunities to staff on the particular area of interest; <br />c) To provide opportunities of self-evaluation for individual staff on the particular area of interest; and<br />d) To track progress of staff knowledge, individually and institution-wide, over time.</p>
<p>The desired program will be:<br />a) One that can be uploaded to an existing website to be accessed by staff using the usual login ID. <br />b) An initial introductory screen will appear to provide staff with basic information. Three choices will appear here: 1) link to take them to another site on the same website, 2) selection to proceed further; 3) exit back to the website homepage. <br />c) Staff selecting option 2 will then be asked a couple of &lsquo;demographic' questions (i.e. their job nature - 4 selections, and their NIH institution - 26 selections) to determine which category of staff and which NIH institution they belong to. This will be followed by "the challenge", a series of 9 or 12 questions which they will answer within a certain period of time. <br />d) The questions will be drawn randomly from a pool of preloaded questions divided into 3 groups so that there will be equal number of questions drawn from each group. <br />e) After each response, staff will be provided information on what the correct answer was and why, regardless of their response. Staff will score one point if the correct answer was given. Staff cannot go back to previous questions to correct their answers.<br />f) At the end of "the challenge", staff will be provided a final score and a summary of the questions they answered with the correct answers for review. There will be facility to print this summary. <br />g) Staff's login ID will be used to track progress of the staff's performance over time. If staff has completed previous "challenges", then those scores will also be provided for their review in the summary provided in f) above.<br />h) Since the questions will be selected randomly from a large enough pool, the series of questions generated for each "challenge" will be sufficiently different each time to maintain freshness and interest. <br />The data/statistics expected from the system:<br />a) Percentages of times a particular question is scored correctly and incorrectly with tracking over time.<br />b) Staff's average scores by demographic category and NIH institution.<br />c) Changes of scores by demographic category, NIH institution, and individual staff over time (say yearly).</p>
<p>Content, in terms of questions and answers, will be provided by our staff and will be preloaded on to the system. While we do not expect any frequent or regular content change, the system should be catered to accept such changes with minimal disturbance to the running of the system.</p>
<p>The development of the system will include limited basic presentation designs.<br />The data and statistics will need to be easily retrievable by our own staff at indeterminate time points. <br />While the system can track staff according to their login ID, it is not expected to provide readily identifiable information of individual staff.</p>
<p>Technical Information:<br />The proposed system is expected to run on Windows 2003 with IIF 6 or 7. <br />It will need to be compatible with Microsoft Sequel 2005 for data storage purpose. <br />It will also need to be able to leverage active directory for authentication.</p>
<p>Submission of Information - Vendors desiring to respond to this request should provide a white paper as follows:</p>
<p>White Paper: Limit the number of pages to four (4) total (Times New Roman, Font 12, one inch margins) excluding cover and photos which can be included separately. Describe sample system or kit including, at a minimum, the specific information of interest stated in the description</p>
<p>To be responsive to this announcement a vendor must supply their information as requested by December 6, 2012 by 2:00 p.m. est., as a Microsoft Word document. The recipient email address is: ebriscoee@mail.nih.gov. Vendors are requested to provide the name of Contact Person for their company, telephone number, FAX number, email and complete address with each submission of data and include NIH-LM-2013-620/EJB Staff Evaluation Program on cover page of White Paper.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health is under no obligation to select any participating technologies. NO TELEPHONE REQUEST WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.
<p>The Government is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisitions Regulation, Part 10 to identify potential sources to provide for the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market. All information submitted in response to this SSN is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately and will be controlled and secured. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health, (NIH), electronic Research Administration (eRA) is conducting this market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified businesses, including small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or HUBZone small businesses capable of providing professional, technical and administrative support. This SSN will determine the interest and feasibility of small business set-asides. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>All responding firms are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business. The anticipated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541611, and the Small Business Standard is $14 million. Teaming arrangements and joint ventures may be considered for any subsequent procurement based on the Government's market research. <br />The eRA is conducting this market research to identify sources that have prime contractor experience in providing IT architecture, business analysis, testing, and configuration management for Federal grants management systems similar in size scope and complexity to eRA. The incumbent contractor currently provides a staff of 50-55 Analysts, Architects, Testers and Configuration Management Specialists. <br />Developed, managed and supported by NIH's Office of Extramural Research, the eRA systems provide information technology solutions and support for the full life cycle of grants administration functions for the NIH as well as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).<br />eRA and its systems manage the receipt, processing, review, award and monitoring of over $30 billion in research and non-research grants awarded annually by NIH and other grantor agencies. eRA systems are used by Federal staff and applicants at over 11,000 institutions worldwide to: <br />&bull; Record, review and process over 80,000 applications each year.<br />&bull; Maintain and support more than 200,000 active grants. <br />&bull; Support nearly 27,000 reviewers and more than 3,500 review meetings held annually. <br />&bull; Administer more than 55,000 awarded competing and non-competing grants.<br />&bull; Maintain patent and invention records for 25 Federal agencies. <br />&bull; Support thousands of applicant interactions with the Federal Government before and after the grant award, through the eRA online interface. <br />eRA systems align with Grants.gov (the one-stop web portal for finding and applying for federal grants), allowing for full electronic processing of grant applications from application submission through closeout of the grant award. eRA systems provide a suite of 28 modules supporting end-to-end grants administration. The entire eRA Enterprise with all of its independent systems shares a common data model, residing within an Oracle database platform. The hardware architecture is a combination of Windows NT and UNIX servers. The application architecture is a web enabled multi-tier J2EE environment. The development activities in the eRA program follow the eRA Software Development Life Cycle methodology which is based on the Department of Health and Human Services Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC).</p>
<p><br />Experience in the following areas apply:</p>
<p>&bull; Providing business and requirements development to support Federal grants management business processes<br />&bull; Providing IT architecture support regarding data, application software, network, and hardware <br />&bull; providing functional and performance testing during the software development lifecycle (SDLC)<br />&bull; Providing configuration management<br />&bull; Providing software design and development support<br />&bull; Providing documentation and training support</p>
<p>Federal grants management system experience as a prime contractor similar in size, scope and complexity to the eRA program is an absolute requirement and a key success indicator. The goal of this procurement is two-fold: (1) to provide a practical solution for eRA system engineering support services for eRA in all program areas (software maintenance, new initiatives, and integration of HHS and other agencies) into one contract, and (2) to meet the needs of the end user community and their expectations for service. The preponderant amount of the work is increasingly maintenance and enhancements of existing systems, and new functionality that spans across multiple systems; therefore, the eRA strategy for accomplishing these goals has been to restructure from individual project teams to a customer focused service team approach.</p>
<p>Below are the characteristics of the eRA systems engineering requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Project Planning Support<br />&bull; Business Analysis and Requirements Development<br />&bull; Application Architecture<br />&bull; System and Integration Testing<br />&bull; Configuration Management<br />&bull; IT Security<br />&bull; Design Support<br />&bull; Software Development Support<br />&bull; Production Support<br />&bull; Documentation Support<br />&bull; Training Support<br />&bull; eRA Infrastructure Support</p>
<p>The eRA expects to conduct a competitive acquisition and award a contract no later than June 30, 2013. The contract type will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee.</p>
<p>Please submit the following information:</p>
<p>Name and address of company and or companies (if there is a teaming arrangement)</p>
<p>1. Corporate capabilities<br />&bull; Federal grants management systems experience<br />&bull; Systems engineering experience similar in scope, size and complexity to eRA.</p>
<p>2. Relevant experience, including:<br />&bull; Contract name<br />&bull; Contracting Agency or Department<br />&bull; Yearly contract value (in $$)<br />&bull; Period of performance<br />&bull; Description of work and how it relates to eRA requirements</p>
<p>Submission requirements:</p>
<p>1. Page limit - three (3) 8 &frac12; x 11 pages<br />2. 1 inch margins (top, bottom and sides)<br />3. Times New Roman font - 12 point<br />4. Page limitation does not include (1 cover page, or 1 letter of introduction page)<br />5. Do not include promotional materials</p>
<p>Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide a capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Governments requirements for the above in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b). The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not exceed 3 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirements above. Please specify one primary and one alternate Point of Contact (POC) within your firm, including telephone numbers and email addresses.</p>
<p>Your capability statement should include a list of up to three customers (Government/non-Government) within the past 5-year highlighting similar work in nature, scope, complexity, and difficulty and a brief description of the scope of work.<br /><br />Only electronic copies of capability statements will be accepted and should be emailed to briscoee@mail.nih.gov. The e-mail shall contain the following subject line: Sources Sought - NIH-LM-2013-621/EJB eRA Systems Engineering Support. A determination by the Government to proceed with the acquisition as a set-aside is within the discretion of the Government. If capability statements are not received from at least two responsible small businesses by the response date or if the Government determines that no small business concerns are capable of performing this requirement based upon an evaluation of the capability statements submitted, the Government may proceed with a full and open competition.</p>
<p>Please submit all information to Em'Ria J. Briscoe at briscoee@mail.nih.gov by December 14, 2012. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<DESC>The Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC), on behalf of the current Coalition Wideband Networking Waveform (COALWNW) program member nations [i.e., Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US)], is seeking information concerning the availability of capable domestic and international industry vendors to provide Software Defined Radio (SDR) Waveform (WF) Applications that can successfully support secure, wideband coalition connectivity for these nations. COALWNW was established in 2009 between the program member nations in recognition of the need for a multinational SDR networking WF solution to support secure coalition operations. The program is structured into three phases: Phase 1 defined the COALWNW requirement and technical specifications; Phase 2 will procure a WF (that may be ported to national platforms) and reference implementation; and Phase 3 will focus on cooperative interoperability testing of the WF against the reference implementation, and planning for WF sustainment. In preparation for Phase 2, the COALWNW program member nations request domestic and international industry vendors review and comment on Government-provided information as detailed in the attachment to this RFI. This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the US Government, or the government of any COALWNW program member nation, to acquire any products or services. Any information provided in response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the US Government or the government of any COALWNW program member nation. Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. At this point, the COALWNW program member nations are only interested in identifying interested and capable industry vendors to verify the technical feasibility of the draft COALWNW SS and IAIRS documents, and review and comment on the Government-provided information detailed in the attachment to this RFI.

Thus, responses received after a reasonable expectation is determined, and before the RFI response date, will have no bearing on the set-aside decision. <br />Potential sources are invited to submit a Capabilities Statement up to 3 pages for responses, as described above, to the "RFI OUSD(I) - Specialized Staff Support - Director of Security  ".

<DESC>SOLE SOURCE AWARD ANNOUNCEMENT AND JUSTIFICATION POSTING.
PER FAR PART 6.302-1 AND 6.302-2, AND THE JUSTIFICATION BELOW, THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION IS ISSUING THIS SOLE SOURCE AWARD TO AVANTSTAR INC, 18872 LAKE DR E, CHANHASSEN MN, 55317, FOR THE AVANTSTAR QUICK VIEW 12 STANDARD SOFTWARE.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Solicitation No.: N/A Project Name: Avantstar Quick View Standard Software and Maintenance
In accordance with FAR 6.302, the proposed contractual action is pursuant to the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) & (2). 1. Agency and Contracting Activity: PN Region, Boise ID.
2. Nature/Description of Action: A Firm Fixed Price procurement for this software is being requested. Funding will be FY13, NTE $33,000.00
3. Description of Supplies/Services: Quick View Plus 12 is the solution for preserving legacy e-mail messaging content.  Message files must remain and be accessible in their native format for litigation purposes.  The estimated value of this procurement is $32,265.00. Due to the recent efforts to fast tract implementation of a unified department wide messaging system (Bison Connect) has created an urgent need to preserve our existing legacy messaging content and acceptable e-Discovery FOIA acceptable formats.  Bison Connect uses completely dissimilar and incompatible technology with our existing legacy messaging system. The PN Region was unaware, until very recently, that no effort had been made by DOI to ensure the archiving of the legacy system. Upon realizing this shortcoming the Technical Team began a search for programs that would, at a minimum, address the following critical criteria:  - Read and access Outlook *.msg files and associated attachments pre and post Google migration - Maintain *.msg files in their native format for litigation purposes     - if we were to convert all *.msg files to a different format for accessibility, we would still have to keep the       original file resulting in a duplication of storage - Maintain orginial structure of *.msg file with associated attachments - Security - User interface must run in least user privilege    - Conversion and/or viewing must not require administrative access to function - Product must be stable and reliable    - Attachments and message must be accessible.
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and compelling urgency
5. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications: This software will allow the Government the ability to archive the current e-mail system and messages once Bison Connect is deployed on December 7, 2012.  If this software is not in place prior to deployment, any information stored in the current system will be unavailable for any FOIA requests or litigation issues. Avantstar Inc produces software specifically for legal case management, litigation support, eDiscovery, computer forensics and advanced enterprise and government file viewing requirements. Since 2001, Avantstar has focused on solving digital content viewing and content management issues for government agencies. A delay in the purchase of this software would be detrimental, as the PN Region would lose the archiving capability with the current e-mail system. Quick View Plus can view content from more than 300 different programs and saves the government the considerable expense of buying unnecessary programs just to view content. A government organization with 1000 employees could save well over $250,000 in software licensing costs. And when standardized on Quick View Plus as the file viewing program, the government is protected from damaging macro viruses. 6. Description of efforts made to maximize competition: As soon as it was discovered that additional software was going to be needed for the conversion, a technical team was assembled to explore third party products to allow preservation of existing content.  4 separate programs were reviewed and tested: Neevia, Birdie MSG, Adobe Acrobat and Avantstar. As a result of their technical review, the Avantstar Quick View product was the only product that was able to address and meet ALL of the critical technical needs.  
7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost: The vendor was contacted for a cost estimate for the product licenses required and the maintenance of the software for 1 year. The cost given by Avantstar for 1200 licenses and support and maintenance for 1300 licenses (the PN Region already has 100 licenses), the cost was $26.55 per new license, support and maintenance included in the price.  The total cost for this requirement is $32,265.00.  When using Avantstar's website to 'order' the same products the cost was $40.00 per new license when purchased in a bundle of 50 (support and maintenance included), or $49.00 individually with support and maintenance separate.  A single license for Adobe Acrobat 10 Pro is $179.00 with 12 months support and maintenance for $74.48. Birdie MSG Software is $49.00 per license with online chat support included. Neevia Technology offers a 10 license pack for $2,999.00 with $99.00 for annual support and maintenance.  NOTE: Regarding pricing for Adobe, Birdie andNeevia, it is understood that discounts may be offered for the large quantity order, this comparison is based off of published retail pricing.

8. Description of Market Research Conducted: An initial market research was conducted by the customer confirming that the product was indeed a commercial item, using the World Wide Web, and viewing the pricing and companies that supplied similar products. The Reclamation Enterprise Messaging Team found four different software programs that addressed our need for working with .MSG files after the conversion: Neevia, Adobe Professional, Birdie Converter and Avantstar Quick View.  The Contracting Officer also conducted a market research to find available software for this requirement, and found the same companies. Further, there were several software programs that were analyzed by a technical team that found only the Avantstar program to meet our critical needs.  The company was contacted to see if they had any resellers that could be used for competition, and per an e-mail that was received on 11/19/2012, Avantstar does not have any resellers, and only sells direct to government entities (see attached). Some of the other software companies found by the Contracting Officer include Oracle, TeamViewer, UVNC, Informative Graphics Corp, and Disk Size Explorer. Many of these have the main purpose of file management or document mark-up, rather than being an archive tool to a defunct e-mail program. Due to the security restrictions set on the government computer, UVNC and TeamViewer were unable to be viewed by the Contracting Officer. GSA Advantage was searched for MSG Document Converter software, and while there were document converter programs available, the main function was to convert PDF documents into searchable digital files, rather than integrate into a legacy e-mail system such as Outlook in order to archive pertinent documents.
9. Any Other Supporting Facts:   Under 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Circumstances, if this software isn't purchased and installed prior to the Bison Connect Deployment on 7 December, 2012, the Bureau of Reclamation will lose the archive ability for their Outlook e-mail. Due to the requirement to save documentation for any litigation possibility, this would be a detriment to the Government. A technical team has already spent the time reviewing numerous products, this is a time sensitive project, and valuable data (e-Discovery, FOIA, litigation materials) will be lost when the new Bison Connect is implemented on 12/07/12.
10. Listing of Interested Sources:  N/A
11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition: With this implementation, it has been explained to the IT Department that at least two months is required to ensure a proper acquisition timeline for adequate competition.  While it was discovered through the market research done by the technical team that Avantstar software is the best fit for the needs of the government and was the only software of the four tested to meet ALL critical needs of the government, it was very obvious that there are other software publishers that MAY be able to be competitive.  In the future, when an implementation is announced, the IT Department has been advised to do everything it can to ensure that a need like this will be addressed to make sure that proper competition is sought if the need arises.

<DESC>U.S. Department of Energy Office of Headquarters Procurement Services
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 	 The Office of Headquarters Procurement Services of the Department of Energy (DOE) plans to contract by means other than full and open competition.  This is a sole source acquisition without full and open competition.  The circumstances permitting other than full and open competition are prescribed in FAR 6.302-1, One Responsible Source, under the authority of the Competition in Contracting Act, 41 U.S.C. ? 3304(a)(1).
This contract will provide a continuation of critical legal services for the Loan Programs Office (LPO) to advise LPO in connection with the Stephentown Spindle, LLC (Spindle) loan agreement in order to protect the Government?s investment of approximately $25 million in this domestic flywheel-based frequency regulation plant in order to minimize any loss and proactively take prudent and orderly steps to protect its investment in a cost-efficient manner.  Specifically, the services and expertise of legal advisor, Nixon Peabody LLP, are necessary to participate in negotiating, structuring, documenting, and closing any amendments, modifications and waivers to the existing loan, including in restructuring, defaults, insolvencies, and bankruptcy contexts, and providing related advice and representation in such contexts.  The estimated term of this contract is not to exceed 18 months at a total ceiling price of $450,000.  Nixon Peabody LLP is the incumbent contractor that represent ed DOE in the negotiation of the original loan guarantee agreement, as well as the Spindle loan agreement which resulted from the restructuring in the bankruptcy of the original borrower, Stephentown Regulation Services, LLC (?SRS?).  Nixon Peabody LLP possesses the necessary skills, staffing and expertise to assist LPO with no loss of time and added expense that would occur if a new firm were brought on to provide the services.  Nixon Peabody LLP is uniquely situated to provide these professional legal services to the LPO because it has previously provided transactional legal services to LPO for the original loan guarantee, as well as the promissory note (the Note) transaction with the Spindle project; and is therefore most proficient with the workings and particulars of the transaction documentation.  No other law firm would currently be capable of providing the services sought by the LPO at the necessary level of expertise, including detailed knowledge of existing contrac tual arrangements.  The timing of this acquisition is such that award of this contract based on full and open competition is precluded because there is an immediate need for these specialized professional legal services, and only Nixon Peabody LLP, the incumbent contractor, has the capability to provide the services at the necessary level of expertise. The inherent delay in conducting a full and open competition for the specialized professional legal services could put at risk the Government?s ability to protect its interests, which are approximately $25 million.  Because Nixon Peabody LLP is uniquely qualified to provide these services, a full and open competition would not be in the government?s best interests.

<SUBJECT>SURFACE CONNECTOR (X), RECAPITALIZATION OF THE US NAVY LANDING CRAFT UTILITY (LCU) 1600 CLASS INDUSTRY DAY
<SOLNBR>N0002413SN02A
<ARCHDATE>02282013
<CONTACT>
<DESC>This Special Notice is a follow-up to N0002412SNA72 dated 1 August 2012.

THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH AND WILL BE USED FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT MAY OR MAY NOT TRANSLATE INTO AN ACTUAL PROCUREMENT(S) IN FUTURE YEARS.  THERE IS NO FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) seeks to identify parties having both the interest and the resources to support a potential future program which will recapitalize the Navys utility landing craft (LCU).  Therefore, NAVSEA will conduct an Industry Day at the International WorkBoat Show as part of the WorkBoat Professional Series at the Ernest N.
 Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, Louisiana on December 6, 2012 from 1215 to 1300 local time.   A copy of the Industry Day presentation will be posted to FedBizOpps no later than 14 December 2012; however, the Government makes no representation that the information contained in the posted presentation was the only information that was presented.  No audio recording of the presentation will be provided.

The Government anticipates that additional Industry Days will occur at times and locations to be determined.

Interested parties may view information regarding how to register and attend the International WorkBoat Show at  www.workboatshow.com.

LCUs provide the Navys amphibious ships with an organic capability to move heavier equipment and forces than aircraft or air-cushioned vessels between ship and shore in a reliable, fuel efficient manner.
  Although designed for a 25 year service life, the existing LCUs have been operational for an average of 40 years.  As they reach the end of their extended operational service life, shortfalls will exist in amphibious ship-to-shore lift that exacerbate the challenges of supporting delivery of troops, cargo and equipment on unimproved beaches or shallow ports to support a variety of missions.  This will exacerbate the inherent challenges and limitations of supporting ship-to-shore movement and operations across the Range of Military Operations on unimproved beaches and in diverse coastal environments.   

The Navy is planning to replace the LCU.  This future surface connector (originally called LCU (Recapitalization)) program is intended to replace the capability provided by the LCU 1600 Class as designed.
  This Industry Day presentation will articulate the need, describe the capability to be replaced, and present the current status of the future surface connector acquisition program.

NOTICES REGARDING SOLICITATION:  Presentation of an Industry Day does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment, implied or otherwise, by the Government that a procurement action will be issued.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted and requests for solicitation packages will not be honored, as no solicitation is intended at this time.  Response to this notice is not a request to be added to a bidders list or to receive a copy of a solicitation.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THIS SPECIAL NOTICE.

The Government may not respond to any specific questions or comments submitted in response to this special notice or the Industry Day presentation.
  Any information submitted by respondents as a result of this notice is strictly voluntary.  

No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result any attendance at the Industry Day.  

Future information on the Surface Connector (X) regarding Industry Days or other events will be posted at the websites for FBO and NECO (www.neco.navy.mil), the same sites where this announcement has been posted.

The Government intends to issue a modification to contract N00164-10-D-WS25 which was awarded on a sole source basis.  The required supplies and services covered under this contract are for spares manufacturing, repairs, upgrades, modifications and engineering services for CIOPs and associated CIOP Flash Drive Cartridges that control both the AN/USQ-113A(V)3 and (V)4 Radio Countermeasures Set and the AN/AAQ-28 LITENING Advanced Targeting (AT) Pod used on the U.S.
 Navys EA-6B Prowler Tactical Aircraft. Parvus Corporation, UT is the original equipment manufacturer of the CIOCP.  This modification will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by F.A.R. 6.302-1.  As the sole designer and manufacturer of the Improved Operator Control Panel, AN/USQ-113A(V)3 and Common Improved Operator Control Panel (CIOCP), AN/USQ-113A(V)4. Parvus Corporation is the only qualified source who has the unique corporate knowledge of IOCP and CIOCP manufacturing processes, design complexities, and operational requirements.  Parvus Corporation has the engineering expertise, tooling, facilities, and in-depth knowledge to fulfill the Governments requirement for testing and building IOCP and CIOCP assemblies within program schedules and budget constraints.
  Parvus Corporation owns test equipment, test procedures, software knowledge, and Automated Test Procedures needed.  This equipment is in support of the EA-6B, Prowler, currently deployed in theater of operations and must integrate with existing equipment in terms of form, fit, function, and compatibility.  The Government has attempted to purchase the Product Drawings/Models and Associated Lists and data rights.  Due to the proprietary nature of the internal components of the IOCP and CIOCP, Parvus Corporation is unwilling to sell the Product Drawing/Models and associated List and data rights in order to allow for full and open competition.  Any source other than Parvus Corporation would have to design and develop a new system in order to meet the requirements causing significant time delays and incur additional cost.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 7 years, and 4 weeks after 11 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p><br />THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PRICE. FACTOR #2: DELIVERY. PRICE AND DELIVERY ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 14 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 14 days, required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>As identified in Question Submission, "questions not received in a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered" are defined FOR THIS SOLICITATION as: THE CUTOFF TIME FOR RECEIPT OF QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SOLICITATION IS 11/27/2012. ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>RFP 225198 <br />One X-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System<br />November 21, 2012
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program has been operating zenith pointing cloud radars at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF) for over a decade. These radars, operating in the Ka and W bands, have provided years of invaluable data pertaining to cloud structure and dynamics. However, vertically pointing radars have their limitations in that only a two dimensional view of the cloud is obtained. Millimeter wave radars are also poor precipitation radars since they saturate in light rain and experience excessive atmospheric loss due to atmospheric liquid water.</p>
<p>As part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARM procured four X-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radars (XSAPRs). Three are located at ARM's SGP site in Oklahoma and a fourth is located at ARM's site in Barrow, Alaska. To differentiate between the previously delivered XSAPRs and the new XSAPRs being procured by this specification, the new radars are referred to as XSAPR-2.</p>
<p>The Technical Specification outlines the minimum requirements necessary to meet ARM's science goals with the XSAPR-2 and the associated infrastructure to install XSAPR-2 at the ARM site on Graciosa Island in the Azores.</p>
<p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) acting under Prime Contract DE-AC05-76RL01830 with the US Department of Energy (DOE), for the management, operation and maintenance of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, is interested in receiving a proposals for one X-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System, delivered and installed in the Azores, Portugal.</p>

<DESC>This is a non-competitive combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT57-13-Q-80008 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13and FAR Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61, effective October 15, 2012. The NAICS Code is 541611 and the Small Business size standard is $14 million. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order on a sole source basis to Cahill Swift, LLC, Boston, MA, to organize and deliver one-day seminars that will provide essential information to facilitate Federal Transit Administration covered employers' compliance with the drug and alcohol testing regulations (49CFR Part 655 and Part 40) in accordance with the Statement of Work below.
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK (Begin)</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 requires drug and alcohol testing of safety-sensitive transportation employees in aviation, trucking, railroads, mass transit, pipelines and other transportation industries. DOT publishes rules on who must conduct drug and alcohol tests, how to conduct those tests and what procedures to use when testing. These regulations cover all transportation employers, safety-sensitive transportation employees and service agents - roughly 12.1 million people.</p>
<p>The mission of FTA is to ensure that the drug and alcohol testing policies and goals of the Secretary of Transportation are developed and carried out in a consistent, efficient, and effective manner within the transportation industries for the ultimate safety and protection of the traveling public. FTA has tasked the Volpe Center to assist in meeting these goals. This is partially accomplished through the provision of training by the Volpe Center to assist FTA grantees, state DOTs, sub-recipients, safety-sensitive contractors, FTA-covered employers, vendors and others in understanding to the greatest extent possible the spirit, letter and law of the drug and alcohol testing regulations (49 CFR Parts 655and 40).</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br /><br />The objective of this effort is to organize and deliver one-day seminars that shall provide essential information to facilitate FTA covered employers' compliance with the drug and alcohol testing regulations (49 CFR Part 655 and Part 40). The seminars will focus, in particular, especially on recent revisions to 49 CFR Part 40 (Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs), FTA Drug and Alcohol Compliance Audit procedures and concerns with DOT qualified collectors and collection sites.</p>
<p>The contractor is not responsible for determining or procuring the training venue. The Contractor shall provide the necessary staff, laptop and if necessary, customized MS-PowerPoint presentation to perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>The following list details the required specifications of the Drug and Alcohol Testing Regulations One-Day Seminars.</p>
<p>1. Conference Preparation Location selection collaboration<br />b. Presentation preparation<br />c. Training material development<br />d. Travel</p>
<p>2. One-Day Training and Post-Training Q&amp;A<br />a. Training sessions <br />b. Q&amp;A and Policy Review</p>
<p>Task 1. Seminar Preparation and Travel</p>
<p>The Volpe Center will identify the host, location and specific date for each of 12 seminars. The Volpe Center will provide the Contractor with each individual location, host and schedule information six weeks prior to the seminar date. The Volpe Center, will collaborate with each host to identify potential attendees within the seminar proximity, and will make attempts to contact those employers or individuals and issue invitations to them. The Contractor and Volpe shall, through discussions with the host, identify specific areas of training needed and will customize the training to cover these requirements. The Contractor shall use the FTA-approved MS-PowerPoint presentation as the main training tool.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall revise the FTA-approved MS-PowerPoint presentation as necessary to include these areas of identified needs. The Contractor shall submit the revised MS-PowerPoint presentation to Volpe for review and approval by e-mail, ten days prior to the scheduled seminar date. The presentation will be revised per Volpe Center comments, at least seven days prior to the date of the seminar.</p>
<p>Task 2. Twelve One-Day Training Seminars and Post-Training Q&amp;A</p>
<p>Each seminar will commence at 9:00 a.m. and conclude at 4:00 p.m. and will include 15-minute morning and afternoon breaks and a 60-minute lunch break. At 4:00 p.m., the Contractor will be available, at the seminar site, for a 30-minute informal Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) session. The seminar will include a detailed review of recent regulatory revisions, a review of the FTA drug and alcohol compliance audit process and a description of the most common errors, as determined through the compliance audits, including collection site issues.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall collaborate with Volpe Center staff to identify those issues identified through discussions with the individual seminar hosts and attendees that most dramatically impact transit safety. This report will be issued to FTA through the Volpe Center one week following each seminar.</p>
<p>3.0 DELIVERABLES AND SCHEDULE <br />(See Attachment No.1 for deliverables and schedule table)</p>
<p>4.0 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br /><br />From date of award through January 31, 2013.</p>

<p>The contractor shall make travel arrangements collaboratively with Volpe Center Staff. The contractor will be responsible for all travel costs associated with the contractor staff. It will be necessary in most cases for the Contractor to travel to the training site the day before the presentation.</p>
<p>The Volpe Center will identify the host organization, seminar location and determine the specific date of training for each of the 12 seminars. The Volpe Center will provide this information to the Contractor a minimum of 6 weeks prior to the date of the seminar. Host organizations and seminar locations will be restricted to CONUS and outside CONUS non-foreign locations. When the Volpe Center deems necessary, the Contractor shall rent an automobile for travel from the hotel to the seminar location and from the hotel to the airport. The car rental requirement will be provided to the contractor, if necessary, 30 days prior to the seminar.</p>

Technical Approach and Capability is considered to be more important than Past Performance; however when combined they are significantly more important than price. As the Technical and Management Approach and Relevant Past Performance ratings converge, price may become more important<br />The USCG will evaluate the offers that meet the requirements of the solicitation against the following evaluation criteria: <br />Factor 1: Technical Approach &amp; Capability</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate each offeror's technical approach and capability to determine their capacity to meet all the requirements outlined in the PWS this will include the evaluation of the understanding of the Statement of Work. An evaluation of the course description or syllabus to determine that all sections of the requirements have been met and the resumes' of personnel designated Key in HSAR 3052.215-70 meet with the requirements set forth in Section 1.3.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Relevant Past Performance</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the past performance of the offeror for relevancy. The offeror shall provide past performance information for services directly related and relevant to the services to be performed under the PWS. To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three years. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information submitted with the proposals received in conducting the evaluation. A Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral rating. The USCG may consider past performance information regarding predecessor companies or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is considered relevant.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness.</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>1.3.5 Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons. The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from USCG facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Removal does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue providing the services required under any task order awarded under this contract.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Worldwide</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p><br />With this solicitation, OTI intends to hire a Program Advisor for its Haiti team, initially serving temporary duty on the Haiti Recovery Initiative.  After a time with the Haiti team, at the discretion of the supervisor, there may be additional opportunities to work with other Regional Teams within OTI.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as "bullpenners," providing support in a surge capacity when needed by OTI.  Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in the field and in Washington, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Program Advisor worldwide is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID, including implementing partners in the field. The incumbent is both a team player and independent, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.</p>
<p>The Program Advisor worldwide position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations management in headquarters and the field to provide ad hoc support for program implementation support (e.g. assessments, country start up and close-out, budgeting, support for program funded staff), as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The majority of the workload of this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on his or her own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Program Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD) or his/her designee, the Program Advisor will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in Washington, DC and the field, which, if required, includes travel to difficult posts overseas for extended periods of time;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide support to new OTI country program start-ups, including providing training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support country programs, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field or in Washington, being prepared to travel to difficult posts overseas for extended periods of time if required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. Ensure completion of OTI project budgeting and contracting action needs;</p>
<p>&bull;	When assisting a country program in the field, the incumbent will support the effective implementation of the country program at the local level by ensuring activities are coordinated and integrated with the broader program goals and other USAID and relevant international donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support implementation and management of assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate in the design and implementation of new country program operations, including but not limited to management, logistical, budget, administrative, personnel and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in the drafting of internal and external reports, and special write-ups or information packets as needed;</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate in country analysis, program design and/or assessments to develop existing and future programs and strategies;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and/or participate in the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and personal services contractors;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required for OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in responding to requests for information and taskers regarding OTI programs from within and outside the Agency;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required by the OTI Country team, represent OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, serve as a liaison or provide support for other Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) offices, other USAID divisions, the U.S. Department of State, or other US Agencies on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor and/or designee to help ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The OTI Program Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division or his/her designee, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee when in the field.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p><br />Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <br />(n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession. <br />(o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract. <br />(p) Limitation of liability. Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the Contractor will not be liable to the Government for consequential damages resulting from any defect or deficiencies in accepted items. <br />(q) Other compliances.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.216-18 Ordering. <br />ORDERING (OCT 1995) <br />(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule.

The contract shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after THE LAST DAY OF THE EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. <br />(End of clause) <br />52.217-8 Option to Extend Services. <br />OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999) <br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.

<p><br />52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods.<br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.<br />The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are:<br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventative measures as advised by the public health service.<br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all position performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option.<br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or emergency.<br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan.<br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements.<br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate.<br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work.<br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties.<br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.<br />It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for the critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions," May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2, Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.<br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>2852.223-70 UNSAFE CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS<br />Unsafe Conditions Due to the Presence of Hazardous Material (JUN 1996)<br />(a) "Unsafe condition" as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or Government employees to a hazardous material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working condition designated by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls.<br />(b) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to appraise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.<br />(c) Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working.<br />(d) If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, discovers the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee, (with written notice provided not later than three (3) working days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.<br />(e) When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(f) Notice contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.<br />[End of Clause]</p>

The Agency Protest Official will not consider appeals from the Contracting Officer's decision on an agency protest.<br />(e) The deciding official must conduct a scheduling conference with the protestor within five (5) days after the protest is filed. The scheduling conference will establish deadlines for oral or written arguments in support of the agency protest and for many officials to present information in response to the protest issues.

The Department of Justice will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.<br />(i) The Department of Justice will stay award or suspend contract Performance in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). The stay or suspension unless over-ridden, remains in effect until the protest is decided, dismissed, or withdrawn.<br />(j) The deciding official will make a best effort to issue a decision on the protest within twenty (20) days after the filing date.

<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a<br />twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. <br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D.

At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause.

For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein.

Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition.

When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

PRICE AND DELIVERY ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>New - initial acceptance will be at the discretion of the acceptor during the delivery. All items required must be fully functional, present, and compatible as required by the SOW. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 60 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 60 days or less after receipt of order (ARO). The offeror must provide within its offer the number of days - not to exceed 60 - required to make delivery after it receives a purchase order from the buyer. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING IS PROVIDED TO ALL PROPOSECTIVE RESPONDERS TO THIS RFI NNC13ZMX001L FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES. 1)   NASA is actively soliciting responses from all parties interested.  NASA will utilize these responses to enhance future cargo mission planning for the Space Launch System (SLS) Program.  The current manifest does not have a cargo flight until 2029; however, NASA is exploring ideas for early capability as well as planning for long term cargo capability. 2) Adaption of existing Payload Fairings interface definition:	The 5 meter fairing attachment is made at the aft ring a payload adapter, that is attached to the forward skirt of the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS).  NASA is looking for the interface recommendations with regards to this interface. 3) Adaption of existing Payload Fairings structural capabilities for the SLS ICPS forward interface:  NASA is interested in the load the fairing reacts on the adapter at this interface.  NASA will use whatever information that is available to affect the future planning both on the fairing and the adapter. 4) Interface definition of the 8.4 fairing:  The figures in the RFI are notional and NASA is looking for recommendations by the commercial sector on the best way to interface the fairing to the base of the Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter (LVSA). 5) Engineering Cost Estimate (ECE) for each line Item:	NASA is asking for an ECE for each sub-item called out in the ECE portion of sections 3-5.  Thus in sections 3.7, 4.7, and 5.7 we are requesting ECE's for items (a) through (f), respectively.  NASA welcomes whatever input they choose to provide. 6)  SLS launch operations and process flow: Although NASA currently has notional processing flows, NASA is looking for recommendations from the commercial sector to aid in our future planning of encapsulation and launch vehicle integration.

<DESC><p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The objective of this contract is to provide Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Architectural Engineering services are required to support the Department of Defense Medical (DoDM) program Medical Facilities A-E Services (MFAES) requirements throughout the Contiguous United States (CONUS) and Outside the Contiguous United States (OCONUS). Huntsville Center is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Medical Facilities Mandatory Center of Expertise and Standardization (MX), and partners with the Corps' project delivery teams, regional business centers/divisions, stakeholders and geographical districts to provide medical expertise and the highest quality medical and medical research facility life cycle support to the Department of Defense (DoD), other federal agencies and foreign governments. The A-E contracts are intended to provide a variety of A-E services to include but not limited to: planning, survey, energy conservation and analyses studies, and other investigations/studies; comprehensive interior designs; development of Request For Proposal (RFP); and design services related to new construction, upgrade, maintenance, and repair of various medical facilities, including related infrastructure systems, medical equipment planning and components worldwide. The design of complex healthcare related facilities and laboratories is an integral part of this requirement. The CEHNC Design Manual (CEHNC 1110-1-1) and Unified Facilities Criteria for Medical Military Facilities (UFC 4-510-01) detail the specific design standards and processes associated with this acquisition for planning, design, construction, sustainment, restoration, and modernization criteria. In addition, the UFC Antiterrorism Force Protection Standards must be followed. The A-E firms must be able to provide design considerations for facilities related to healthcare planning. Work may include preparation of design tools, design criteria documents, studies, cost estimates (parametric and quantity take off), interim life safety plans, commissioning plans, facility demolition plans that include hazardous waste identification and removal procedures, concept designs, final designs, construction phase services, and technical review of designs prepared by others. Contractors must have the professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services. In accordance with FAR 52.236-23, Responsibility of the Architect-Engineer Contractor, the A-E Contractor shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the Contractor under this contract. The Contractor shall, without additional compensation, correct or revise any errors or deficiencies in its designs, drawings, specifications, and other services. In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Contractor may perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contracts resulting from the A-E services, however, the A-E contractor will not be responsible for the direct performance of the construction itself.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this objective, the Huntsville Center proposes to award Unrestricted, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) with a portion of the awards reserved for small business concerns. The intent is to award contracts to six responsible firms, three large and three small businesses (SB).

<p>6. All questions regarding this notice or the TABSS procurement shall be directed to the Contracting Officer at TABSS@uscg.mil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />UPDATE 19 (25 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide Amendment 7 and an amended RFP. For additional information, please see below:</p>
<p>(1) The only area amended in the RFP is the hand delivery instructions in Section L-4. Due to the expected high volume of proposals, offerors hand delivering their proposals need to use the loading dock on the T Street Southwest (SW) side of the Jemal Building. Upon arrival at the loading dock area, offerors should go through the brown gate and climb the stairs to enter the building at the loading dock&nbsp;guard desk. Please see the attached map for further information; note that this map is not a part of Amendment 7.</p>
<p>Please also note that the delivery building and address (1900 Half Street SW, Washington, D.C., 20593) are the same as before; only the proposal reception area is being changed.</p>
<p>(2) To reiterate, all proposals are due by 3 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Wednesday, March 2nd, 2011.</p>
<p>All offerors planning to hand deliver proposals before Wednesday, March 2nd, are encouraged to coordinate their proposal deliveries with Nathan Dolezal or with Katherine Powers to ensure proper proposal reception. This coordination can be done via email to Nate.Dolezal@uscg.mil&nbsp;or Katherine.Powers@uscg.mil.</p>
<p>All offerors planning to hand deliver their proposals on Wednesday, March 2nd, are encouraged to plan accordingly due to the aforementioned proposal volume and limited parking at the Jemal Building.</p>
<p>(3) After the government receives the offeror's package, the government will provide a receipt of confirmation. This receipt is provisional pending the package successfully passing the government screening process.</p>
<p>Any offeror who has not received a confirmation receipt or is not in line at the loading dock of the Jemal Building by 3 PM EST will have their proposal considered late.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.<br /><br />UPDATE 18 (17 February 2011)<br /><br />The purpose this update is to provide Amendment 6 and three amended RFP attachments.&nbsp; These documents are located&nbsp;in the lower-right hand side of this page.<br /><br />As described in Amendment 6, the three attachments have been amended as follows: <br /><br />1.) Attachment 3B - A formula error has been fixed.<br /><br />The version of Attachment 3B attached to this amendment shall be used by offerors submitting Domain 2 proposals.<br /><br />2.) Attachment 4 - Typographical errors have been fixed.<br /><br />3.) Attachment 10 - References have been corrected.<br /><br />The RFP and all other RFP attachments are unchanged.<br /><br />Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.<br /><br /><br />UPDATE 17 (11 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the TABSS Q+A Addendum Matrix. It is located in the lower-right hand side of this page.</p>
<p>The Q+A Addendum Matrix has two parts. The first part consists of questions that were received before the TABSS question due date but were accidentally left off of the original TABSS Q+A Matrix. The second part consists of clarifications regarding certain questions from the original TABSS Q+A Matrix.</p>
<p>The government will accept no further questions. Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix will be updated in the future. In the event of a discrepancy between either matrix and the amended RFP, the amended RFP governs.</p>
<p>Neither the TABSS Q+A Matrix nor the Q+A Addendum Matrix are included in any of the TABSS amendments. They are provided as guidance to offerors.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your support of the TABSS procurement.</p>
<p>UPDATE 16 (10 February 2011)</p>
<p>The purpose of this update is to provide the amended RFP and RFP attachments. Of particular note is the amended Attachment 10, "Labor Category Descriptions and Qualifications Matrix," along with the new Attachment 11, "Annual Small Business Subcontracting Compliance Report."</p>
<p>Two copies of the RFP are being provided, an "informational" copy with highlighting and a "conformed" copy without highlighting. In the informational copy, all new changes to the RFP have been highlighted in turquoise. Changes made via Amendment 4 are highlighted in yellow. The content of the two RFPs (both informational and conformed) is identical. Please use the conformed copy in the future.</p>

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components.</p>
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>

(1011 Arlington Blvd. Ste. 375 Arlington, VA 22209) for maintenance and support on 90 NRC-owned ILEX secure facsimiles. These ILEX secure facsimiles are manufactured by L-3 Communications, and OMNI Business Systems-FaxPlus, Inc. is the only authorized reseller/distributor of L-3 products and services in the United States. Should anyone other than an L-3 authorized repair facility work on these secure facsimile machines, warranties would be voided. These units have experienced exceptionally high failure rates, and if no maintenance support is available, NRC Headquarters, NRC Regions, and Resident Inspector Sites will lose the critical capability of transmitting classified information via facsimile to and from these sites.

<DESC>The National Guard Bureau (NGB), an active duty component of the U.S Department of Defense (DoD) and the US Army Reserve (USAR) have the urgent need to provide mental health support services per provision 10 U.S.C., Chapter 55; Section 723, National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2007, Pub. L. 109-163 and the Report of the DoD Task Force on Mental Health (TFMH), June 2007 specifically behavioral health and support services for National Guard (NG) members as part of pre-deployment resiliency training and post deployment reintegration to civilian life. 10 U.S.C., Chapter 55 establishes Federal responsibility for Prevention, Mitigation, and Treatment of Blast Injuries (Pub. L. 109-163 (1) (D), Access to Health Care Services for Beneficiaries Eligible for TRICARE and the Department of Veteran's Affairs Health Care (Pub. L. 107-314, (A), (C) Health Care Management Demonstration Program (Pub. L. 106-398, (a), (b, 1-2),  specifically to improve, develop and maintain intervention and rehabilitation programs for returning troops who have developed post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), experienced traumatic brain injuries (TBI), and/or other behavioral health problems associated with an individual's inability to reintegrate into civilian life.  Some states and local communities currently lack access, coordination and/or professional intervention services of mental health providers and related support systems. The National Guard (NG) faces unique challenges to provide mental health support to its members. NG armories and wings are community based and are seldom within the catchment area of a military treatment facility; and have varying degrees of capabilities between communities and states. Since the Guard does not provide treatment, all care is received externally through TRICARE, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) and health insurance provided through a Guard member's or civilian spouse's civilian employer. Additionally, psychological health is not a core competency of the NG and USAR; resulting in an inconsistency between a state's ability to design and implement a psychological health program. <br> This contract also addresses the recommendations: 5.4.1.6, 5.4.1.10, 5.4.1.11, 5.4.1.12, 5.4.1.14 of the DoD Plan to Achieve the Vision of the DoD Task Force on Mental Health, September 2007 Report to Congress;  quote mark to place a Director of Psychological Health at each of the 54 Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ) quote mark , for Army and Air National Guard service, under direction of the state Adjutant General (TAG) who may appoint a Joint Director for oversight. <br>  <br> To fulfill this mission, the Contractor, in partnership with NGB, will identify behavioral health provider networks of locally based mental health clinicians/counselors who will offer mental health counseling and associated support services for pre and post deployment NG members and their families. In addition, the Contractor will place a Director of Psychological Health in each of the 54 states/territories who will coordinate and manage mental health counseling and resource services and/or oversee qualified providers and other mental health resources within his/her respective state. The NGB COR will provide technical oversight to ensure delivery of professionally sound, standardized and cost-effective services. <br>  <br> The purpose of this contract is the provision of State and Regional Support Command <br> Directors of Psychological Health who will coordinate counseling and/or oversee mental health services to NG and Reserve members located throughout the United States including the Pacific Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wherever Army or Air National Guard members and USAR members and their families are located.  All reintegration support services will complement one another and provide service members with valuable assistance in their management of mild readjustment issues to varying degrees of traumatic brain injuries and/or post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) sustained through deployment. An additional goal is to decrease the stigma associated with seeking  quote mark mental health quote mark  services as well as improve access to qualified mental health providers at the critical point, when a NG or USAR member (or family member) recognizes the need for mental health intervention. <br>  <br> The required services are deemed to be available only from Ceridian Corporation because it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  In addition, as is more fully discussed below, the purpose of this addition is to maintain continuity by obtaining the critical services described at paragraph 3 from the incumbent provider for the minimum period of time necessary to resolve a pending protest and to complete an ongoing competition for a new contract. <br>  <br> The request for proposals (RFP) for this requirement was released in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 (FY12) with contract award in the fourth quarter FY12.  However, the award of the contract has been withheld due to a protest filed 20 September 2012.  As a result, NGB is in the process of responding to and resolving the protest, B-407377. <br>  <br> Failure to provide these services for the NGB and USAR on a continuous and unbroken basis would significantly harm the DoD as these services are critical to the health and welfare of members of the National Guard and USAR.  The National Guard depends on the full time, licensed psychological health providers to support the behavioral health needs of Guard members; both soldiers and airmen. There are a number of unique challenges in meeting the psychological needs of its Service members: <br>  <br>  	Armories and Wings are community based <br>  	Locations are seldom within a catchment area of a military treatment facility <br>  	Non-provision of health care treatment <br>  	Varying degrees of capability between communities <br> These licensed psychological health providers provide individual clinical assessment and referral services, intervention regarding critical incident response, assistance with transition and civilian reintegration, education and information training on a variety of behavioral health topics and these providers offer expert consultation to leaders on mitigation strategies. <br>  <br> This program's priority has been and will remain the safety and stability of the Force; particularly for operational readiness. Local provider networks as well as community resource partners have been established.  <br>  <br> Utilization data clearly demonstrates a need for such a program. Within the last 10 months, 1796 Service members have sought this professional assistance. Of those 1796 clinical Service member assessments, 645 were assessed to be  quote mark high risk quote mark ; victim risk, suicide risk, homicide risk, duty to warn cases or assault risk. These licensed clinicians have provided 11,463 consultations (of which 1008 were for high risk situations), 8250 screenings and conducted 2217 briefings. <br> The Army National Guard has had 69 Guard member suicides to date this calendar year, the Air National Guard has had 17 suicides to date. <br>  <br> Theses licensed psychological health clinicians are critical to the safety and stability of our Force. The National Guard cannot afford to have a gap in psychological health services for Service members in our 54 States, Territories and the District of Columbia, nor in our 89 Air National Guard Wings. <br> The military is currently experiencing an unprecedented number of mental health challenges of the Force and the National Guard is no exception. It is imperative that the National Guard maintain these licensed providers, who continue to intervene in support of our soldiers, airmen and families. <br>  <br> No other contractor could fulfill the services required in the short timeframe available without a significant break in the continuity of services critical to service member psychological health.  In order to ensure that services are uninterrupted, these services must be obtained from the current company currently providing these services as a primary subcontractor, Ceridian Corporation.  Although the incumbent prime contractor is currently performing acceptably with regard to the delivery of services, these services are provided almost entirely by a sub-contractor, Ceridian, as a pass through.  The relationship between the incumbent and service provider is deemed to be unsustainable due to ongoing failure on the part of the prime to remain current on payments, which has nearly resulted in the termination of the relationship between the parties on multiple recent occasions.  Because the critical personnel on this contract are employees of Ceridian, the Government lacks confidence that the prime contractor could fill the positions held by Ceridian employees in a timely manner. No other vendor would be able to begin performance by 22 Septemeber2012 without substantial disruption in ongoing critical services.  Typically, vendors require approximately 30 days to transition from the incumbent new provider. During this transition period, the following important and time consuming activities typically take place: issuance of various task orders, hiring of highly specialized staff, transfer of ongoing cases.  Given the limited time available, the Government has no confidence that these tasks could be accomplished within a shorter timeframe, and the performance risk under such a scenario is unacceptable given the nature of these services. <br>  <br> Even assuming another vendor can accomplish a transition in less than 30 days, insufficient time remains to allow for the award of a new contract competitively or otherwise, to another vendor, and to effect transition, as described above.  Furthermore, even if a vendor other than the current service provider could begin performance, assuming the resolution of the pending protest, completion of the pending competition and transition period would take approximately one to three months; the vendor would perform for a short and indefinite period with the expectation that performance would then begin under a new competitive contract.  Such multiple transitions conducted over a short time span pose an unacceptably high risk of disruption to the provision of critical support services to service members, with a potential negative impact on ongoing critical cases.  Due to the difficulty of transitioning between contractors, frequent disruptions occur despite the best efforts of the Government and the contractors to ensure a smooth transition and it is critical that these disruptions be minimized. <br>  <br> In sum, it is in the Government's vital interest to issue a contract to the current service provider to ensure the critical services are provided.  This will maintain the status quo by extending the performance of this company until the protest is resolved and the new contract awarded.  Furthermore, this course of action meets both the minimum requirements of the Government and reflects sound business judgment.

<DESC>Under this Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), the contractor, Benchmark International, Inc. (BMI), independently provides support services to satisfy the overall operational objectives of National Guard Bureau (NGB)-J8 and National Guard Offices located at Combatant Commands (COCOMs) where their Area of Responsibility (AOR) includes one or more of the 54 states and territories with National Guard forces.  It also includes COCOMs that are functional commands where the National Guard Bureau Joint Staff has a need to establish a J8 liaison function, such as USJFCOM.  The primary objective is to provide contractor services and deliverables through consultation services to NGB-J8, or the applicable COCOM National Guard Office, concerning National Guard (NG) joint capabilities development for Homeland Defense (HD) and Civil Support (CS), Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Joint Capability Integration and Development System (JCIDS) process, Planning, Programming, Budget and Execution (PPBE), NGB Corporate Process, NGB Joint Program Management, Department of Defense (DoD) strategic planning processes, and NG Joint Experimentation.  The contractor provides coordination and analysis requirements to support the integration of NGB issues and capabilities in COCOM resource planning, advocacy and operational execution.  Detailed knowledge/experience working with current NG joint capabilities to include Joint Force Headquarters-State (JFHQ-State), the Critical Infrastructure Program - Mission Assurance Assessment (CIP-MAA) Program, the Joint Integrated Training Capability (JITC), and the Chemical, Biological, Radiological/Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) Enhanced Response Force Package (CERFP) is required.   <br>  <br> The contractor provides capabilities based analysis to identify NG joint capability needs in terms of doctrine, operations, training, materiel, leadership, personnel and facilities (DOTMLPF), and coordinate the flow of requirements through the NG Corporate Process,  provide support for NGB Joint Programs throughout the JCIDS process or any other process used to obtain NG joint capabilities, cost and analyze current initiatives and aid in advocating for resources within the PPBE process, interpret and make recommendations to influence the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG), Joint Planning Guidance (JPG), IPLs, and the Program Objective Memorandums (POMs) of the DoD, Services and COCOMs, support Joint Program Management to achieve Structured Force Development, and plan, coordinate and execute National Guard engagement in Joint Experimentation. <br>  <br> For the National Guard Office at a COCOM, the contractor provides services for Strategy and Policy Analysis, Plans and Program Support, and Administrative Support, and any other support function as outlined in individual task orders issued under this BPA.  Contractor personnel complete a wide-range of tasks to include independent research and analysis, joint staff coordination, and must possess effective writing and communication skills.  <br>  <br> The required services are deemed to be available only from Benchmark International, Inc. because it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  In addition, as is more fully discussed below, the purpose of this addition is to maintain continuity by obtaining the critical services described at paragraph 2 from the incumbent provider for the minimum period of time necessary to conduct a new contract competition. <br>  <br> It was anticipated that the release of the request for proposals (RFP) for this requirement, would take place in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 (FY12) with contract award in the first quarter FY13.  However, the release of the RFP and award of the contract had to be delayed due to the evolution of the requirement stemming from the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2012; specifically, the inclusion of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (CNGB) on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the additional strategic analysis requirements for the NGB Joint Staff that accompany this increased level of responsibility on the part of the CNGB.  As a result, NGB is in the process of finalizing these unanticipated changes to the requirement. <br>  <br> Failure to provide these services for the NGB on a continuous and unbroken basis would significantly harm the DoD as these services are critical to the mission of the National Guard Bureau.  The lack of strategic analysis services would severely limit the ability of NGB to conduct time sensitive analysis related to the JCIDS and PPBE processes and, in particular, preparation of NGB input into the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), which will set a long-term course for DoD as it assesses the threats and challenges that the nation faces and re-balances DoD's strategies, capabilities, and forces to address today's conflicts and tomorrow's threats.  BMI's ongoing support to the Support to Strategic Analysis (SSA) process and its joint analytic products such as Defense Planning Scenarios (DPS), Multi Service Force Deployment (MSFD) documents, Analytic Baseline (AB) studies, and Operational Availability (OA) studies is vital to the joint planning community and used to determine future force structure of the National Guard. <br>  <br> No other contractor could fulfill the services required in the short timeframe available without a significant break in the continuity of services critical to national security.  In order to ensure that services are uninterrupted, these services must be obtained from the incumbent, BMI.  The incumbent is currently performing acceptably and no other vendor would be able to begin performance by 1 October 2012, without substantial disruption in ongoing critical projects.  Typically, vendors require approximately 30 to 60 days to transition from the incumbent new provider. During this transition period, the following important and time consuming activities typically take place: issuance of various task orders, hiring of highly specialized staff, transfer of ongoing tasks.  Given the limited time available, the Government has no confidence that these tasks could be accomplished within a shorter timeframe, and the performance risk under such a scenario is unacceptable given the nature of these services. <br>  <br> Even assuming another vendor can accomplish a transition in less than 30 days, insufficient time remains to allow for the award of a new contract competitively or otherwise, to another vendor, and to effect transition, as described above.  Furthermore, even if a vendor other than the incumbent could begin performance, assuming a competition and transition period would take three months, the vendor would only perform for three months with the expectation that performance would then begin under a new competitive contract.  Such multiple transitions conducted over a short time span pose an unacceptably high risk of disruption to the provision of critical support services to the NGB Joint Staff, which would negatively impact PPBE, JCIDS and QDR efforts as well as other ongoing time sensitive efforts.  NGN has overseen numerous service transitions in the recent past.  Due to the difficulty of transitioning between contractors, frequent disruptions occur despite the best efforts of the Government and the contractors to ensure a smooth transition. <br>  <br> In sum, it is in the Government's vital interest to extend the current contract to the incumbent provider to ensure the critical services are provided.  This will maintain the status quo by extending the contractual relationship with the incumbent until the current contract is re-competed.  Furthermore, it meets both the minimum requirements of the Government and reflects sound business judgment.
