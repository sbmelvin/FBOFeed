<CONTACT>Patricia D. Kniffin, Contracting Officer, Phone 215-737-5097, Email patricia.kniffin@dla.mil - Jayne A Bailie, Contract Specialist, Phone 215-737-6080, Email Jayne.Bailie@dla.mil
<DESC>&nbsp;The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Supply Chain is hereby soliciting offers to select Pharmaceutical Prime Vendor (PPV) distributors to provide pharmaceutical products for the PPV Re-Solicitation (PPV-RS). PPV-RS refers to the Program name. The Regions are: North/Europe, South/Southcom, West/Pacific, Designated Providers (DPs)/Other Government Agencies (OGAs), Upper Prairie (Small Business Set-Aside), and a Back-Up Supplier (BS). The PPV will need to provide next day deliveries (Mon-Fri) to the PPV customers. The PPV is also required to supply War Readiness Material (WRM) requirements as cited in the Statement of Work (SOW).<br /><br />The awarded contractor will be responsible to furnish pharmaceutical products in accordance with the specified ordering, packaging, shipping, receiving, and unique requirements as stated in the solicitation. This acquisition will cover medical pharmaceuticals in the 6505 stock catalog/schedule and the current National Drug Code (NDC) database. One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to Free Trade Agreements.<br /><br />The PPV contract will have a base period of thirty months and three thirty month option periods for a potential ten (10) year contract. The estimated contract value including all options is $26.1B. Under this solicitation, the awarded contractor will be responsible to furnish pharmaceutical program items ordered by the Ordering Facility(s).<br /><br />This acquisition will result in a Firm Fixed-Price Requirements Contract(s). Competition will be sought, promoted, and sustained through the issuance of a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) on a full and open competition basis (except for the Upper Prairie Region, which is reserved as a Small Business Set-Aside).<br /><br />The Government intends to make multiple Primary Supplier awards for this procurement. The intent is to have at least two different contractors awarded under the unrestricted portion of this solicitation. This course of action will ensure that no one Primary Supplier receives an award for all of the Military Services' pharmaceutical requirements. This diversification increases the Department of Defense's access to vital pharmaceuticals during times of contingency or natural disasters. Global regions have similar but different dollar values. The offerors may propose offers combining Regions i.e. Region 0001 and 0002, Regions 0001 and 0003, Regions 0002 and 0003, and can add line 0004 (DPs/OGAs) to any of the aforementioned combinations. The Government cannot predetermine the order that lines will be awarded. The Government will make awards based on the evaluation criteria cited in the solicitation. However, the Government reserves the right to make awards of multiple lines to the same contractor, if the Government deems that it is in the Government's best interest. In order to ensure that multiple sources are available and to ensure the continuous availability of reliable sources of supplies, the Government reserves the right to exclude, under the authority of FAR 6.202, an awardee under this solicitation from being eligible for multiple lines under this solicitation. <br /><br />This is a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Acquisition. DLA Troop Support will make an award to the responsive and responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically acceptable and provides the lowest overall price to the Government considering the base and all option periods. Lowest Price is based on best overall distribution fee computation. In addition to the LPTA, it is the intention of the Government to use the Reverse Auction strategy to obtain the best distribution fee possible. The offeror is required to submit its distribution fees for each line item as stated above. The Reverse Auction process may be used to determine the final distribution fees for purposes of evaluation for award.<br /><br />Copies of the solicitation will be available on or about Sep. 04, 2013. <br /><br />To obtain a copy of the solicitation, please visit the Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Once the solicitation is available on FEDBIZOPPS it will remain open for 45 days. All responsible sources that submit a proposal will be considered by the Agency.<br />

<DESC>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a Full and Open Competitive solicitation for the development and production of the TI 16 CDS. This requirement also includes spares, repair parts and Engineering Services.  The resultant contract will include two years of development, including First Article Units and performance of Environmental Qualifications.  The contract will also include one year of full-rate production, along with two (2) one year production options.

A single IDIQ contract will be awarded to the offeror that represents the best value to the Government.  The award is anticipated in the 1st quarter of FY 2015.

The final RFP is expected to be issued by December 2013.
  NAVSEA will not be conducting an Industry Day session prior to the release of the final Request for Proposal (RFP); therefore, NAVSEA is requesting that industry provide feedback on the ability to meet the key requirements and schedules as defined in this Request for Information (RFI).  

A Competition Library containing Government Furnished Information (GFI) has been established by PEO IWS 1.0.  CD-ROMs are available to eligible parties to review prior to the issuance of a solicitation.  Requests for a copy of the Competition Library shall be sent via e-mail to Ms. Cristin Clague, AEGIS Baseline Contracts Program Analyst, 202-781-5410, cristin.clague@navy.mil with a copy to Ms. Kathryn Triplin, Contract Specialist, kathryn.triplin@navy.mil.
 

The Government will accept questions requesting clarification of the documents contained in the Competition Library and attached to this posting.  Interested parties are requested to provide responses and submit questions or comments NLT 9 August 2013.  Additionally, interested parties are requested to consider the following items and provide responses via email to the Contract Specialists:

1.	Schedule  The schedule is driven by the need to have fully environmentally qualified 1st production units by August 2016.  The Government is requesting feedback on the ability of industry to meet this key date given the constraints contained in the draft Statement of Work. 
2.	Technical Feasibility  The key requirements in the System Requirements Documents and Critical Item Development Specifications are the use of innovative touch panel technology, the need for reliable systems to reduce maintenance, and the usability requirements driven by the US Navy Sailors.
  The Government is requesting industry feedback on the ability to meet all of these requirements in a single solution. 

Only questions transmitted electronically to NAVSEA Contracts shall receive a response.  Responses will be posted to this solicitation notice on FedBizOpps.  The Points of Contact (POC) for this RFI are Mr. Matthew Harbeson, Contract Specialist, 202-781-4256, matthew.harbeson@navy.mil and Ms. Kathryn Triplin, Contract Specialist, kathryn.triplin@navy.mil.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Weapon System Support plans to award a five year Repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) which will support the repair of 38 line item components, which are being uploaded with this synopsis as an Attachment A, for aircrafts: F-18, H-1, P-3, H-53, E-2, V-22.  Items will be repaired by Parker Hannifin (59211) located in Irvine, CA.  The repair work is performed by Parkers own facilities located in various cities to include performance taking place in: Irvine, CA; Kalamazoo, MI; Elyria, OH; Dublin, GA; and Hauppauge, NY.  Parker is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of these items and is the only known source to possess full repair capability.  Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government.
 Therefore, the items listed on Attachment A, are sole source to Parker.  Even though these items are sole source to Parker, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  For any questions concerning this notice, contact the Contract Specialist Diana Weiss at (215) 697-5231.

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps or by calling the NAVSUP WSS PCO.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Specialty engineering consultants may be required.  Requirements will vary for each task order and will be defined in the task order scope of work.  Work may be in preparation for design-build or design-bid-build projects.  The complete scope of work that will be in the resulting IDIQ contracts is attached to this announcement.

In accordance with FAR 36.602-1, application packages will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Key personnel are defined as the lead architect or discipline engineer, project manager and quality control manager assigned to this contract.

Specific projects should include remodeling, renovation and new construction at operating medical facilities.  At least one project should be for the renovation of electrical and mechanical systems in an occupied facility.

3.	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Describe the firm's ability to utilize an adequate number of personnel and the proposed team's ability to complete several small task orders concurrently.  Task orders may be for a wide range of projects and may require a quick turn-around.  Information provided shall include the workload availability of the firm and sub-consultants as well as any specialized equipment that may be available.

4.	Past performance on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.  In addition to information submitted, the government will consider information obtained from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and any other sources deemed necessary by the government.

5.	Location in the general geographical area of the facilities covered in this announcement as well as knowledge of the locality of the project provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms.  Award of contracts will be weighted based on proximity to the facilities.

1.	Reputation and standing of the firm and its principle officials with respect professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.  This criterion will be applied to proposed sub-consultants.

2.	Record of significant claims against the client because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.

3.	Specific experience and qualifications of personnel and sub-consultants proposed for assignment to this contract and their record of working together as a team.

To assist the government in selecting the most highly qualified contractor, those firms slated as highly qualified may be interviewed or asked to submit supplemental responses.

1.	Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses;

2.	Veteran-Owned Small Businesses;

3.	All other small businesses

Firms that are other than a small business as determined by the applicable size standard will not be eligible for award.

Negotiations will be conducted with the mostly highly qualified firms to establish hourly rates for each discipline.  The negotiated rates will be incorporated into the subsequent IDIQ contract.

For each task order, the VA will issue a request for proposal which will include a project-specific scope of work.  The A/E will provide a proposal based on the pre-negotiated hourly rates and the level of effort necessary for each required discipline to perform the project scope of work.

Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing, via email, to Charlene Duncan, Contracting Officer, at charlene.duncan@va.gov.

<DESC>The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is the Federal Law Enforcement and Security Organization responsible for the Protection and Security of Federal Buildings, Property, and Personnel across the Nation. The FPS operations focus on Law Enforcement and reduction of Federal Facility vulnerabilities to criminal and terrorist threats as well as accidental and natural hazards, while ensuring that Public Facilities are safe, secure, and remain available as a vital part of everyday American life. FPS currently performs all necessary Security and Law Enforcement functions at nearly 9,000 federally owned and leased locations throughout the United States and its territories. <br /><br />The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is conducting Market Research to locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential Small Business Sources capable of providing Protective Security Officers (PSO) Services at FBI Facilities in Buffalo and Albany, New York. A PSO is the equivalent of an Armed Guard II as set forth in the Department of Labor (DOL) Directory of Occupations. The information requested by this Sources Sought may be used within FPS to facilitate Acquisition Planning and will not be disclosed outside of the Government.<br /><br />The Contractor will be required to provide and maintain all management, supervision, manpower, training, equipment, supplies, licenses, permits, certificates, insurance, pre-employment screenings, reports, files and any other resources necessary to accomplish the security services. PSOs will be required to be armed and some posts may require screening of visitors using x-rays/magnetometers. All personnel supporting the Contract will be required to meet FPS training, certification, suitability standards and the security services to be provided will include:<br /><br /><strong>Basic Services</strong> - Basic Services are the permanent ongoing recurring services at Federal Locations.<br /><br /><strong>Temporary Additional Services (TAS)</strong>&nbsp;- During the term of the Contract, the Government will have requirements for Temporary Additional Services (TAS) beyond the Basic Services requirements. TAS are short term, non-recurring needs for service such as an increase in hours to an existing post or added posts to include the weekend where a public demonstration is taking place over the weekend, addition of posts to provide for increased security for special events or high profile visitor to the building, extension of existing post hours in a building to cover seasonal fluctuations (such as at an IRS building during tax season), etc. Due to the nature of TAS the Contractor may be required to perform these services with little advance notice.<br /><br /><strong>Emergency Security Services (ESS)</strong>&nbsp;- The Contractor shall furnish fully qualified PSOs, management, supervision, equipment, supplies and any other cost for sustained emergency surge security force services. Deployments may be to large and small-scale events such as natural disasters, civil disturbances, or other unanticipated events on an as-needed basis. The requirements under "ESS" Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) may be ordered for anywhere in the geographic area covered under this Contract with little, if any advance notice. There will be no "phase-in" period for these requirements. The Contractor shall have sufficient, fully qualified staff to meet all requirements ordered under the ESS CLIN at any time.<br /><br />The training requirements to be provided by the Contractor for all PSOs working under this effort can be broken down into four categories:<br /><br /><strong>One Time Only:<br /></strong>40 hour Basic Training<br />Initial Weapons Training<br />Orientation Training<br />Supervisor Training<br /><br /><strong>Annual:<br /></strong>AED<br />CPR<br />Less-Than-Lethal Weapons (i.e. Baton/OC Spray)<br /><br /><strong>Semi-Annual:</strong> <br />Weapons<br /><br /><strong>Every Three Years:<br /></strong>First-Aid<br />Refresher Training<br /><br />This acquisition is for approximately 135,000 hours of Basic Services, 600 hours of Temporary Additional Services and 600 hours of Emergency Security Services per year. Currently, there are an estimated 12&nbsp;PSOs protecting approximately 4 posts at 2 buildings. The estimated value of this Contract is between $5M and $6M.<br /><br />For purposes of the Sources Sought, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561612 and the small business size standard is $18.5 million.<br /><br />If you believe your firm is capable of providing the requirements described in this Sources Sought, please provide capability information using the attached Sources Sought Questionnaire in excel format via email to Margie Cox Marvel, margaretmary.coxmarvel@hq.dhs.gov by October 24, 2013 at 1400 EST. In the subject line of your e-mail response, please provide your Firms Name and the Solicitation Number (HSHQE2-14-R-00002). <br /><br /><strong>The Government requests that you do NOT submit any other company promotional or informational material.<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is issued for informational and planning purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, or an Invitation for Bid. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a Solicitation or ultimately award a Contract for the items contained in the Sources Sought. In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this Sources Sought, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. THEREFORE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION. <br /><br /></span></strong>All responses will be used to determine the appropriate Acquisition Strategy for the future Acquisition.<br /><br />Per HSAM 3005.207 the FedBizOpps staff is not authorized to determine the classification code for any FedBizOpps notice. Because a misclassified Contract action fails to notify the firms most likely to respond and therefore may violate the Competition in Contracting Act, the Contracting Officer is held responsible for correctly classifying a FedBizOpps notice. A misclassified Contract action must be corrected and re-synopsized in the FedBizOpps. Detailed classification codes are available on the FedBizOpps website at: http://www.FedBizOpps.gov/. <br />

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOTICE RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) PART 10: MARKET RESEARCH. This RFI is issued solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the United States (U.S.) Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Please be advised that all material submissions and responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.
<p>SCOPE:</p>
<p>The USCG is conducting market research of a Small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) that will deploy from the USCG's National Security Cutter (NSC).</p>
<p>By providing the NSC with a persistent surveillance capability that can remain airborne for twelve hours per day, sUAS is envisioned as extending the "eyes and ears" of the NSC. The sUAS will be used to support surveillance, detection, classification, identification, and prosecution for all of the NSC's missions in all of the NSC's maritime operating areas.</p>
<p>Using fully autonomous flight controls, the sUAS should be capable of being operated by one person, including simultaneous use of all payloads (e.g., electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) and other sensors), which will provide real-time information to the NSC.</p>
<p>The sUAS should have minimal impact on the ship's crew or operations. The aircraft should be able to be launched, recovered, and stowed in a short time period, with significantly fewer personnel than typically required for cutter-based manned helicopters. Likewise, to minimize impact to potential manned flight operations, the aircraft should be capable of launch and recovery, and the flight deck cleared, while a USCG helicopter is already spotted and tied down on the flight deck with unfolded rotor blades.</p>
<p>The USCG is particularly interested in systems that have commonality with existing Department of Homeland Security or Department of Defense programs, and are technologically and production mature.</p>
<p>Please provide your capability to satisfy the USCG's requirements, as well as the information immediately below, no later than 3:59 PM EST, Nov 15th, 2013 to Jerry.Low@uscg.mil as a Windows Vista/Microsoft Compatible zip file if over 1MB in size. Questions of a technical nature should be directed in writing to Stephen Kellogg, Program Manager, at Stephen.a.kellogg@uscg.mil. Please provide the following:</p>
<p>1. Prospective Offeror Identification:<br />a. Company name/commercial and government entity (CAGE code if applies)<br />b. Address<br />c. Phone Number<br />d. Fax Number (if applicable)<br />e. Email address<br />f. Point of Contact information</p>
<p>2. Your response should demonstrate a firm understanding of the requirements, addressing the following:<br />a. Provide a brief description of your business, including capability and resources necessary to provide a product to the government or commercial market that meets the stated requirements.<br />b. Describe the degree of commonality your system has with existing DHS or DOD programs.<br />c. Describe the degree to which your system is production-ready and mature. What is your established technological readiness level (TRL) and stage of production, if applicable?</p>
<p>Additionally, please address the following system-specific questions:</p>
<p>3. Please provide a description of your system, including:<br />a. Approximate dimensions and weights of aircraft, launch and recovery equipment, cutter-based antennas, control stations, and other essential items or assemblies.<br />b. Whether all aircraft, launch and recovery equipment, spares, and maintenance and support equipment, will fit within the dimensions of a single NSC hangar (approximately 53 feet long, by 18 feet wide, by 16 feet high), while allowing sufficient room for maintenance within the hangar while the NSC is underway.</p>
<p>4. Will your system be capable of complying with Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) issued flight clearances, aviation facilities certifications, and/or military UAS airworthiness certifications that will be necessary for it to operate from the NSC?</p>
<p>5. Is your system capable of meeting TEMPEST requirements (see glossary)?</p>
<p>6. Is your ground control station (GCS) capable of:<br />a. Transferring or exporting flight parameter and payload data from the GCS to the NSC's command and control systems? If so, how would this accomplished?<br />b. Being upgraded when necessary for integration of future capabilities?</p>
<p>7. Is your system capable of:<br />a. Automatic EO/IR target detection to assist the pilot's ability to detect surface targets?<br />b. Surface search radar?<br />c. Radio direction finding (covering at least 406 Mhz EPIRB and marine band VHF-FM frequencies)?<br />d. Airborne Sense and Avoid?</p>
<p>8. Please briefly address the following human systems integration/human factors:<br />a. What types of training systems (e.g., instructors, curriculum, manuals, desktop trainers, interactive courseware, maintenance mock-ups) are available to support your system?<br />b. Were published military and civil human performance and safety standards applied during development of your system?<br />c. Can your system be operated and maintained by personnel ranging anthropometrically from the 5th percentile of females to the 95% percentile of males, as defined in DoD Handbook 743, Anthropometry of U.S. Military Personnel?</p>

<p><br />GLOSSARY</p>
<p>Autonomous [Flight]: The sUAS pilot does not directly control the UA's engine or flight control surfaces. The UA's engine and flight control surfaces are controlled by on-board computers via the direction of pre-programmed operations (e.g., flight plan route / altitude / speed) or the pilot's GCS inputs to navigation parameters (e.g., fly heading X or track Y, climb to altitude of Z feet, orbit position, perform recovery, etc.). Autonomous launch may be manually actuated by the sUAS aircrew, but the UA's engine and flight controls will be manipulated by the on-board computers..</p>
<p>Real Time: Pertaining to the delay introduced by automated data processing between the occurrence of an event and the use of the processed data. As applied within this document, the term real time depicts an event or situation as it existed at the current time less the processing time where this delay is not perceived by the operator - e.g., for sensor display, cursor control, etc.</p>
<p>TEMPEST: Tempest (often spelled TEMPEST) is an unclassified term or codename referring to investigations and studies of compromising emanations (CE) from electrically operated information processing equipment. Compromising emanations are defined as unintentional intelligence-bearing signals which, if intercepted and analyzed, may disclose the information transmitted, received, handled, or otherwise processed by any information-processing equipment.</p>

<DESC>Per FAR part 8.405-6 notice for order shall be posted to FedBizOpps within 14 days of award. Due to the Government shutdown the post was not able to be submitted on time. Award was made on 9/24/2013.<br />Contracting Office ZIP Code: 30341<br />Contract Award and Solicitation Number: 200-2010-F-35288 - MOD 13 and 14; 2010-Q-11924<br />Contract Award Dollar Amount: $1,998,069.00 (Option 3, Year 4)<br />Contract Line Item Numbers: 0039, 0040, 0041 (Optional Line Items: 0042 and 0043)<br />Contract Award Date: 09/24/2013 (Option 3, Year 4)<br />Contractor: SRA International Inc. <br />Place of Contract Performance: Contractor's site
<p><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to provide contractor support for processing the data collection forms from components of the National Health Care Surveys and related data collection efforts according to specifications provided within the SOW. This is to modify services and exercise these additonal services under Option 3, Year 4.</p>
<p>SRA is the incumbent contractor currently providing services for these Tasks, all of which are related to the National Health Care Surveys. The key surveys involved, NAMCS and NHAMCS, are very complex, including a combination of traditional survey data and abstracted medical data, which requires ICD coding. Some particulars related to these surveys have changed dramatically since the initial year of this contract. Originally, the surveys were conducted on paper and pencil, and the contract requirement included extensive data entry and validation, receipt and control, and considerable medical coding. In year two of the contract, the surveys moved to a computerized data collection platform, and the sample quintupled in size. This meant that many of the data management tasks changed completely, with a reduced emphasis on keying but a much greater need for ICD coding. At the same time, several supplements were launched to collect data from the same populations, and with partially overlapping but expanded content. Although the requirements changed, all tasks covered the same survey systems, and performance of the work still required the same highly specific knowledge of content, objectives, data collection procedures, processing requirements, data verification protocols, and coding systems. The knowledge base would be lost if the task had to be started with new support. It would not be possible to process a new contract without incurring extensive additional costs and delays in the production and release of mission-critical data and the urgency of the timeline would not be met. Data from these surveys are used to monitor the effect of major developments in the U.S. health care system. The revised contract tasks were essentially designed to produce faster data that monitors much more specific geographic areas than was previously possible. The work as described in the original contract would not have met the data needs of NCHS and its external partners-rapid changes and the need for more precise data required considerable system reengineering. However, the overall nature of the data, coding requirements, and final dataset specifications remained the same, and the current contractor had very specific experience with these systems and specifications. It was necessary to retain this experience in order to meet the expanding data needs of this contract and urgent timelines.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services. This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.

<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income. Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies. The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-01-462-1383 <br />ETS Stock Numbers: AVE 68051</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-01-462-1385 <br />ETS Stock Numbers: AVE 68059</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-01-462-1386 <br />ETS Stock Numbers: AVE 68056</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement. That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program. If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm. If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance. At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible. Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1. Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data. Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2. Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period. If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3. Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on. Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4. If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5. Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6. The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7. Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8. Provide your firm's DUNS number. The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9. Include your firm's mailing address. Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box. The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response. Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than October 31, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.

<SUBJECT>Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Opportunity for Evaluating Influenza Vaccines and Therapeutics in an Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model
<SOLNBR>NIAID-TTIPO-2012-002
<RESPDATE>101714
<CONTACT>Maryann T. Puglielli, Ph.D., J.D., Technology Development Specialist, Phone 3014516863, Email maryann.puglielli@nih.gov
<DESC>SUMMARY: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is announcing an opportunity for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for evaluating influenza vaccines and therapeutics in an Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model developed at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The NIAID seeks to enter into a CRADA with one or more biotechnology or biomedical companies to use the Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model developed by NIAID for the purposes of developing new influenza drug treatments or vaccines.<br />&nbsp;
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The high seasonal morbidity and mortality associated with both pandemic and seasonal influenza, the continued threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza infections, the development and global spread of antiviral resistance, and the need to plan for future influenza pandemics makes influenza a high priority in infectious disease research. Indeed, approximately 30,000 people die each year from complications due to influenza infection in the U.S. alone. Because animal models of influenza are limited in their ability to replicate human disease, new drug development and the search for better vaccines and vaccine strategies will require significant clinical development. Moreover, many important questions about influenza infection can only be approached through human studies of influenza. In an effort to facilitate these clinical studies, NIAID has developed the Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model using challenge viruses which are reverse genetics produced and cell cultured wild-type influenza A viruses for use in healthy volunteers under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Currently NIAID has an A(H1N1)pdm09 Influenza virus available under an IND and plans to use its method of reverse genetics and cell culture to produce additional influenza strain preparations, including strain A/H3N2, for use in human studies.</p>
<p>The Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model stands to streamline and reduce the cost of evaluating candidate vaccines and treatments. Specifically, clinical studies of influenza are expensive and inefficient due to the large numbers of subjects needed to determine the efficacy of a new treatment or vaccine, and they are limited in their ability to provide standardized data due to an inability (1) to identify the timing of viral exposure and development of disease and (2) to assess pre-exposure immunity. These factors limit the success of such studies and an investigator's ability to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine or therapeutic as well as to study the natural history and pathogenesis of this global disease. In a well-characterized challenge model such as this, the number of volunteers needed for subsequent efficacy studies will be smaller and the resulting data more informative.</p>
<p>Many important research questions about influenza infection and the resulting immune response can be approached through studies evaluating the impact of influenza vaccines and therapeutics on these aspects of influenza virology. For example, use of an influenza vaccine in NIAID's Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model could further the understanding of what components of the anti-influenza immune response are important for protection against influenza infection. Use of a therapeutic in NIAID's Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model could provide insights on viral titer and length of shedding and their relation to symptomatic illness, and the emergence of strains resistant to such therapeutics. Depending on the nature of the vaccine or therapeutic being evaluated, broad scientific questions regarding influenza virology and immunology, not limited to the above examples, could be explored.</p>
<p>With regard to improving the understanding of influenza infection and the resulting immune response in humans, previous human challenge studies have been used to address some aspects of influenza related illness by evaluating the timing of viral replication, shedding, clinical symptoms, and innate and adaptive immune response. They also proved extraordinarily useful in the development of currently available antivirals. Although the influenza research community clearly identifies a need for these types of studies, in the United States all but one published study were performed prior to 1990, and all had limitations due to the scope of the study or the scientific techniques that were available at the time. Prior to the development of NIAID's model, no virus for the purpose of study in healthy volunteers was available in the U.S. and these studies were not being performed.</p>
<p>The first challenge virus, A(H1N1)pdm09, has been evaluated in the NIAID's Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model and an optimal dose and well as methods of performing this type of study have been established. This validated model of infection in these volunteers will allow more efficient and cost-effective phase II clinical evaluation of antivirals and vaccines, as noted above, as well as an opportunity to study correlates of protection and the natural history and pathogenesis of influenza in a controlled setting. In NIAID's model, the timing of exposure will be known, a standard dose identified and used, and many other potentially confounding variables controlled for.</p>
<p>A CRADA is the anticipated collaborative agreement to be entered into with NIAID pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, codified as 15 U.S.C. 3710a, and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended. A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government entities. A CRADA is not a grant, and it is not a contract for the procurement of goods and services. The NIAID is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIAID can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise. The CRADA collaborator can contribute facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funds. The CRADA collaborator will also have an option to negotiate the terms of an exclusive or non-exclusive commercialization license to subject inventions arising under the CRADA. The goals of the CRADA include the rapid publication of research results and timely commercialization of products, diagnostics, and treatments that result from the research.</p>
<p>CRADA partners are currently being sought to evaluate novel therapeutics and vaccines in NIAID's Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model in a clinical setting. The clinical facilities and procedures used in the collaborative research should meet criteria set forth by NIAID in the CRADA agreement. The CRADA partner will be expected to work directly with the NIAID principal investigator to assure consistency with NIAID's Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model. Studies will be designed (1) to meet the specific efficacy testing needs of each individual product under investigation and (2) to further the investigation of influenza related disease. NIAID's clinical principal investigator has extensive experience with running clinical studies of human influenza, working with animal models of influenza, and both classic and molecular virology studies. This principal investigator also has expertise in the area of antiviral resistance and influenza infections in at-risk individuals and populations.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: CRADA partners will be expected to have their own drug or vaccine well characterized, to have Phase I testing complete, and to have their drug or vaccine approved under an FDA IND prior to clinical studies beginning with the NIAID Influenza A Healthy Volunteer Challenge Model. CRADA partners should also have the capacity to recruit volunteers, to provide clinical facilities, and to provide the personnel required to conduct the research, all in coordination with the NIAID principal investigator. In addition, it will be expected that the collaborator would provide funding to supplement the NIAID principal investigator's laboratory budget to support this project.</p>
<p>Prospective CRADA partners are expected to provide a written Capability Statement to the contact person indicated in this announcement prior to consideration by NIAID. The Capability Statement must address, with specificity, each of the following selection criteria: (1) a description of the partner's influenza vaccine or therapeutic and its IND status; (2) results of Phase I testing of the vaccine or therapeutic; (3) ability to perform supporting tests (i.e., immunological testing) relevant to the study; (4) the technical expertise of the partner's principal investigator and laboratory group; (5) the availability and location clinical facilities to carry out the study; and (6) the ability to provide adequate funding to support performance of the research plan throughout the life of the CRADA. NIAID will consider executing a Confidentiality Agreement with a prospective CRADA partner to facilitate receipt of the Capability Statement if requested by a prospective CRADA partner.</p>

<p>Where: William J. Cohen Building located at 330 C Street SW, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Background: DHS S&amp;T is sponsoring a two day technical industry meeting in the area of trace explosive detection capabilities for aviation, facilities, and mass transit security applications. Explosives trace detection is frequently used as a primary or secondary screening method for detection of explosives in screening people, baggage, and cargo. DHS S&amp;T is interested in significantly expanding the number of detectable analytes in explosives trace detection systems to include a range of liquid, volatile and semi-volatile organic, salts and mixtures thereof. The addition of more analytes to the detection requirements for explosives trace detectors will require substantial technology enhancements that provide higher selectivity and sensitivity as well as sample collection improvements.</p>
<p>Purpose: The industry day will outline recent research results and applicability to Explosives Trace Detection (ETD) equipment along with DHS S&amp;T's development strategy related to enhancing explosives detection for trace residues in aviation, facilities, and mass transit security environments to inform an upcoming new program in high resolution explosives trace detection. Project and technology overviews will be provided, in addition to experimental results and project plans for future DHS S&amp;T sponsored research. Technical areas of focus include (1) development of next generation, desktop ETD systems, (2) development of portable ETDs, (3) signature analysis and data analytics for existing sensors and trace detection instrumentation, (4) advanced sampling methodology, both direct and non-contact, and (5) preparation of representative trace explosives sample generation in vapor and particulate form.</p>
<p>Description: This two-day event is anticipated to consist of presentation and poster sessions from DHS S&amp;T, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and various researchers in the technical areas described above. Ample time will be available for interaction with attendees and presenters during presentations, poster sessions, and a networking event. Anticipated Government attendees will include staff from DHS S&amp;T's Explosives Division (EXD) and the TSA.<br />DHS S&amp;T is currently seeking information on the most recent advancements in explosive trace detection. Topics of interest include:</p>
<p>(1) Next generation, desktop ETD systems for air cargo, baggage, or passenger screening that can selectively and sensitively identify analytes from a significantly expanded threat library compared to currently deployed systems and is structured to be modular to enable spiral upgrades as improvements in explosives detection and sampling are realized in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Advanced portable and handheld ETDs that will reduce the required footprint for such machines and allow the use of non-contact (direct analysis) or contact swab sampling while still maintaining a competitive price to comparable ETD systems.</p>
<p>(3) Advanced signature analysis and data analytics for existing sensors and detection instrumentation to define innovative measurement system architectures that jointly optimize the physical measurement system and mathematical processing framework to provide a unified or jointly designed data acquisition, processing, detection, classification and reconstruction architecture or measurement system. Applicable approaches include, but are not limited to signature analysis, data analytics, information theory analysis, compressive measurement, coded apertures, active learning, sensor or data fusion, principle component analysis, adaptive or intelligent measurement approaches, and algorithm development.</p>
<p>(4) Advanced sampling tools and methodology, both direct and non-contact, to increase the collection efficiency and/or provide for additional security flexibility. Applicable areas include, but are not limited to:<br />&bull; improved and/or new swab materials that are cost competitive to current sampling media,<br />&bull; improved wand or swab holder to increase collection efficiency,<br />&bull; novel approaches for sampling from human skin or clothing,<br />&bull; reliable air pulsed sampling and collection techniques,<br />&bull; capability to rapidly sample entire exterior surface of carry-on baggage, checked baggage, or break bulk cargo,<br />&bull; rapid pre-concentration approaches,<br />&bull; complementary combination of direct and non-contact sampling to broaden sampling capability across different explosives families,<br />&bull; an upgradable non-contact trace hand-held sampling tool that will offer increased capability to respond to emerging threats, and<br />&bull; a cost-effective, rugged, ergonomic, "universal" trace collection swabbing tool supporting common ETD systems capable of providing users with feedback with regards to reproducible and adequate pressure application to ensure optimum operation.</p>
<p>(5) Methods for the preparation of reproducible and representative trace explosives samples for testing to include generation in vapor and particulate form to aid in the development of next generation ETD systems.

<p>The DoD Data Research Analysis Priority Area seeks ways to exploit analysis of increasing amounts of information while minimizing the amount of time and personnel required.</p>
<p>For purposes of gauging capabilities in these research areas, only responses from HBCU/MI will be considered.  All respondents other than HBCUs and Tribal Colleges and Universities must include with the description of their research capabilities, a copy of their current (fiscal year 2013) letter of designation from the United States Department of Education certifying eligibility for Title III or Title V assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.)</p>

<a href="mailto:ann.pham@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is contemplating a new multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract for a wide range of training tasks and services to support the Warfighter Outside the Contiguous United States (OCONUS) and Continental United States (CONUS) locations. The proposed program is Train, Educate, and CoacH (TEACH). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 611430 Professional and Management Development Training. The size standard is $10 million average annual receipts. <br>  <br> OCONUS and CONUS units rely on contracted support to train and instruct U.S. military combat troops, foreign national forces (e.g. SW Asia, etc.) and coalition forces in a variety of missions from the very fundamental tenets (literacy instruction) to war fighting skills. These demands and requests to PEO STRI for this instructional training across a varied customer base have driven the PEO to contemplate award of a multiple award contract dedicated to satisfying these customer/Warfighter services. The addition of PEO STRI's new training services contract will give the Army and our other Support Mission Customers a broader performance based service scope and increased efficiencies through competition. <br>  <br> A revised Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is provided with this announcement to industry as a read ahead.  The Government will to provide information, draft documentation, and program updates as soon as they become available and as we finalize our small business strategy. Please continue to monitor FedBizOpps as it is the authoritative source for information related to this program. Thank you. <br>

<p>CDC Policy CDC42.0001</p>
<p>Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) Requirements:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 42.15, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will review and evaluate contract performance. FAR 42.1502 and 42.1503 requires agencies to prepare evaluations of contractor performance and submit them to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The CDC utilizes the Department of Defense (DOD) web-based Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to prepare and report these contractor performance evaluations. All information contained in these assessments may be used by the Government, within the limitations of FAR 42.15, for future source selections in accordance with FAR 15.304 where past performance is an evaluation factor.</p>
<p>The CPARS system requires a contractor representative to be assigned so that the contractor has appropriate input into the performance evaluation process. The CPARS contractor representative will be given access to CPARS and will be given the opportunity to concur or not-concur with performance evaluations before the evaluations are complete. The CPARS contractor representative will also have the opportunity to add comments to performance evaluations.</p>
<p>The assessment is not subject to the Disputes clause of the contract, nor is it subject to appeal beyond the review and comment procedures described in the guides on the CPARS website. Refer to: www.cpars.gov for details and additional information related to CPARS, CPARS user access, how contract performance assessments are conducted, and how Contractors participate. Access and training for all persons responsible for the preparation and review of performance assessments is also available at the CPARS website.</p>
<p>The contractor must provide the CDC contracting office with the name, e-mail address, and phone number of their designated CPARS representative who will be responsible for logging into CPARS and reviewing and commenting on performance evaluations. The contractor must maintain a current representative to serve as the contractor representative in CPARS. It is the contractor's responsibility to notify the CDC contracting office, in writing (letter or email), when their CPARS representative information needs to be changed or updated. Failure to maintain current CPARS contractor representative information will result in the loss of an opportunity to review and comment on performance evaluations.</p>
<p>Provide the current CPARS representative information below.</p>

<p>Ordering Procedures:</p>
<p>(a) All delivery/task orders will be placed against the IDIQs, in writing and signed by a warranted Government Contracting Officer, via facsimile or e-mail. Individual delivery/task orders shall define the task along with delivery or performance time frames and shall establish a firm-fixed price or ceiling price for the task.</p>
<p>(b) Telephone or other verbal orders are not authorized under the IDIQs unless issued by a duly warranted Government Contracting Officer on an emergency basis.</p>
<p>(c) Except for any limitations on quantities in the Order Limitations clause, there is no limit on the number of orders that may be issued. The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations.</p>
<p>(d) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the Contractor within the time specified in the order. The contract shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries that exceeds twelve (12) months following the end of the period of performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>Award of Task Orders:</p>
<p>The Offerors will be requested to submit proposals on a rotational basis by individual task orders. Extenuating circumstances such as familiarity with a site or specialized skills may dictate that a particular offeror be chosen out of order at the discretion of the Contracting Officer (CO).</p>
<p>The fair opportunity process will operate as follows:</p>
<p>a. Task Orders - General:</p>
<p>(1) A written task order, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, shall be the only basis for acquisition of services under the IDIQs.</p>
<p>(2) Orders will be placed directly with the Contractor by CDC Contracting Officers on a rotational basis.</p>
<p>(3) Some orders may be subject to "Fair Opportunity Exceptions" as described below.</p>
<p>(4) The Contractor shall be responsible for performance in accordance with the terms and conditions of the IDIQ when a Task Order is placed by a CDC Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(5) In accordance with FAR 16.505, Task Orders placed under any resultant IDIQ need not be synopsized.</p>
<p>(6) Contractors may not protest the award of the Task Order issued under the resultant IDIQs, except on the grounds that the order increases scope, period, or maximum value of the IDIQ.</p>
<p>Fair Opportunity Exceptions:</p>
<p>The requirement for "fair opportunity" does not apply to orders under $3,000.00 or to orders above $3,000.00 where the Contracting Officer determines that:<br />a. The need for the services is of such urgency that providing such opportunity would result in an unacceptable delay;<br />b. Only one contractor is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services are unique or highly specialized;<br />c. The order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.<br />(End of clause)<br />All orders will be awarded on a Firm-Fixed Price basis using rates proposed similar to those illustrated in the Section marked "Processing of Pharmaceuticals" below, less any discounts made available to the government.</p>
<p>Based on the number and quality of the proposals received, the government anticipates multiple awards, awarding up to six (6) IDIQ contracts, but the exact number of awards may vary.</p>
<p>The Price to the Government for the services provided shall be determined for each order based on the pricing contained within the subsequent IDIQ contract, less any additional discounts that may be proposed on individual orders.</p>
<p>The term of this IDIQ contract shall be five (5) years from the effective date of award. It is estimated that over the five (5) year period the total dollar volume for all of the IDIQ orders under the contract will not exceed $33,000,000.00 in aggregate and no single order should exceed $3 million, unless agreed to by both parties. Individual IDIQ contracts in the awarded suite may have individual estimates that are less than the aggregate estimate of $33 million over 5 years. This amount is estimated at the time of issuance of this IDIQ contract and does not represent the guarantee that any purchases will be made. Neither does this estimate represent a ceiling for the amount of purchases that are made beyond the minimum, and may be exceeded if such action is determined to be in compliance with federal law by the agency ordering official. A Government review of its requirements and the corresponding discounts for this IDIQ contract will be performed annually.</p>

<p>Statement of Objectives (SOO)<br />The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) is the Nation's repository for medical supplies, drugs, vaccines and other related equipment. The SNS exists to re-supply state and local emergency medical responders in disaster events, especially biological or chemical terrorism. The SNS is stored at multiple locations to ensure rapid delivery to areas in need. The purpose of this initiative is to establish IDIQ contract(s) with reverse distributors, hereafter referred to as the Contractor, capable of assisting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), in achieving removal and disposal of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical waste while remaining in compliance with all applicable regulation related to hazardous waste handling. The efficient returns processing method where outdated or no longer required pharmaceuticals and non-pharmaceuticals are disposed of by a reverse distributor will reduce the cost of disposal and assure that the public is fully protected. The contract will include the 48 contiguous United States, the State of Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam. It does not include the states of Alaska or any of the other U.S. territories. The Government's need for on-site and off-site processing function is imperative to assure optimum inventory control.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: The contractor shall dispose of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical waste on a monthly basis and provide all applicable forms and labels needed to ship designated products to the contractor s processing facility. This waste consists of both pharmaceuticals that cannot be returned to the vendor for credit and pharmaceuticals that can be returned to the vendor for credit.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: Contractor shall ensure DSNS achieves maximum credit return, while in conformance with practices and procedures that conform to all existing and applicable laws and regulations of the United States including, but not limited to: the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the U.S. Department of Labor at 29 CFR 1910 et. seq., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at 21 CFR Parts 1 through 1299, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration at 21 CFR Parts 1300 through 1321, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hazardous waste regulations in 40 CFR Parts 260 et. seq., U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) hazardous materials regulations in 49 CFR Parts 100 et. seq. and the laws, ordinances, and regulations of any state, county, parish, township, or municipal subdivision thereof or other governmental agency which may be applicable to the management, handling, storage, removal, and disposal of pharmaceutical waste.</p>
<p>For destruction of all Pharmaceutical, Biologics and non-pharmaceutical, the contractor shall have a representative to verify all lots, descriptions and quantities prior to contractor pick-up.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: The contractor shall have the capacity and capability to increase pharmaceutical, Biologics and non-pharmaceutical waste pickups and disposal during a public emergency situation.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: Waste pickups from the determined pick up location must have a timeline less than 7 days unless informed otherwise by the Government Contracting Officer, COR, or other authorized Government Persons.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: The contractor shall identify recyclable materials and recycle them appropriately. Returns to be processed will cover expired or soon to be expired pharmaceutical items no longer required. Facilities are located throughout the 48 contiguous United States, the State of Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam. It does not include the states of Alaska or any of the other U.S. territories. Returns may include Schedule II - V controlled substance.<br />REQUIRED: A Certificate of Destruction for all pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical waste shall be submitted within thirty (30) days after destructions.</p>
<p>It is estimated that over the five (5) year period the total dollar volume of this IDIQ contract will not exceed $33,000,000.00 in aggregate and no single order should exceed $3 million, unless agreed to by both parties. The Government shall place orders totaling a minimum of $3,000.00 over the life of the IDIQ contract. The maximum amount of all orders issued and awarded over the 5 year period of performance shall not exceed the aggregate or single order amount. The maximum ceiling amount of this IDIQ contract may be increased to accommodate additional needs of the CDC that are within the scope of the IDIQ contract. Additionally, the CDC reserves the right to adjust the maximum values among performance periods and domains if such action is determined to be in compliance with federal law by the agency ordering official.</p>
<p>ITEMS QUALIFYING FOR MANUFACTURER'S RETURN<br />The Contractor shall obtain and complete all manufacturers' return authorization forms. If it is the manufacturer's policy to send these forms directly to the returning facility, the Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the required forms are provided to the return facility in a timely manner. The returning facility in turn will forward the return authorization forms to the Contractor. For all items that qualify for manufacturer's return, the Contractor shall provide the DSNS a report stating the Estimated Return Value (ERV) of those items. The ERV will be used by the customer and the Contractor as an estimate only. The payment of return fees to the Contractor shall be based solely on the Actual Return Value (ARV) obtained from the manufacturer. <br />Note: There may be instances where more favorable return good policies have been negotiated on Federal contracts. In order to take advantage of more favorable return policies, it will be the Government's responsibility to provide a copy of the negotiated agreement(s) to the Contractor.<br />The Contractor is encouraged to establish a working relationship with each returning facility to ensure maximum credit receipt and reduce the cost of returning non-returnable items. The Contractor shall be responsible for contacting the manufacturer to assist in resolving issues of inadequate or non-payment of outstanding credits. Credit may be issued in the form of credit memo (preferred method), exchange one for one, or exchange for other items of equal value. Product replacement or exchange is DSNS's least desired method of reimbursement. Credit memos are to be issued through the returning facilities' respective Prime Vendor and must make reference to the customer account number and/or appropriate invoice number to facilitate the tracking process. If a manufacturer will not provide credit to a facility's PV account, or product exchange, then a check would be accepted. The check should be made payable to the U.S. Treasury. The contractor shall only be required to forward information to the Government that is provided from manufacturers and pharmaceutical return companies.

Shipments to the Contractor that require transport to the disposal location must be done via approved and licensed vehicles in accordance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations where the processing will be completed. Contractor spills or releases of toxic hazardous substances into the environment will be reported to the returning facility immediately.<br />PAYMENTS<br />The payments shall not be made until credits are received and shall be based on the actual credits, not estimated or anticipated credits, thereby increasing the contractor's incentive to obtain maximum credit amounts. The payments to the reverse distributor for both their return and disposal services will be paid by the pharmaceutical Prime Vendor from the manufacturer credits received. The exact payment amount to be tendered shall be addressed in a separate agreement between the Contractor and the Prime Vendor and may include a reasonable administrative fee charged by the Prime Vendor from the MTF credit account.<br />ORDERING<br />The contractors shall setup an 800 number and a web-based ordering system that each customer can access to submit a work order. At a minimum, the system shall include entry fields for Facility Name, Address, City, State, Zip Code, Contact Name, Phone Number, E-mail, DEA Number, Desired Pickup Date, Description of Returns and estimated quantity.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in caseswhere enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense and the United States Public Health Service and with scientists who serve the common good. We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness.<br /><br />This service will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 8.405-6 <em>Limiting Sources</em>.<br /><br /><strong>Sole source determination is made in accordance with</strong>:<br /><br />Orders placed or BPAs established under Federal Supply Schedules are exempt from the requirements in part 6. However, an ordering activity must justify its action when restricting consideration in accordance with paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section-<br /><br />(a) Orders or BPAs exceeding the micro-purchase threshold based on a limited sources justification.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1) Circumstances justifying limiting the source.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) For a proposed order or BPA with an estimated value exceeding the micro-purchase threshold not placed or established in accordance with the procedures in 8.405-1, 8.405-2, or 8.405-3, the only circumstances that may justify the action are-<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized;<br /><br />In FY12, after competing the requirement among small business concerns, USU purchased a replacement lecture capture system from Lunarline, Inc. which was manufactured by Echo 360. The software (Secure Solution, Field Capture and Basic Support for 2,000 users) requires annual renewal, and the hardware (Safe Capture HD Appliance, qty. 9) requires annual maintenance upon lapse of the manufacturer's warranty. Only Lunarline, Inc. as the seller of the Echo 360 system has the ability to provide the necessary annual software renewal and hardware maintenance on the lecture capture system purchased.<br /><br />It is in the Government's best interests to issue an award to Lunarline, Inc. for the annual software license renewal and hardware maintenance for the Echo 360 Lecture Capture System. This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the above-mentioned requirement as specified. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses must be received via email at melissa.marcellus@usuhs.edu by 10:00pm EST on 18 November 2013.

<p>252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

For more information on SAM Registration, please visit http://www.sba.gov/content/register-government-contracting and https://www.sam.gov/sam/transcript/Quick_Guide_for_Contract_Registrations.pdf. Responses are due to the National Park Service-WCP, 7333 W. Jefferson Ave, Suite 155, Lakewood, CO  80235, on or before 3:00 PM Mountain Time, Monday, October 7, 2013.

Background: The National Park Service (NPS) Division of Law Enforcement, Security and Emergency Services has the responsibility of providing security and protection for the visiting public, and the natural, cultural and historical resources located within our National Parks.  Law Enforcement Rangers and Special Agents in this division are involved in operations necessary to provide public safety, control of drug trafficking, and presidentially directed homeland security.  
Objectives: The goal is to make multiple bulk purchases over multiples fiscal years to replace our entire handgun inventory. Purchasing over multiple years will make it easier for a more orderly tracking of the agency-wide issuance of new equipment and return of obsolete equipment. 
Specifically, the NPS has a requirement to replace our entire inventory of Sig Sauer P200 series handguns that have reached or exceeded "end-of-life" criteria based upon the manufacturer's standards and those of the NPS Firearms program. Acquisition of the proposed firearms is to facilitate immediate replacement of like model units in the field in an effort to mitigate potential firearms failure and injury during law enforcement operations or training.

<DESC>MOBILITY AIR FORCES (MAF) DYNAMIC RETASKING CAPABILITY (DRC) HARDWARE CONTRACTOR LOGISTICS DEPOT SUPPORT
<p>1. Introduction<br />DRC is a former Urgent Operational Need (UON), validated by AFCENT in February 2011, fielded in May 2012, and approved by the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) as an Enduring Capability in September 2012. The U.S. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Battle Management Directorate, Theater Battle Control Division at Hanscom AFB, MA, is seeking potential sources of CONUS based Depot level Contractor-Logistics-Support (CLS) for its fielded (CONUS/OCONUS) MAF DRC assets. The DRC Program Office contemplates using CLS for Depot level support of DRC for the foreseeable future. Presently the Air Force has installed and fielded DRC A-Kits on sixty-eight (68) Mobility Air Forces (MAF) aircraft. These A-Kit equipped aircraft are capable of accepting the thirty-six (36) DRC B-kits which were also produced and fielded on the DRC contract. Additionally, there are twelve (12) Field-Test-Equipment (FTE) units assigned to operational units flying DRC equipped aircraft. This hardware (A-Kits, B-Kits, FTEs) is used to sustain DRC operations at seven (7) CONUS and three (3) OCONUS locations.</p>
<p>1.1. A-kits are permanently installed on forty-four (44) C-130J and twenty-four (24) C-17 aircraft. A-Kit installations include cargo bay to cockpit wiring, patch panel, hull mounted antennas, and B-Kit component mounts.</p>
<p>1.2. B-kits are Roll-On, Roll-Off (RORO) assemblies which are easily installed/removed in the cargo bay and cockpit.</p>
<p>1.2.1. Cargo Bay Installation: The 11" x 24" x 68" cargo bay mounted B-Kit communication enclosure contains, power supply, amplifier, Airborne Executive Processor (AEP), SADL radio, ARC-210 radio, fans, filters, wiring, case and latches.</p>
<p>1.2.2. Cockpit Installation: The cockpit mounted B-Kit components are comprised of two (2), easily installed/removed, Portable Mission Display (PMD) monitor/control devices (2" x 6" x 9" screen with bezel mounted controls).</p>
<p>1.3. Software: The DRC B-Kit Airborne Executive Processor (AEP) and Portable Mission Display (PMD) use DRC software version 6.2. DRC version 6.2 incorporates Northrop Grumman developed software for which the Government has both Government Purpose rights and Restricted rights. Restricted, or Northrop Grumman proprietary software titles follow:<br />&bull; Message Broker Services and Operator Station Human-System Interface (HIS) Baseline<br />&bull; Gateway Manager Software Capabilities:<br />o MIDS ETR on MIDS Ethernet<br />o MIDS 1553 virtual terminal and virtual host capabilities<br />o MIDS Platform A terminal emulation mode routing raw FIM/FOM data</p>
<p>1.4. FTEs are land based test units originally produced as developmental tools for the DRC system. Today FTEs are primarily employed as operational test units and have also been employed as DRC system ground stations capable of communicating with DRC aircraft in flight.</p>
<p>1.4.1. The FTE is comprised of a cabinet (3' x 3' x 4'), power distribution device, laptop computer, SADL radio, PRC-117G radio, PSC-5 radio, fans, filters and wiring.</p>
<p>1.5. Air Force maintenance personnel will perform field level preventative and corrective maintenance.

<DESC>TITLE<br />The Advanced Pilot Training (T-X) Branch (WLZA), Training Aircraft Division, Mobility Directorate, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, is issuing a pre-decisional/market research related Request for Information (RFI). This presents an opportunity for industry to provide input to support affordability analyses.<br />FOR PLANNING PURPOSES
<p>This posting is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or a commitment by the Government to award a contract now or in the future. There have been no decisions made by the Government on this acquisition nor is there a commitment to do so. This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only. Submitting a response to this request for information is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated. Responses will be treated as market research information only and will not be evaluated as a proposal. Any question or comment requiring a response will be posted on a subsequent FBO with the Government's response. This RFI will help the United States Government (USG) identify possible agenda topics for future Industry Days and will enable the market research process. Dates for future Industry Days are TBD.<br />REQUIREMENT<br />The Advanced Pilot Training (APT) Family of Systems (FoS) will utilize a full range of ground (e.g., simulators, computer based training, etc.) training systems as well as flight training systems as part of a fully integrated family of systems. If the Government proceeds with the procurement of the APT T-X FoS, it is considering awarding two basic contracts to a single awardee. The first contract would be to complete the EMD phase. This procurement will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, as supplemented. A single award would be used for completion of the Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase, the Production and Deployment phase, and the Operations and Support phases of the program. The EMD contract would be predominately Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF). A portion of the contract will be a combination of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) for Full Rate Production, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) for any studies/analyses and Time &amp; Material (T&amp;M) in order to cover other in-scope modifications. The second contract would be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the remaining phases of the acquisition. The IDIQ would include FPIF delivery orders for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), Firm Fixed Price (FFP) for Full Rate Production (FRP) delivery orders and CPFF, FFP and T&amp;M for Interim Contractor Support (ICS), studies, analysis and "what if" exercises for possible in-scope efforts. <br />GENERAL INFORMATION<br />1. Potential respondents shall understand all laws and regulations required in doing business with the United States Government for an ACAT ID program as defined by Department of Defense Directive (DoD) Instruction 5000.02, "Operation of the Defense Acquisition System" dated December 8, 2008. Noteworthy are compliance with Cost Accounting Standards, Earned Value Management System, Certified Cost and Pricing Data, Item Unique Identification, Airworthiness Certifications, etc. FAR Parts 2, 15 and 16 should be consulted and used.<br />2. The attached matrix is a list of pre-decisional requirements associated with the T-X program. These requirements are currently in draft and will not be finalized until the release of the final request for proposal. As the USG is conducting market research on these potential requirements, we ask you provide input to tell us what issues these present to you as Industry. Your input will aid in affordability analyses and decisions on final requirements.<br />3. Any comments or questions on the above information should be sent to the Training Aircraft Division Contracting Point of Contact,&nbsp;Kevin Christian, at AFLCMC/WLZJC, Bldg 11A, 1970 Monahan Way, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7211 or email william.christian6@us.af.mil no later than 30 calendar days from this posting. Respondents are reminded that participation in this market research is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated for any portion of this market research. Respondents are also reminded that questions or comments requiring a response will have both the question/comment and Government response posted on FBO.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this contract will be continued deployment of the existing DEAMS Oracle e-Business Suite (EBS) 11i baseline AF-wide. This deployment includes development and sustainment for ongoing release work. DEAMS has determined that the currently-fielded capability comprises approximately 80% of the total DEAMS System Capability Document (SCD). The DEAMS Milestone B strategy included an Oracle eBS R12 upgrade/re-implementation to aid in achieving remaining SCD performance. However, during the 2013 Courses of Action (COA) analysis, it was determined that Oracle eBS R12 was not necessary to achieve performance described in the SCD and required in Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), Key System Attributes (KSAs), Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs), Measures of Suitability (MOSs). Implementation of the existing Oracle eBS 11i DEAMS baseline with prioritized improvements would enable the program to stay on track to meet SCD performance, KPPs, KSAs, MOEs, MOSs, IOT&E, and Full Deployment by 2017 to aid in facilitating Air Force Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) compliance. Of the remaining undeveloped 20% of DEAMS capability described in the SCD, approximately 10% will be the priority focus to improve performance described in KPPs, KSAs, MOEs, MOS and facilitate future deployments. The final 10% of capability described in the SCD will be addressed as needed in future releases after full deployment is achieved. The deferral of the Oracle eBS R12 upgrade and refocus of the development effort was most efficiently re-organized into the existing Increment 1. Increment 2 remains undefined, but will likely include the deferred Oracle upgrade and any additional or emergent SCD requirements.

This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, or performance work statements, or performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <br> INTRODUCTION <br> The US Army Communications Electronics Research & Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (STCD) is interested in receiving whitepapers for existing RF switching technology and/or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products that can support in the application of terrestrial radio communications (comms) that have the capability of switching and controlling a number of combinations of distributed antenna apertures on terrestrial Army platforms.  <br> The switch, utilizing COTS sub-components, is intended to be capable of operating at high speed and high radio frequency (RF) power and will interface to the Vehicular Integration for C4ISR/EW Interoperability (VICTORY) data bus.  The goal of this RFI is to identify vendors that can meet the specifications delineated and to understand their current technology designs and engineering tradeoffs that influences performance, size and form factor. <br> PROBLEM STATEMENT <br> In current US Army communications systems, the majority of the antennas, are single structures providing omni-directional RF coverage and are mounted in the same plane as other antennas on the top side of military platforms.  Due to this Line of Sight (LoS) placement, co-site interference can occur between systems.  In addition, current antennas are often vertical whips protruding on top of platforms creating high visibility and obstructions.   <br> CERDEC's previous development efforts to mitigate the visual signatures and the co-site interference developed distributed antenna systems.  Previous efforts replaced the single omni-directional whip with multiple low-profile/conformal directional apertures and mounted these apertures on the sides of the terrestrial vehicle.  By distributing the RF power equally amongst the apertures and placing them out of sight from the top side, omni-directional coverage could be achieved and the visual signature and the co-site interference issues alleviated. <br> However, these distributed antenna systems are not without their own shortcomings.  These antenna systems are passive and, as such, do not take full advantage of the benefits of the directional capabilities of the distributed antennas.  By using directional apertures, the system resolves the intra-vehicle co-site interference issue but did not address the inter-vehicle co-site mitigation.  Through the use of a passive splitter/combiner, the distributed system directs the RF radiation in an omni-directional pattern; however, as there is no active control of the RF path, the system does not make use of the benefits that distributed directional antennas provide such as directional networking, nulling, and increased effective isotropic radiated power. <br> To enhance the capability of these distributed antenna systems, CERDEC intends to develop a Smart RF Switch to collect intra-vehicle information from other systems and direct the RF energy using decisions based on this information.  This new Smart RF Switch will be compliance with the VICTORY standard and provide flexibility to these antenna systems. <br> SCOPE OF THIS RFI <br> For the purpose of this RFI, CERDEC is interested in gathering information in regards to technology available from the industry for developing a Smart RF Switch for inclusion in distributed antenna systems.  The need for a Smart RF Switch has been identified in previous Army developments of distributed antenna systems and the need to gather on-platform information, process commands, and direct RF energy to a directive radiating aperture. <br> To improve effectiveness and enhance the capabilities provided by these distributed apertures, a RF switch needs to be developed to control the RF path.  CERDEC's vision is to build a Smart RF Switch that can receive information and provide and receive control through the VICTORY data bus.  Based on this VICTORY provided information, the Smart RF Switch shall have the on-board intelligence to make decisions and process the distribution of the appropriate RF power levels dynamically to the corresponding apertures.  For the development effort related to this RFI, CERDEC has provided the conceptual switch representation presented in Figure 1. <br> The Smart RF Switch is broken into these functional components: <br> 1.      Victory Interface <br> 1.1.    The VICTORY interface of the Smart RF Switch shall be compatible with the VICTORY architecture and in compliance with the VICTORY Specifications. (i.e. for the Smart RF Switch to be VICTORY compatible, the design of the RF switch interface must follow the design philosophy and concepts of the VICTORY architecture. For the Smart RF Switch to be compliant with VICTORY, the interface design shall follow the VICTORY Specifications). <br> 1.2.    Inputs / Outputs <br> 1.2.1.  A single physical port shall operate as the input/output and be compliant with the VICTORY specifications. <br> 2.      Control Processing <br> 2.1.    The control processing component shall have the hardware devices to support the government furnished algorithm for controlling the RF switch matrix. This algorithm software will be developed by the government and will be housed in the control processor. Based on the decision made by the algorithm, the control processing component will control the RF Switch Matrix.  <br> 2.2.    Inputs from: <br> 2.2.1.  VICTORY: Information from the systems available on the VICTORY data bus <br> 2.2.2.  RF Switch Matrix:  Status of the switch.  This may include but is not limited to the switch states, matrix health, and antenna health. <br> 2.3.    Outputs to: <br> 2.3.1.  VICTORY:  Status of the Smart RF Switch.  This may include but is not limited to the switch state, switch health, and antenna health. <br> 2.3.2.  RF Switch Matrix:  Control for the RF switch matrix <br> 3.      RF Switch Matrix <br> 3.1.    The RF switch matrix provides a variable pathway between the single RF input and the four RF outputs.  The matrix shall allow any 1:N combination of input-to-output paths and operate over 100 - 6000 MHz.  It is the intent to use as many COTS sub-components within the switch matrix as possible.  The switch matrix must be able to monitor the health of antennas attached to the output port and report if an antenna deviates from its typical health or operation.  One such potential method is through voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) monitor however presentation of other methods is encouraged. <br> 3.2.    RF Inputs <br> 3.2.1.  Single RF input from radio <br> 3.2.2.  Must be a military standard interface <br> 3.2.3.  Can not contain any proprietary interfacing <br> 3.3.    RF Outputs <br> 3.3.1.  Four RF ports to distributed antennas <br> 3.3.2.  Must be a military standard interface <br> 3.3.3.  Can not contain any proprietary interfacing <br> 3.4.    Control Inputs/Outputs <br> 3.4.1.  Control inputs and outputs should follow guidance provided for the Control Processing Component and may use proprietary or open standard interfaces. <br> The Smart RF Switch is to be used with a variety of radio systems and, as such, CERDEC intends to identify applicable technologies that operate over these conditions.  It is understood that switching speeds, power handling, and bandwidth may be limitations and CERDEC wishes to receive information and trades between these and recommendations of technologies for inclusion. <br> Another application of this switch that CERDEC is interested in would require multiple RF inputs able to connect to any combination of multiple RF outputs.  An explanation of the applicability of the vendor's architecture and technologies shall be provided to include this capability. <br> Additionally, CERDEC is interested in understanding existing sub-component level technologies (RF switch designs, low cost component manufacturing techniques, antenna tracking and control systems, etc) that can be used to develop the intended Smart Switch distributed aperture system. <br> DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS <br> Interested parties are requested to respond to the RFI by describing their technical capabilities, displaying experience developing similar RF switch technologies.  Additionally, parties should have strong knowledge of VICTORY standard interface and show an understanding of design and manufacturing practices that have been used to reduce the costs of RF components.   <br> Interested parties are requested to submit: <br> General:  <br>        -Statement of capability <br>        -Statement of interest  <br> Qualifications: <br> Description of Qualification: Demonstrated products, projects, and applicable experience in the design, development and manufacturing of RF switches, power level control, switching control, VICTORY-compliance, and prototyping.

<DESC>The purpose of this posting is to: <br>  <br> 1. Provide the Government's responses to questions recently received from industry.  The updated Q&A log is provided as an attachment to this posting.  The recent Q&A begins at row #278 and is highlighted in yellow.   <br>  <br> Please note that all questions submitted will be posted on FebBizOpps under Q&A. Therefore, please mark any proprietary information and data submitted accordingly.  The Government reserves the right to make public any information that would provide clarification on the requirement for industry in preparing for proposals. <br>  <br> 2. Provide updated interested parties list as attached, to facilitate teaming and small business participation. <br>  <br> 3. Repost sample data from archived announcements W900KK-12-R-0000.  Please note this sample data attachment entitled,  quote mark Historical_Data quote mark  contains historical requirements data that was used by the Government in selecting the proposed NAICS code for this procurement. This information communicates in general terms the requirements, locations and estimated percent of work aligned to the TEACH PWS that can be reasonably anticipated under the TEACH IDIQ. It DOES NOT represent known requirements that will be solicited once the IDIQ contracts are awarded. <br>  <br> Proposed Small Business Strategy:  <br>  <br> The proposed TEACH IDIQ contract will be the fourth pillar contract in PEO STRI's portfolio. It also has high visibility within the Department of the Army and requires Office of the Secretary of Defense reviews and approvals at major milestones throughout the procurement process.  <br>  <br> The Government understands the significance of the TEACH small business strategy and the effect it will have on our industry partners when planning their TEACH business strategies.  As such, the Contracting Officer will provide the strategy at a point in the procurement when it is reasonable to expect that the strategy will not change significantly during higher level reviews and approvals.  <br>  <br> General Information: <br>  <br> The Government will continue to provide information, draft documentation and other program updates on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/) as they become available.   FedBizOpps is the authoritative source for this effort. Industry is highly encouraged to monitor this website for future postings.

<DESC>The proposed Train, Educate, and CoacH (TEACH) program will be a new multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (MAIDIQ) Contract for a wide range of training tasks and services to support the Warfighter Outside the Contiguous United States (OCONUS) and Continental United States (CONUS) locations. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 611430 - Professional and Management Development Training which has a small business threshold of $10 million average annual receipts.  <br>  <br> The TEACH services acquisition is to make available a broad range of services essential to train, educate and coach U.S. Army Soldiers, other Military Services personnel, Department of Defense personnel, other Federal Agencies personnel, contractor personnel, partnered nations to include Municipal City and State Government in the skills required to successfully perform mission requirements. U.S. Army needs will include individual, unit, crew and collective training support programs in order to prepare key leaders, individual soldiers, units and staff/headquarters elements to perform their full training mission.   <br>  <br> IMPORTANT: A third Task Order (TO) Performance Work Statement (PWS) is provided with this announcement for industry review. The first two TO PWSs were provided in posting dated 16 October 2013. All three TO PWSs represent a cross section of the type of requirements both in complexity and estimated dollar value anticipated for award under the TEACH MAIDIQ contracts. The potential exists for any or all of these draft requirements to be competed and awarded with the TEACH IDIQs. There are multiple reference documents and additional information related to the draft PWSs which have distribution restrictions and will be made available at a later date with request instructions. Please review the original synopsis and attachments under  quote mark Additional Info quote mark  section. <br>  <br> All communication related to TEACH acquisition shall be sent in writing to email address: TEACHacq@peostri.army.mil.

<DESC>1. Introduction
<p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for protecting the Nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. These statutory responsibilities encompass providing the most effective transportation security in the most efficient way possible as a high performing counterterrorism organization. To enhance mission performance and achieve its shared goals, TSA is committed to promoting a culture founded on integrity, innovation, and team spirit.</p>
<p>To this end, TSA requires Information Technology (IT) enterprise infrastructure support services capable of supporting the operational requirements of the agency and communications with the general public and other governmental organizations.</p>
<p>1.1 Purpose</p>
<p>Through this Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI), TSA is seeking information related to industry capabilities, best practices, technology trends, and specific information relating to managed Enterprise IT Services and other innovative end-to-end IT service delivery models.</p>
<p>Any information provided will only be used to inform TSA of the opportunities that may be available through a managed service model or other innovative IT service delivery models. Responses should include the technical pros, cons, risks, business models used, and the customer base supported via an IT service delivery model. In addition, information related to Managed Service delivery model Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and best practices for continuous improvement of IT infrastructure and operations is also requested.</p>
<p>1.2 Background and Overview</p>
<p>TSA's IT infrastructure and customers are currently supported by the IT Infrastructure Program (ITIP) contract. TSA's IT infrastructure includes a full range of services and solutions necessary to support the TSA mission. Additionally, included is support to analyze requirements, develop and implement recommended solutions, and the capability to operate and maintain legacy systems, and equipment.</p>
<p>TSA supports approximately 60,000 employees at various locations, including TSA Headquarters in Arlington, VA; approximately 550 airports and Federal Security Director (FSD) offices; international support sites; and numerous other mission critical centers and locations.</p>
<p>Approximately 85 percent of TSA users are a combination of Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) and Federal Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs), while other TSA staff includes TSA HQ employees and field security operations management and administrative support personnel.</p>
<p>2. Scope of This RFI</p>
<p>TSA is currently exploring alternate models of IT service management. Responses to this RFI are not limited to the managed services approach. Specifically TSA is seeking information about: the managed services approach and other innovative IT service delivery models; SLAs; introduction, adoption and integration of emerging technologies; Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks; and best practices. The sought information pertains to the following areas of interest:</p>
<p>&bull; Innovative IT service delivery models: The proactive delivery of service operations in an IT environment by a third party on behalf of a customer with a cost effective support model such a managed services or operations and maintenance service models.<br />&bull; Service Level Agreements (SLAs): SLAs related to the proposed service delivery model, preferably SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-bound), and metrics are required from both provider and end-user perspectives. Qualitative, as well as quantitative, SLAs/OLAs, metrics, and standards are anticipated.<br />&bull; Introduction, adoption and integration of emerging technologies: Includes the onboarding of emerging technologies and services; modernizing or sunsetting of legacy IT systems infrastructure; transitioning to "X as a Service" (XaaS ) (to include transitioning to DHS or another government agency as a service provider) and embracing cloud computing.<br />&bull; EA frameworks: Industry recognized and recommended EA frameworks for IT service delivery, (e.g., COBIT , ISO/IEC 2000 , IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) , etc.) and any enterprise architecture framework employed (e.g., DoD Architecture Framework (DODAF) , The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) ), as reference models. <br />&bull; Best practices: Any additional IT methods or techniques that have consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other techniques to deliver cost-efficient, mission focused, customer-centric IT services, as demonstrated by experience.</p>
<p>3. Information Requested</p>
<p>TSA seeks information from the IT industry to ensure that its future solicitations regarding the acquisition of enterprise IT services, definitions of objectives and requirements, related performance metrics, and terms are clear, reasonable, and understood. A primary objective is to determine the most desirable and logical approach for moving forward in a manner that enables TSA to continuously transform the IT infrastructure that supports optimization and modernization from a mission, technical, financial and environmental perspective. Additional objectives of this RFI are to:</p>
<p>&bull; Explore the technical solutions available in the marketplace to meet organizational needs and improve the effectiveness of IT operations and maintenance<br />&bull; Explore innovative IT solutions in the identified areas that the agency could benefit<br />&bull; Assess industry capabilities to meet TSA's mission needs<br />&bull; Allow vendors an opportunity to respond to questions in this RFI to assist TSA in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy</p>

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

<AWARDEE>ReddingSteel,LLC, 90 White Oak Dr, Southington, CT 06489-3834 US
<DESC><strong><br />CONTRACT TEPA13-29898 has been awarded based on the authority below:<br /></strong><br /><strong>AUTHORITY:</strong> FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1)
<p><strong><br />REQUIREMENT:</strong> The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) Office of Engraving, Plate Manufacturing Division has a requirement to purchase the following item - Steel Material: Federal Reserve Seal and Treasury Seal of various sizes (see requisition) from Redding Steel.</p>
<p>The BEP requires these parts within four (4) weeks from award. The independent government cost estimate (IGCE) is estimated at $18,000.00.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE:</strong> BEP is a component of the Department of the Treasury that designs, engraves, and prints U.S. banknote currency and other U.S. security products. Banknote currency manufacturing occurs at BEP's Eastern Currency Facility (ECF) located in Washington, DC and WCF located in Fort Worth, TX. BEP's primary customer is the Federal Reserve Board (FRB).</p>
<p>The BEP purpose of the purchase of steel material used in plate making on the Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) process for the manufacture of Treasury and Federal Reserve seals for currency production. This sole source acquisition will provide continuity of supplies for the manufacture of U.S. currency.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTIFICATION:</strong> In this instance, the nature of the acquisition and/or circumstances surrounding this acquisition requires the use of the authority cited above as follows:</p>
<p>1. Nature of the Acquisition<br />a. BEP is currently in the process of renewing the Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) for the supply of steel material. It is anticipated that a new competed BPA (including testing) will be in place in the second quarter of FY 14. This single purchase is for the continuity of steel material until such a time that the competitive contract vehicle is in place. <br />i. The current BPA has reached its ceiling and therefore cannot be used for this purchase. Therefore, a single purchase is required to allow of continuity of supply while a new BPA is put in place. <br />b. The steel material is required to have a high level of purity and be heat treated (the process of heating steel to gain the necessary hardness). The steel material used during the manufacturing process for plate making cannot contain any impurities or the EDM process will fail resulting in the steel material being completely replaced and lengthy process fully repeated as a cost of material, time and effort for the BEP. <br />2. Unique Qualifications <br />a. Redding Steel's steel material was previously found technically acceptable as it meets the stringent purity and heat treatment requirements. Currently, Redding Steel is the only manufacturer which is an approved source of supply for steel material. <br />b. Other steel manufacturers as alternate sources of supplies for steel material have been previously tested and to date none have been found to meet the required purity and heat treatment requirements. <br />c. Any alternate source which is identified that could meet the purity and heat treatment requirements will require an amount of time and effort as well as costs expended to submit material samples for testing and evaluation. It is anticipated that these efforts will be completed within six (6) months under the competitive BPA acquisition. <br />i. However, in order to meet the demands of the currency manufacturing, the continuity of supplies is needed during the testing and evaluation effort.</p>
<p>Overall, based on the above only the proposed source can meet BEP's need.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER:</strong> This requirement does not result from a lack of planning or expiration of funds. This requirement is the result of a defined need to purchase steel materials used in the manufacturing of U.S. currency.</p>
<p>BEP anticipates that the price will be fair and reasonable based on comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases and comparison to an independent Government estimate.</p>
<p><strong>DETERMINATION</strong>: In summary, based on the above the establishment of a Purchase Order with the proposed source is in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<DESC>This Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) was awarded as a single-source IDIQ contract to the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) with an ordering period of one year plus two one-year optional ordering periods for an estimated contract value of $9,000,000. JHU/APL's UARC will provide technologies for the interdiction of Chemical/Biological/Radiological/Nuclear/High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Material. DTRA will leverage off the core competencies of JHU/APL's UARC to resolve specific critical challenges identified on individual task orders.<br /><br />This IDIQ contract contains Cost and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type line items (CLINs) to accommodate Research and Development efforts of a nature that involves uncertainties in contract performance and does not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed-price order.<br /><br />This IDIQ was awarded as a non-competitive action. The Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be posted separately under FedBizOpps. The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is: 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3, Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services. Per FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii), Full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center. As a DoD-chartered UARC, JHU/APL has maintained core competencies that create the essential engineering, research and development capabilities required to meet DoD agencies' mission needs. The scope of DTRA's requirements fall under the core competencies of JHU/APL's UARC.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY
<p><br />1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: This is a Limited Source Justification. The Naval Medical Logistics Command, acting on behalf of the Navy Medicine Information Systems Support Activity, intends to award a delivery order against NASA SEWP contract, pursuant to the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.</p>
<p>2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF CONTRACT ACTION: This is a limited source action to procure a one year subscription of AppDNA software and maintenance for use by up to 60,000 Navy Medicine users. This software can be purchased through any authorized reseller of AppDNA. The Government intends on awarding a Firm Fixed Price delivery order.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The proposed acquisition is to acquire AppDNA software and maintenance for use by up to 60,000 Navy Medicine users. This software performs application compatibility testing and provides remediation solutions. This allows users to test application compatibility of their existing applications against the new Navy Medicine Windows 7 Operating System baseline. It also provides users the ability to test any new or proposed applications for compatibility against the Navy Medicine Windows 7 OS baseline.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE AND/OR DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: The statutory authority which permits restricting consideration of schedule contractors to fewer than that required in FAR 16.5, as implemented by FAR 16.505-(b)(2)(ii) (B) item peculiar to one manufacturer. <br />The proposed brand name only requirement is to acquired a one year subscription of AppDNA software and maintenance for use by to 60,000 Navy Medicine users.<br />AppDNA's unique requirements include:<br />- Provides the ability to over-ride the Red/Amber/Green test results if required as opposed to no ability to override<br />- Provides flexible reporting options within the console to view and group applications as opposed to exporting into another tool for analysis<br />- Provides a single view within the console to view the compatibility of all applications with all platforms as opposed to exporting to another tool for analysis</p>
<p>- Allows multiple users to simultaneously access AppDNA as opposed to one user at a time.<br />- Enables importing of Navy Medicine Windows 7 OS baseline images and extracts the DNA from these for use in testing. Applications can be tested in the context of the actual operating system configuration on which they will run versus testing against an out of the box Windows 7 Operating System configuration. <br />- Analyzes applications and then intelligently provides suggestions for optimal approaches for remediation. This may be one of 3 approaches: generate a transform file for the specific application, apply a "shim" to the operating system or change the configuration of the operating system build. This intelligent remediation ensures the optimal approach is provided based on the analysis of all applications, providing the most scalable solution requiring the least change to the applications and minimizing the cost and risk of migration. This is opposed to other products providing only a single approach to remediation.</p>
<p>- AppDNA is the only product that can integrate with Microsoft's Application Compatibility Database (used by Navy Medicine) and can present this information to further enhance its test results. It also integrates with Microsoft Systems Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) and Active Directory allow AppDNA to map compatibility with organizational structure enabling applications to be grouped and prioritized for testing in line with the organization structure defined within ConfigMgr. <br />- AppDNA is the only application compatibility product that has gone through the Navy Medicine governance process for use within Navy Medicine.</p>
<p>5. DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE: In accordance with FAR 16.505, NASA SEWP has already determined the prices of equipment and fixed price services of the schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing. The Naval Medical Logistics Command, Fort Detrick Contracting Officer will determine, using the procedures in FAR 15.4, that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs. The contracting officer may, also, seek additional discounts before placing the order.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH: This product is available via the NASA SEWP GWAC.</p>
<p>7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: This procurement uses a NASA SEWP Schedule and will be solicited and awarded in accordance with FAR Subpart 16.505.</p>
<p>8. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION: All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis. As the barriers that preclude the agency from the requirements of section 16.5 is due to limited vendors on NASA SEWP GWAC, no actions can be taken by this agency to remove those barriers. If additional vendors are added to the NASA SWEP for this item, they will be considered as applicable.</p>

<DESC><p>To inform federal and state policy decisions, ASPE is seeking to continue its work with RAND to enhance its capacity for simulation of specific health reform provisions such as the establishment of new health insurance exchanges and the expansion of Medicaid eligibility. The time frames for particular technical assistance requests could range from less than a day to several months. Deliverables may include tables of estimates with accompanying documentation of methods and assumptions; short issue briefs; or longer white papers, as determined by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). Deliverables may be released to the public or held for internal ASPE use, as directed by the COR.</p>
<p>This contract will give ASPE continued access to the RAND COMPARE microsimulation model, which has already been thoroughly tested, revised, and used to estimate the effects of health reform proposals. The model is capable of simulating behavioral responses to policy changes by individuals, employers, or insurers. This follow-on work may explore the addition of model inputs such as administrative data for the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which are not currently components of the COMPARE model.</p>
<p>Outputs shall include estimates of the number of uninsured and the sources of coverage for the insured; eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP and for employer-sponsored coverage; premiums for large group, small group, and individual private coverage; and federal and state health care spending. The model shall allow the Contractor to simulate alternative scenarios in which Affordable Care Act provisions are and are not in effect in order to assess the impact of those provisions</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of the increase in scope of this task order is to obtain additional systems administration resources to address the IT security findings stemming from a recent IT security audit. The Corps needs specialized programming and systems administration services: 1.) to maintain its Commissioned Corps Business Process Management (CCBPM) system, which uses a heavily-customized instance of the OpenText Global 360 software to run its Board activities; and 2.) to run and maintain the Corps' electronic Official Personnel Files. Technical personnel who perform programming and systems administration services must have training and extensive experience in both OpenText Global 360 software and with the heavily customized CCBPM system in order to provide satisfactory service.</p>
<p>The justification is for this limited source acquisition is FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C): "In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA must not have been previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures."</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 8.405-6 (a)(2) -- Limited Sources, the attached Limited Sources Justification form is bieng publicly posted for a minimum of 30 days. NOTE: This posting was delayed due to the (temporary) partial Government shutdown that ended on October 17, 2013.</p>
