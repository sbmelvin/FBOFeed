<DESC>This RFI is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation for applications or an obligation on the part of the government. The government will not pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the government's use of that information.  The 554 ELSG/PN Program Office is seeking information from industry regarding possible technical approaches to provide Air Force personnel data to future Air Force or DOD information systems from AF legacy systems using a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).  This data may be used for new requirements for personnel records, training, and other operational systems requiring this data. Currently, this data is stored in many AF legacy systems.  The contractor will provide the integration to retrieve personnel data from an authoritative data source without having to recreate this data in the projected new system or requirement. The developer/integrator of these SOA services would also be the integrato! r of future requirements within the projected timeframe. The 554 ELSG Program Office is especially interested in creative suggestions, even if they involve radical changes to the current approach.

<DESC><p>This is a sole source requirement to IHS Global (cage code: 6A920). A requirement exists to contract for services necessary to support the Air Force Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) parts configuration data conversion activities.&nbsp; This effort is for the conversion of indentured parts records contained in Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB) documents for uploading to the Parts Configuration Management System.&nbsp; To reduce the percentage of errors during the conversion process, an automated rules processor will be utilized.&nbsp; The automated rules processor will use source data from Haystack, a commercially owned logistics database owned by IHS Global. IHS is the only source capable of performing actions necessary to clean-up Master BOM data in a timely manner, which is fundamental for successful implementation of ECSS.&nbsp;The validation&nbsp; of the captured IPB data is an automated process that compares data for thousands of parts with those from the Haystack source database and updates the captured IPB data if discrepancies are founds.&nbsp; The validataion process via the rules processor requires access to source data from Haystack for a complete database of up-to-date parts information.&nbsp; This internal source code, which manages and interfaces the source database to its external applications, is the intellectual property of IHS Global. The Government will be setting up an IDIQ contract with a two (2)&nbsp;year ordering period&nbsp;with IHS Global for this requirement. This will not be a recurring&nbsp;requirement.&nbsp;Questions regarding this requirement should be sent to&nbsp;Brandi Morris at <a href="mailto:brandi.morris@robins.af.mil">brandi.morris@robins.af.mil</a>.&nbsp; Email responses are preferred.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for one new Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and toobtain the services to reconfigure an existing IMU to NASAs performance requirements of10 Hz Input/Output, and 4 Degrees/Second Range.

The new IMU is required to interface with an existing NASA system.  Thecurrently owned LN-200s have been extensively tested and are baselined for the LunarAtmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission.  To develop a custom interfaceusing an IMU other than the LN-200 would require substantial cost and labor.  Procuringmultiple units from another manufacturer would require duplication of the completedcharacterization testing.  Only Northrop Grumman can reconfigure the existing LN-200 IMUto NASAs performance requirement.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing only to:  Wilfredo Querida (Wilfredo.Querida@nasa.gov) not later than4:30 p.m. Pacific time on August 6, 2009.

<DESC>A. Background

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to provide Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition CFSAN with a broad overview of the presence, frequency and levels of microbial pathogens in foods with emphasis on produce commodities. Outbreaks due to the contamination of produce have received a heightened interest from the American public.   

B. Scope of Work 

The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has specific regulatory responsibilities directed at ensuring the safety of food, food additive, dietary supplement, and cosmetic products.  In part, CFSAN maintains an active research program for the purpose of developing and applying technologies to detect, to identify and evaluate microbial hazards that may contaminate products either naturally or intentionally. 

This contract is intended to provide CFSAN with a broad overview of the presence, frequency and levels of microbial pathogens in foods with emphasis on produce commodities. Outbreaks due to the contamination of produce have received a heightened interest from the American public. This contract should provide significant data on the prevalence of selected bacterial pathogens in a wide variety of produce commodities and a broad view of the presence of Salmonella in tomatoes.  The overarching objectives of this contract are to provide significant baseline data of potential microbiological hazards associated with the consumption of raw and minimally processed produce and to identify other microbial-related environmental and food-related risks.  

In order to better understand how pervasive microbial pathogens are in fresh produce commodities the objective of this contract is to analyze selected foods for the presence of Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7.  As for ready-to-eat (RTE) foods, our focus will be on Listeria monocytogenes. Our plans include the generation of a database for these select produce as to the frequency of isolation/detection of the aforementioned pathogens in each commodity as it relates to its geographical location and growing season. 

The emphasis of this contract is to focus on obtaining data that will reflect a broader scope of the frequency and levels of bacteriological human pathogens that have historically been associated with fresh produce commodities and a variety of RTE foods. In order to better understand how pervasive microbial pathogens are in fresh produce commodities the objective of this contract is to analyze selected foods for the presence of Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7.  As for RTE foods, our focus will be on Listeria monocytogenes. Our plans include the generation of a database for these select produce as to the frequency of isolation/detection of the aforementioned pathogens in each commodity as it relates to its geographical location and growing season. 

The impact of such data collection could have an affect on any Produce Safety Regulatory Options Developed by FDA with the following parameters: Consistent across the U.S., based on sound science, overarching (most commonly consumed fresh produce), accommodate specifics (commodity, region, operations, practices, size of establishment), and allow the U.S. to meet its obligations under WTO SPS.

C. Additional Information 

 It is anticipated that one (1)  Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded with a one (1) year base period and four (4) option years. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). FDA anticipates release of the RFP on or around May 8, 2009 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before or after July 1, 2009.

<DESC>Angelus Oaks Understory Burn Project, Decision Document with FONSI or Decision Memo.

A.  Introduction
This performance-based Work Statement defines the effort required to secure professional services to manage an Inter-disciplinary Team (IDT), conduct environmental analysis and public involvement, and prepare a NEPA Decision Document with FONSI or Decision Memo for a project to reduce fire hazard on the San Bernardino National Forest, Front Country Ranger District, surrounding Angelus Oaks, California. The project will be analyzed using Forest Service Categorical Exclusion FSH 1909.15, 31.2 (6) in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). However, should analysis of cumulative watershed impacts and cumulative impacts to spotted owls indicate the need for an Environmental Assessment the project may be changed to an Environmental Assessment (EA). This requires two bid estimates one for Categorical Exclusion and the other for Environmental Assessment for the project.  
Background:
The Angelus Oaks Understory burn is located in an area classified as Wildland-Urban-Interface by the San Bernardino National Forest. Under the National Fire Plan and the Healthy Forest Initiative, emphasis is placed on reducing the risk of wildfire within the urban interface around communities at risk. The area is approximately 535 acres in size.  
The suppression of low intensity fires for the past 100 years has resulted in a forest condition where the vegetation is denser, ladder fuels are abundant, and there are accumulations of woody material. Some parts of the project area are exceeding the carrying capacity resulting in vegetation mortality.
In addition, the San Bernardino National Forest has experienced  drought in recent years, the effects of which are still evident.  A drought is a natural phenomenon; however, when vegetation density exceeds the carrying capacity, many trees and shrubs are unable to withstand drought conditions.  This leads to  mortality resulting in the current forest conditions with high levels of fuel loading.   
Project Location
The Angelus Oaks Understory Burn Project is located along Highway 38 in the San Bernardino National Forest, San Bernardino County, California.  The 535 acre project area surrounds the community of Angelus Oaks in Township 1N, Range 1W, Sections 21, 22, 27, 28, 33, and 34.

Purpose and Need for the Project
The Front Country Ranger District of the San Bernardino National Forest is proposing to understory burn the shaded fuel break areas created during the implementation of the Angelus Oaks Community Defense Project initiated in 2004.

The objectives are to reduce fuel loading due to post-implementation activity residue, resprouting shrub and herbaceous vegetation, as well as improve the overall forest health of the treated areas using prescribed fire to help restore ecological balance.

Existing Conditions
The project consists of mixed conifer of primarily Ponderosa Pine, Sugar Pine, White Fir, Incense Cedar, Coulter Pine and Big Cone Douglas Fir with an oak component of Black Oak, and Live Oak.  Mortality removal and thinning from below have been previously implemented. This material was stacked and has been or will be burned in piles. Mechanical treatment by mastication also occurred in some units with residual activity fuels remaining on site. Post-treatment re-sprouting of the understory vegetation is occurring and will increasingly degrade the integrity of the fuel breaks.
  
Desired Conditions

The project will result in a mosaic of differing vegetative age classes within the project area.  The project will maintain an open stand appearance with variable density and structure restoring a low intensity fire regime; more closely resembling the historic norms. The open stand conditions are sought to: limit hazardous fuels conditions; and maintain visual enjoyment for local residents and tourist.  Overall species composition will remain through natural regeneration and sprouting after treatment activities have been conducted.  The uneven age classes will aid in controlling future wildfires by breaking up vertical and horizontal continuity of fuels and reducing the fire severity.



Project Objectives
The major objectives of this performance-based Task Order are to:
a)	Procure a proposed action within constraints identified in this Scope of Work that is economically feasible and can reasonably be implemented.
b)	Manage public involvement for the project, including content analysis of public comments and documenting response to comments.
c)	Procure specialist reports necessary to support a Decision Document with FONSI or Decision Memo.
d)	Procure a technically and legally defensible NEPA Decision Document  with FONSI or Decision Memo in 100% compliance with law, regulation and policy, so that the Deciding Officer may make an informed decision on how best to accomplish the management objectives described in the Forest Plan, as amended, regarding the reduction of hazardous fuels on NFS lands.  The NEPA document must document compliance with the Forest Land Management Plan (LMP) and with FSH 1909.15, 30.3(2) regarding extraordinary circumstances. The NEPA Document must document, and the specialist reports must support, the following:
i.	Whether extraordinary circumstances exist;
ii.	Whether there is a cause-effect relationship between the proposed action and the potential effect on the resource conditions covered by extraordinary circumstances; and
iii.	If such a relationship exists, the degree of the potential effect on these resource conditions.
Project Proposed Action
The Front Country Ranger District of the San Bernardino National Forest is proposing to understory burn the shaded fuel break areas created during the implementation of the Angelus Oaks Community Defense Project initiated in 2004.

The objectives are to reduce fuels loading due to post-implementation activity residue, resprouting shrub and herbaceous vegetation, as well as improve the overall health of the treated areas while re-introducing fire as an ecological process.

Prescribed Burn: Chaparral would be burned to maintain 40%-60% vegetation ground cover providing a continuous mosaic of fuels.  Prescribed burning would be generally of low intensity using hand firing devices and heli-torch methods.  The project includes analysis of additional treatments to maintain desired conditions over time.. 

This is a cascading Hubzone Set-Aside. HubZone and Service-disabled Veteran-owned Businesses will be evaluated equally. Both will be given a 10% price differential over other Small Businesses. The solicitation will be avaialble on FEDBIZOPS on or about August 3, 2009

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Process Measurements Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Coherent, Inc., to replace the ceramic-sealed plasma tube on a Coherent Optical Parametric Amplification System.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently utilizes an Optical Parametric Amplification system.  The ceramic-sealed plasma tube within the argon-ion subsystem has malfunctioned and must be replaced.  The plasma tube is a proprietary product of the system.  There are no off-the-shelf equivalents, and Coherent is the only supplier of the replacement parts for this system.  Therefore, the plasma tube must be 100 percent compatible with the existing system.  Coherent, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the plasma tube that is required to satisfy the Governments minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334515, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by August 3, 2009, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p class="MsoNormal">The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Hormonal and
Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB) plans to procure on a sole source basis
Breast and colorectal cancer trends as a function of menopausal hormone therapy
(MPH) and cancer screening among female members of the two large health plans
in the United States with Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC); 1800
Harrison St., FL 16; Oakland, California 94612-3433.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for
acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to
use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR
13.501.The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the
business size standard is $7.0 million.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The unprecedented decline in U.S. female breast cancer incidence
rates after 2002 may be caused by the reduced use of menopausal hormone therapy
(MHT), a known risk factor for breast cancer. The HREB lab has attempted to
uncover an explanation for the change in rates, and earlier ecologic analyses
strongly pointing to reduced use of MHT among women as the most likely cause of
the recent decline in incidence rates. However, ecologic analyses are subject
to particular bias and the ecologic fallacy, and even a methodologically strong
ecologic analysis will not be able to sufficiently identify the likely cause of
the recent change in incidence rates. The best method for pursuing these
questions is to utilize existing data from managed health care settings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The purpose of this procurement
is to finalize age-specific breast cancer incidence rates and rate trends among
specific subgroups of women defined by MHT use and screening mammography,
accounting both for specific equivalent MHT types over time and potential
pre-invasive breast neoplasias; identify whether any known or suspected breast
cancer risk factors are associated with recent changes in MHT use or
mammographic screening behavior to the extent that might operate as important
confounders of observed changes in rates; and, based on summary final data to
emerge from this project, collaborate with NCI&rsquo;s CISNET group to develop or
test population-based statistical models that evaluate the influence of MHT use
on the natural history of breast cancer and the influence of MHT cessation on
breast cancer incidence rates.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Period of Performance shall be twelve months from date of
award.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">KPNC has a large membership base to include sufficient
numbers of women ages 45 years or older (an estimated 650,000) to, when
combined with the Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) population, provide stable
and reliable analysis of recent trends in incidence rates according to MHT use
and screening behavior.<span>&nbsp; </span>Existing
etiologic studies within the NCI&rsquo;s DCEG are individually too small to accomplish
this aim and collectively too disparate to justify effectively pooling the
data.<span>&nbsp; </span>KPNS has regional offices
throughout the U.S.
with databases, data procedures, and data quality that can be easily searched,
using algorithms, codes, and operational definitions developed by the NCI and
KPNW, with input from KPNC, to generate extensively detailed data on individual
members&rsquo; histories of MHT use, screening behavior, and subsequent cancer
incidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>KPNC investigators have experience
conducting analyses that are relevant to the questions under study here, and
the KPNC investigators have the knowledge of the specific critical KPNC data
that will be used for this analysis.<span>&nbsp; </span>KPNC
is the only known contactor to the NCI who can perform the required tasks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if
any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit
a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other
information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The Genetics Branch of the Center for Cancer Research at the National Cancer Institute is engaged in investigating genetic alteration and its effect on the development and biology of cancer. The purpose of this acquisition is to procure a BioMark System MX Package to comply with the Next-generation sequencing currently in use in the lab. While next-generation sequencing is an incredibly powerful tool, much of the genome is uninformative and therefore valuable time, labor and resources are expended fruitlessly. The Genetics Branch requires an instrument with the ability to select on more focused regions of the genome, which would allow a greater discovery rate and facilitate analysis of a greater number of samples while maximizing labor and reagent efficiencies. The BioMark System MX Package encompasses the power to control and perform the tasks needed to carry out the mission of the Genetics Lab and their study of the biology of cancer efficiently. The system with Fluidigm includes a one year software license for 20 seats; one year maintenance plan for all parts and software including technical support; installation; standard training including overview and in-depth instruction for 1.5 days for up to 5 users; 2 Integrated Fluidic (IFC) controllers (pre & post Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)  sample harvest capable); and access arrays to enable intersection of 48 samples with primer pairs for in-chip amplification. Following completion of PCR, amplicons are pooled in sample specific fashion.

<CONTACT>Melissa P Marino, Phone 301-402-4509, Fax 301-402-4513, Email marinome@mail.nih.gov - Caren N Rasmussen, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email cr214i@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) intends to procure on a sole-source basis a BD LSR II laser upgrade with BD Biosciences, 2350 Qume Dr., San Jose, CA 95131.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology is a large translational research laboratory that conducts research in the areas of tumor immunology, mechanisms of tumor cell-immune cell interactions, and immune mechanisms. The laboratory functions as an integrated translational research program with the goal of designing and developing new immunotherapies and immunologic strategies for cancer treatment and prevention. One crucial piece of equipment used by multiple investigators is the BD Biosciences LSRII flow cytometer.  The flow cytometer is used by many investigators and provides crucial experimental data on the expression of antigen by a variety of cells as well as their functional characteristics.  The data is important in the overall assessment of the efficacy of different vaccine modalities to elicit a host immune response.</p>
<p>The current LSR II flow cytometer in LTIB has two lasers (blue laser/488nm and red laser/633nm). There is a limitation of only 6-color flow cytometric analysis with the two lasers. The laboratory analyzes patient samples pre and post vaccination for monitoring of specific immune responses. More than 6-color will be needed for the phenotypic analysis of markers. Additional lasers (violet laser and UV laser) are needed for the use of additional fluorochromes (Pacific blue, AmCyan, Marine blue, Alexa Fluor 405, Cascade blue, Cascade yellow, CEP and Alexa Fluor 430) and DNA analysis as well as calcium flux for the functional analysis of T effector and Treg cells. Multiple markers are needed for the identification of specific subpopulations of T cells, such as central and effector memory, na&iuml;ve T cells, and memory and na&iuml;ve Tregs.  Current configuration of our LSR II will not allow LTIB to perform this study. Additional color capability will allow LTIB to study the subpopulations that are responding or not responding to the vaccine treatment. Addition of these lasers to the current LSR II flow cytometer will facilitate the clinical monitoring of patients immune responses due to vaccination and the generation of more valuable information for the design of clinical trials. Similar studies are also ongoing using mouse models in LTIB.  Additional lasers will greatly facilitate the mouse model studies as well.</p>
<p>The proposed upgrade will add functionality to the existing FACSLSRII flow cytometer by increasing the number of features and areas of interest on each cell type under investigation. The current configuration of the instrument allows for study of six dyes on each cell simultaneously. The violet laser upgrade will add four additional colors that can be detected. Software will also be included. This upgrade will consist of a 405nm laser, a 355nm laser, electronics to power the lasers and optics for laser beam induced cell signal detection. The upgrade is only available direct from BD Biosciences, who is the original manufacturer of the LSRII cytometer. This upgrade is integrated into nearly every system of the cytometer which is the reason it is available only from the manufacturer. BD Biosciences, manufacturer of the FACSLSRII flow cytometer sells both instruments and upgrades directly to the end user and does not use distributors. <br />For these reasons, the upgrade needs to be purchased from BD Biosciences as there is no other known source.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on August 4, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration/certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-90127-MM on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>Naval Sea Systems Command is contemplating award of a sole source Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to ITT Electronic Systems, Inc. 3500 Willow Lane, Thousand Oaks, CA, 91361 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "only one responsible source and no other supply or services will satisfy agency requirements."  The procurement will be in support of the military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.   The Department of Defense (DoD) has identified a requirement for increased protection from Radio Controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (RCIEDs).  The DoD requires a Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) system capable of protecting against new advancing Radio Frequency (RF) threats, and support rapid installation and operation on various DoD vehicles.  The requirement is to provide an upgrade to the existing CREW Vehicle Receiver Jammer (CVRJ) thereby increasing performance capabilities, improving protection for our personnel, through "Band C" and is ready for immediate production (Technology Readiness Level of 8 or better).  Space constraints on existing DoD vehicles mandate any performance improvements result in minimum impact on the existing CREW system's footprints.  Accordingly, DoD requires an integrated single box CREW system capable of operating through "Band C" and is ready for immediate production (Technology Readiness Level of 8 or better).  
ITT has developed an upgrade kit which integrates with the existing CVRJ to provide the required performance improvements.  No data package currently exists for this requirement.  The Navy has completed required testing on the upgraded CVRJ kit and determined it is ready for production and fielding.  The kit design will allow ITT to rapidly integrate the upgrade into its existing CVRJ production line and to provide upgrade kits for existing systems and/or upgraded CVRJ systems capable of addressing the advancing threats in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  
This will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with options to produce up to 8,000 upgraded CVRJ systems (either through upgrade kits or upgrade of CVRJ systems already on contract) and approximately 2000 hours of engineering support services to support final integration.  The minimum order quantity will be 669.  Delivery of minimum base amount is required within 5 months of receipt of contract, with subsequent deliveries four months after receipt of order.  Delivery location is Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, IN, 47522.  The period of performance is anticipated to run from award in fourth quarter Government Fiscal Year 2009 through third quarter Government Fiscal Year 2011. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Reference solicitation number N00024-09-R-6314.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Responses to this notice must be received by 10:00 a.m. local time on 20 AUGUST 2009.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to karen.giunta@navy.mil or tara.mccarron@navy.mil.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<a href="mailto:milton.washington@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>Constructive Training Systems (CTS)  Updated Status & Current Draft Documents.<BR><BR>Brief Summary: The US Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Acquisition Center in Orlando, FL is developing an acquisition strategy to award a 5-year (1 year base with 4 one year options) Constructive Training Systems (CTS) single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The resulting contract will be Firm Fixed Price with Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Time & Mateiral provisions.  This effort will enable the Project Manager (PM) Constructive Simulation (ConSim) to execute its mission of acquiring, fielding and sustaining the constructive simulations used to support the Army's command and staff training requirements. The CTS contractor will provide constructive training systems as well as technical, management and professional engineering support services, for the Common Battle Command Simulation Equipment (CBCSE), Battle Command Training Capability-Equipment Support (BCTC-ES) and Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC) programs, which form the base of the CTS effort.<BR><BR>Background: JLCCTC is a software modeling and simulation capability that contributes to the joint training functional concept and the Army training mission area by providing the appropriate levels of model and simulation resolution and fidelity needed to support both Army and Joint training requirements. JLCCTC is comprised of two separate federations, Multi Resolution Federation (MRF) and Entity Resolution Federation (ERF). JLCCTC-MRF is a federated set of constructive simulation software supported by commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware (HW) and software (SW) products. JLCCTC-MRF supports the training of commanders and their staffs in maneuver, logistics, intelligence, air defense and artillery. The federate models are connected by a combination of the standard High-Level Architecture (HLA), Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI), Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), custom interfaces, the corps battle staff Master Interface (MI) and Point-to- Point (PTP). The JLCCTC-MRF is a Command Post Exercise (CPX) driver designed to train Army commanders and their staffs at division through echelons above corps. JLCCTC-MRF provides the simulated operational environment in which computer generated forces stimulate and respond to the command and control processes of the commanders and staffs. The JLCCTC-MRF models will provide full training functionality for leader and battle staff for the Army and the Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and Multinational (JIIM) spectrum. JLCCTC-MRF provides an interface to Battle Command (BC) equipment allowing commanders and their staffs to train with their go to war systems. JLCCTC-ERF is a federation of constructive simulations, BC interfaces, data collection and After Action Review (AAR) tools. It stimulates the BC systems to facilitate battle staff collective training by requiring staff reaction to incoming digital information while executing the commanders tactical plan. The targeted training audience is comprised of brigade and battalion battle staffs, functional Command Post (CP) training, and full CP training. The JLCCTC new equipment training (NET) and fielding will be conducted utilizing a Hub and Spoke concept. There are 13 Hubs and the number of spokes varies from 0-4 for each Hub. NET will be conducted at the Hub during a 3-week period. Spokes will send their key personnel to the Hub to receive the NET.<BR><BR>CBCSE is a fundamental element of JLCCTC. CBCSE procures the COTS HW & SW products and network devices in support of the JLCCTC program and provides infrastructure upgrades as required for US Army Battle Command Training Centers worldwide. CBCSE procures common hardware platforms (CHP) capable of running each version of fielded JLCCTC software in support of Army constructive simulation programs to stimulate the Armys Command and Control (C2) communication systems to meet command and staff training requirements. Viability is ensured through a Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) process in conjunction with the JLCCTC simulation SW VV&A. CBCSE SW includes COTS operating systems, databases and desk top software. CBCSE has supported additional customer requirements in the past with the procurement of COTS HW and SW to support the establishment of two Battle Command Training Distributed Systems, the Defense Acquisition Universitys Simulation and Training Conference Facility located at Ft Belvoir, VA and US Marine Corps PM Training Systems Combined Arms Command and Control Training Upgrade Systems project.<BR><BR>BCTC-ES provides network equipment and technical tools that enhance the integration of constructive simulations to Army C2 systems, extend units communications capabilities, integrates C2 white boxes into Tactical Operation Center (TOC) sets, provides visualization of the common operating picture (COP) and ensures simulation-C2 thread functionality. BCTC-ES is the enabling link within a BCTC that supports JLCCTC/C2 stimulation. BCTC-ES components may be provided individually, in conjunction with a JLCCTC-ERF fielding, or as part of a new Military Construction, Army (MCA) BCTC. BCTC-ES provides significant battle command capability enhancement to include: networks internal to the BCTC Wide Area Network (WAN); Local Area Network (LAN) additions of and distribution to external TOC pads; training classrooms; Local Training Areas & remote sites; Radio-Wire Integration Systems to link constructive player work cells with a unit TOC across combat radio nets; Packet Radio Units both fixed and mobile to transmit virtual Unmanned Aerial Vehicle data/video between BCTC and a remote TOC; C2 Servers to link C2 white boxes into unit and HICON / EXCON TOC sets; and battle sight visualization tool to provide video feeds of simulations and/or C2 systems. In addition to the BCTC-ES requirements noted above, the new BCTC MCA projects will require the procurement of COTS HW, SW, furniture and infrastructure elements required to support the conducting of Battle Command Training. <BR><BR>This effort will require temporary duty worldwide to conduct JLCCTC new equipment training (NET) and fielding, field and NET for BCTC-ES components, support BCTC MCA projects and perform infrastructure upgrades. Security clearances up to and including Top Secret will be required to perform work under this contract. <BR><BR>This announcement does not constitute a request for proposal at this time. <BR><BR>There are draft documents attached that are intended to provide general CTS scope information.  The draft documents are correct and accurate at this point for the purpose intended.  The Government intends to utilize a single award IDIQ contract instrument to meet the CTS requirement under full & open competition.  It is the Governments intent to post a Request for Proposal (RFP) within the next 30 days.  In the coming weeks we will continue to post draft documents as information becomes available.  All potential offerors are encouraged to continually monitor this site for updates.  No responses are required.  This notice provides presolicitation information only.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<br />---------------<br />A. General Information<br />The Heartland Region seeks approval to initiate the standardization process for Suction Catheters and Tips for its 7 Army, Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and US Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF's) in the states of Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan in the Heartland Region including institutional and operational healthcare settings. Standardization action for this product line represents a new initiative. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFQ). Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed in 1a of the Technical Criteria below, will be disqualified in Phase I.
<p>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program. The seven facilities in the area include Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky, Naval Hospital Corps School Great Lakes Illinois, and USCG Air Station Traverse City Michigan.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Regions current PV Owens &amp; Minor. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their products. This RFQ will result in a Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) that is a supplement to the PV Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's PV program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is November 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<br />Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>B. Products and Performance Required<br />The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Suction Catheters and Tips, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $27,470.42. This forecast is based on historical CDMIA sales for a 12-month period. The top-ten (10) high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below. At the request of the Heartland Regional MTF's vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075. All e-mail communication between vendors and the Region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Heartland Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria<br />The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF's within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<br />The Heartland Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Heartland Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.</p>
<p>Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process<br />Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their "intent to participate" to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB by the Clinical Product Team (CPT), to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will qualify and be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. In general, "acceptability" for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of "technical acceptability." The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>1. Technical/Company Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below: Vendors must provide a complete line of Suction Catheters and Tips for single use. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: FRAZIER INSTRUMENT, 10 FRENCH, VITAL VUE*EXT YANK W/EXT 12FR METAL SUCT, BULB TIP YANKAUER WITHOUT CONT, SINGLE USE SUCTION PRODUCTS ST, CONT SUCT CATH 14FR, TRACH CARE CLOSED SUCTION, T P, PH HANDLE FOR YANK SUCTION CAN, ELBOW TRACHEOSTOMY 14 FR 30.5CM LENGTH W/ELBOW FOR TRACH TUBE, YANKAUER WITH 1/4 X 6' NON-CO, and STERI-CATH CLOSED VENTILATION. <br />2. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />3. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Suction Catheters and Tips product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ. Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified. <br />4. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current Prime Vendor for the Heartland Region, Owens &amp; Minor, for distribution in the Heartland Region. A vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified. <br />5. Vendors must provide their 4-Digit Prime Vendor Number in response to this RFQ. If unknown, contact Owens and Minor.<br />6. Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.<br />7. Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Suction Catheters, Cannulae, and Tips, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ. The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<br />8. Vendors are required to provide a full line of surgical suction cannulae and tips as well as non-surgical suction catheters. Please list the types and brands of cannulae, tips and catheters to include sterile cannula/tubing sets and single packaged sterile cannula (i.e. Yankauer, Frazier, Poole, uterine vacuum curette, nasogastric, or tracheal suction) in response to this RFQ.</p>
<p>Phase II-Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested.</p>
<p>Clinical Evaluation Process: For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.</p>
<p>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor's product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient-care setting using a Likert-like scale, with a one to five rating. The scale descriptors are: 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will establish the "actual" clinical acceptability threshold following the clinical evaluation/data analysis. The CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.00 in determining the actual acceptability threshold that will allow a reasonable source selection decision. Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable and disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<br />1. Patient Safety-Sterile packaging allows the product to be aseptically delivered to the sterile field.<br />a. Aseptic delivery of tubing is essential is adding extra tubing to the sterile field.<br />b. Criteria will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will delivery sterile tubing to Surgical Team and evaluate ease (sterility) of delivery.<br />2. Patient Safety- Suction tips/catheters have non-slip grip in dry, wet, and bloody environments.<br />a. Clinician must be able to hold onto tips/catheters even if gloves are wet.<br />b. Criteria will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will use tips/catheters with wet and/or bloody gloves and access if product slips from hand.<br />3. Clinician Safety-Suction tips/catheters have smooth suction holes, appropriately placed for type of instrument.<br />a. Holes must be smooth (free from sharp edges) and appropriately placed in order for clinician to have optimal exposure.<br />b. Criteria will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will use tips/catheters and evaluate exposure and insure holes are smooth.<br />4. Clinician Compliance/Patient Safety-Suction tips/catheters have features appropriate to their surgical function (i.e. malleable shafts, control vents, and tips are a-traumatic to patient, etc.).<br />a. Catheters/Tips must be malleable to go around corners and tips must not cause trauma to patient. <br />b. Criteria will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will use tips/catheters and see if shafts are malleable and tips are a-traumatic to patient.<br /><br />Price Analysis Process:</p>
<p>1. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Heartland Region. Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).<br />2. Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with the potential for three (3) one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<br />3. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<br />4. The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis: <br />a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) to include analysis to determine cost savings, if any, relative to historical spending.<br />b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time). <br />c. Impact of Unmatched Lines (i.e. do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?).<br />d. Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.</p>

Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.<br />7. Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Suction Containers, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ. The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<br />8.

Vendor will provide critical measurement canisters - clearly visible graduations from "0" to "3000" ccs. Please provide the information on the various graduation configurations, in response to this RFQ.</p>
<p><br />Phase II-Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested.</p>
<p>Clinical Evaluation Process: For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.</p>
<p>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor's product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient-care setting using a Likert-like scale, with a one to five rating. The scale descriptors are: 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days. The CPT has established a "target" threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will establish the "actual" clinical acceptability threshold following the clinical evaluation/data analysis. The CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.00 in determining the actual acceptability threshold that will allow a reasonable source selection decision. Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable and disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<br />1. Clinician Safety-The lids have 90-degree angled adapters and over-flow valves which function correctly. <br />a. 90 degree angles are needed so tubing will not kink or slip. Over-Flow valves are needed so as to reduce opportunity for contamination of persons and environment.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will attach tubing and observe for kinking or slip then will fill canister with fluid and insure over-flow valve works correctly. <br />2. Clinician Safety-The lids are applied to the container with ease and remain securely attached.<br />a. Lids should fit on easily to decrease time in assembling and remain attached so contents do not spill out to reduce opportunity for contamination of persons and environment.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will apply lid to container and check for tight, secure fit.<br />3. Clinician Compliance/Safety-The disposable liner "system" - (1) hard canister/holder, (1) liner and lid and ring assembly w/suction) fit correctly, easily assembled and function correctly.<br />a. System must assemble quickly and securely for clinician ease of use and function correctly as to reduce opportunity for contamination of persons and environment.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will assemble suction "system" and evaluate for ease and correct function.<br />4. Clinician Compliance/Safety-Serial Suction Systems: using disposable liners, the plastic holders, the lids and tandem tubing, "T" converter tubing and rings (any combination of these items used to create an effective and safe serial suction system) - the serial suction system assembled easily and functions correctly.<br />a. System must assemble quickly and securely for clinician ease of use and function correctly to reduce opportunity for contamination of persons and environment. Tandem usage is important for using more than one suction container at once.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will assemble suction "system" and evaluate for ease and correct function.<br />5. Clinician Safety-The suction reservoir (either disposable liner or hard plastic container) is easily filled with fluid solidifier.<br />a. Hole must be large enough for clinician to easily pour "solidifier" into container without difficulty.<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting<br />c. Clinician will pour solidifier into canister and evaluate for ease of use.<br />6. Clinician Compliance/Safety- Canister system assembles quickly (i.e. easy to separate from the stack, package opens by hand, lid snaps on reliably, ports are marked clearly).<br />a. System must assemble quickly and securely for clinician ease of use and function correctly to reduce opportunity for contamination of persons and environment. <br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting<br />c. Clinician will assemble suction "system" and evaluate for ease of use<br />7. Patient Safety-Canister has accurate volume gradations.<br />a. It is important for Anesthesia/Physicians to accurately and constantly evaluate fluid and blood loss (access through visualization)<br />b. This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Tested by instilling a known and independently-measured quantity of liquid into canister and checking accuracy of gradations.<br /><br />Price Analysis Process:</p>
<p>1. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Heartland Region. Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).<br />2. Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with the potential for three (3) one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<br />3. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<br />4. The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis: <br />a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) to include analysis to determine cost savings, if any, relative to historical spending.<br />b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time). <br />c. Impact of Unmatched Lines (i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?); and<br />d. Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.</p>

<DESC><p>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<br />---------------<br />A. General Information<br />The Heartland Region seeks approval to initiate the standardization process for Suction Tubing and Connectors for its 7 Army, Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and US Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF's) in the states of Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan in the Heartland Region including institutional and operational healthcare settings. Standardization action for this product line represents a new initiative. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFQ). Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed in 1a of the Technical Criteria below, will be disqualified in Phase I.
<p>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program. The seven facilities in the area include Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky, Naval Hospital Corps School Great Lakes Illinois, and USCG Air Station Traverse City Michigan.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Regions current PV Owens &amp; Minor. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their products. This RFQ will result in a Regional Incentive Agreements (RIA) that is a supplement to the PV Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's PV program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is November 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<br />Point of Contact: Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>B. Products and Performance Required<br />The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Suction Tubing and Connectors, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $15,011.33. This forecast is based on historical CDMIA sales for a 12-month period. The top-ten (10) high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below. At the request of the Heartland Regional MTF's vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075. All e-mail communication between vendors and the Region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Heartland Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria<br />The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF's within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.<br />The Heartland Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Heartland Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.</p>
<p>Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process<br />Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their "intent to participate" to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB by the Clinical Product Team (CPT), to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will qualify and be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. In general, "acceptability" for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of "technical acceptability." The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Criteria:</p>
<p>1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Suction Tubing and Connectors for single use. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: MEDC TUBING SUCTION 2 CONN 3/16X10, 3/16(4.8MM) X 6' (1.8M) TUBING, 3/16(4.8MM) X100'(30M) BUBBLE, FUNNEL/FUNNEL, 3/16 X 12', TUBING,NONCOND, 5MM X 6', FEMALE MOLDED CONNECTOR, 9/32, FRAZIER CONNECTING TUBE, 3/16, INTEGRAL BUBBLE, 3/16 X 100, FEMALE MOLDED CONNECTOR, 3/16, PH CONNECTOR CLEAN 5-IN-1, PH NONCOND TUBING 5MM 100 FT, PH CONNECTOR STER 6-IN-1 Y, PH CONNECTOR STER Y 3/8, PH CONNECTOR CLEAN INYIN 1/4IN, SUCTION CONN TUBE 3/16X20 S, CONNECTOR TUBING STR A18 TAPER, and MEDC TUBING SUCTION 2 CONN 3/16X10.<br />2. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />3. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Suction Tubing and Connectors product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.) <br />4. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current Prime Vendor for the Heartland Region, Owens &amp; Minor, for distribution in the Heartland Region. (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified). <br />5. Vendors must provide their 4-Digit Prime Vendor Number in response to this RFQ. If unknown, contact Owens and Minor.<br />6. Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.<br />7. Vendors MUST provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Suction Tubing and Connectors, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ. The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question. <br />8. Vendors are required to provide a full line of surgical suction tubing and connectors. Please list the types of tubing to include single packaged sterile tubing, and non-sterile bulk tubing and sizes &amp; types of connectors in response to this RFQ. Please note the vendor must be able to supply non-sterile suction tubing to the company that holds the Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) to assemble custom packs for the region. Currently, that vendor is AVID Medical.<br />Phase II-Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested.</p>
<p>Clinical Evaluation Process: For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.</p>
<p>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor's product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical/patient-care setting using a Likert-like scale, with a one to five rating. The scale descriptors are: 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The linical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will establish the "actual" clinical acceptability threshold following the clinical evaluation/data analysis. The CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the acceptability target threshold of 3.00 in determining the actual acceptability threshold that will allow a reasonable source selection decision. Vendors scoring below the actual acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically unacceptable and disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<br />1. Patient Safety-Sterile packaging allows the product to be aseptically delivered to the sterile field<br />a. Aseptic delivery of tubing is essential is adding extra tubing to the sterile field.<br />b. Criteria will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will delivery sterile tubing to Surgical Team and evaluate ease (sterility) of delivery.<br />2. Patient Safety-Product packaging easily identifies whether the item contains latex.<br />a. It is imperative that clinician knows if product contains Latex prior to delivering it to the sterile field.<br />b. Criteria will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will observe package, prior to delivery to the sterile field, to access if "Latex-free" is clearly visible.<br />3. Clinician Safety-Connection between cannula, tubing, and suction container is secure. <br />a. A secure connection is essential so as to reduce the opportunity for contamination of persons and environment.<br />b. Criteria will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will assemble tubing, containers, and cannulae and assess for any leakage of fluid.<br />4. Patient Safety-Tubing has low coil memory and drapes well.<br />a. Tubing stays uncoiled and in place when after un-coiling to insure tubing does not become contaminated by falling below the sterile field.<br />b. Criteria will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. Clinician will uncoil tubing and assess if it remains uncoiled and drapes well.<br />5. Patient Safety-Tubing withstands a high vacuum pressure without collapsing.<br />a. If tubing collapses the surgeon is unable to view the sterile field due to the filling with fluid.<br />b. Criteria will be evaluated in a clinical/patient-care setting.<br />c. While using the tubing, clinician will observe for any collapsing.<br /><br />Price Analysis Process:</p>
<p>1. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Heartland Region. Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).<br />2. Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with the potential for three (3) one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<br />3. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<br />4. The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis: <br />a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) to include analysis to determine cost savings, if any, relative to historical spending.<br />b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time). <br />c. Impact of Unmatched Lines (i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?); and<br />d. Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.</p>

<a href="mailto:milton.washington@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>Brief Summary: The US Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Acquisition Center in Orlando, FL is developing an acquisition strategy to award a 5-year (1 year base with 4 one year options) Constructive Training Systems (CTS) single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The resulting contract will be Firm Fixed Price with Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Time & Mateiral provisions. This effort will enable the Project Manager (PM) Constructive Simulation (ConSim) to execute its mission of acquiring, fielding and sustaining the constructive simulations used to support the Army's command and staff training requirements. The CTS contractor will provide constructive training systems as well as technical, management and professional engineering support services, for the Common Battle Command Simulation Equipment (CBCSE), Battle Command Training Capability-Equipment Support (BCTC-ES) and Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC) programs, which form the base of the CTS effort.<BR><BR>Background: JLCCTC is a software modeling and simulation capability that contributes to the joint training functional concept and the Army training mission area by providing the appropriate levels of model and simulation resolution and fidelity needed to support both Army and Joint training requirements. JLCCTC is comprised of two separate federations, Multi Resolution Federation (MRF) and Entity Resolution Federation (ERF). JLCCTC-MRF is a federated set of constructive simulation software supported by commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware (HW) and software (SW) products. JLCCTC-MRF supports the training of commanders and their staffs in maneuver, logistics, intelligence, air defense and artillery. The federate models are connected by a combination of the standard High-Level Architecture (HLA), Run-Time Infrastructure (RTI), Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), custom interfaces, the corps battle staff Master Interface (MI) and Point-to- Point (PTP). The JLCCTC-MRF is a Command Post Exercise (CPX) driver designed to train Army commanders and their staffs at division through echelons above corps. JLCCTC-MRF provides the simulated operational environment in which computer generated forces stimulate and respond to the command and control processes of the commanders and staffs. The JLCCTC-MRF models will provide full training functionality for leader and battle staff for the Army and the Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental and Multinational (JIIM) spectrum. JLCCTC-MRF provides an interface to Battle Command (BC) equipment allowing commanders and their staffs to train with their go to war systems. JLCCTC-ERF is a federation of constructive simulations, BC interfaces, data collection and After Action Review (AAR) tools. It stimulates the BC systems to facilitate battle staff collective training by requiring staff reaction to incoming digital information while executing the commanders tactical plan. The targeted training audience is comprised of brigade and battalion battle staffs, functional Command Post (CP) training, and full CP training. The JLCCTC new equipment training (NET) and fielding will be conducted utilizing a Hub and Spoke concept. There are 13 Hubs and the number of spokes varies from 0-4 for each Hub. NET will be conducted at the Hub during a 3-week period. Spokes will send their key personnel to the Hub to receive the NET.<BR><BR>CBCSE is a fundamental element of JLCCTC. CBCSE procures the COTS HW & SW products and network devices in support of the JLCCTC program and provides infrastructure upgrades as required for US Army Battle Command Training Centers worldwide. CBCSE procures common hardware platforms (CHP) capable of running each version of fielded JLCCTC software in support of Army constructive simulation programs to stimulate the Armys Command and Control (C2) communication systems to meet command and staff training requirements. Viability is ensured through a Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) process in conjunction with the JLCCTC simulation SW VV&A. CBCSE SW includes COTS operating systems, databases and desk top software. CBCSE has supported additional customer requirements in the past with the procurement of COTS HW and SW to support the establishment of two Battle Command Training Distributed Systems, the Defense Acquisition Universitys Simulation and Training Conference Facility located at Ft Belvoir, VA and US Marine Corps PM Training Systems Combined Arms Command and Control Training Upgrade Systems project.<BR><BR>BCTC-ES provides network equipment and technical tools that enhance the integration of constructive simulations to Army C2 systems, extend units communications capabilities, integrates C2 white boxes into Tactical Operation Center (TOC) sets, provides visualization of the common operating picture (COP) and ensures simulation-C2 thread functionality. BCTC-ES is the enabling link within a BCTC that supports JLCCTC/C2 stimulation. BCTC-ES components may be provided individually, in conjunction with a JLCCTC-ERF fielding, or as part of a new Military Construction, Army (MCA) BCTC. BCTC-ES provides significant battle command capability enhancement to include: networks internal to the BCTC Wide Area Network (WAN); Local Area Network (LAN) additions of and distribution to external TOC pads; training classrooms; Local Training Areas & remote sites; Radio-Wire Integration Systems to link constructive player work cells with a unit TOC across combat radio nets; Packet Radio Units both fixed and mobile to transmit virtual Unmanned Aerial Vehicle data/video between BCTC and a remote TOC; C2 Servers to link C2 white boxes into unit and HICON / EXCON TOC sets; and battle sight visualization tool to provide video feeds of simulations and/or C2 systems. In addition to the BCTC-ES requirements noted above, the new BCTC MCA projects will require the procurement of COTS HW, SW, furniture and infrastructure elements required to support the conducting of Battle Command Training. <BR><BR>This effort will require temporary duty worldwide to conduct JLCCTC new equipment training (NET) and fielding, field and NET for BCTC-ES components, support BCTC MCA projects and perform infrastructure upgrades. Security clearances up to and including Top Secret will be required to perform work under this contract. <BR><BR>This announcement does not constitute a request for proposal at this time. <BR><BR>There are draft documents attached that are intended to provide general CTS scope information. The draft documents are correct and accurate at this point for the purpose intended. The Government intends to utilize a single award IDIQ contract instrument to meet the CTS requirement under full & open competition. It is the Governments intent to post a Request for Proposal (RFP) within the next 30 days. In the coming weeks we will continue to post draft documents as information becomes available. All potential offerors are encouraged to continually monitor this site for updates. No responses are required. This notice provides presolicitation information only.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), Hardware/Software Branch, Software Section, (DITCO/PL8321), 2300 East Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5406, intends to issue a sole source contract to Radiant Logic Inc., 1682 Novato Blvd., Novato, CA 94947-7001. <br />This acquisition is for the procurement of RadiantOne VDS Enterprise annual software maintenance and 24 days support for the Virtual Directory Server (VDS) to Enterprise License for the Joint Enterprise Directory Service (JEDS) program located in Arlington, VA. JEDS is a DOD wide system used for coordinating efforts to develop a comprehensive DOD white pages service. RadiantOne software maintenance source availability is limited from Radiant Logic. This order of the Synchronization Services provides back-end granular updates for metadirectory functionality, and use remote connectors (agent-less connection) for non-intrusive access, or local connectors for real time notifications. Synchronization Services also include unified identity features to map common identities in heterogeneous data sources. RadiantOne is a flexible and comprehensive identity infrastructure designed to integrate identities and match them to application requirements. By virtualizing the directory service, identity infrastructure doesn't have to be one-size-fits all. A virtual directory tree structure (its view) can be customized to meet new requirements, or new views can be added without disrupting integration based on other views. This action is required to purchase Radiant Professional Services - 24 days of professional services provided by a trained Radiant Logic System Engineer that can be used any time between 6/1/2009 and 5/31/2010. This can be on-site or remote and includes architecture, customization, tuning and coding services. Delivery dates will be mutually agreed upon between Radiant and IA42.
<p>Product Name/Description:</p>
<p>- RadiantOne Virtual Directory Server (VDS) Enterprise, 6/1/2009 through 5/31/2010 (Enterprise License for JEDS &amp; support 24X7)<br />- Radiant Professional Services, 6/1/2009 through 5/31/2010 (RadiantOne Professional Services, 24 days)</p>
<p>Radiant Logic, Inc. has proprietary rights to the software code for the RadiantOne VDS Enterprise software products associated with this requirement and is the only known source that can provide this maintenance support. No other vendor or distributor can legally obtain access to the software and no other vendor can make duplicate copies since it is protected by copyright and patent laws. The Period of Performance is 6/1/2009 through 5/31/2010. No reinstatement fees will be authorized.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Companies who can provide the above listed software license, enhancement renewal, and 24 days of professional services must request a copy of the RFP not later than 24 July 2009 via the following address: steven.scharlow@disa.mil. You may fax written correspondence to facsimile (618) 229-9177. Oral requests are not acceptable. The estimated award date is 31 July 2009. The resultant contract will be firm fixed price. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered. The NAICS code is 541511 for this procurement.</p>

<SOLNBR>GS00TO8AJC0009
<RESPDATE>072409
<CONTACT>Chiara A. McDowell, Contracting Officer, Email chiara.mcdowell@gsa.gov - Brendan J. McDonough, Email brendan.mcdonough@gsa.gov
<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Federal System Integration Management (FEDSIM) intent to extend the period of performance under contract GS00T08AJC0009, with Darlington, Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of ITT Corporation, 2325 Charleston Regional Parkway, Charleston, SC 29492 utilizing the procedures of FAR Part 12. 

This action is required to extend day-to-day operational capacity as well as a 24/7 response capacity services for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) due to a receipt of protest against the follow-on competitive award (GST0009AJ0015). As a result of the protest, a stay of performance is in place on the current award until GAO resolves the protest.

The day to day IT and Communications support is critical because it is a cornerstone and an enabling facet of OFDAs ability to respond immediately and robustly to disasters around the world, thus allowing USAID to successfully represent the U.S. Government during times of need. Disaster assistance, as provided through USAID/OFDA, is a key component of the U.S. foreign policy agenda.   Any gaps in the provision of this ICT support would effectively shut down USAID/OFDAs ability to perform both disaster responses and to conduct its on-going operations, thus creating ripple effects around the world.  OFDAs Information and Communications Technology (ICT) support is the essential foundation through which USAID/OFDA is able to respond on behalf of the U.S. Government, not only for disasters but for the continuation of daily operations such as programming funds to on-going disaster situations around the world. It is also the structure through which all communications occur both in and between Washington and OFDAs worldwide staff and counterparts. This includes the following mission critical components: twenty-four hour, seven day a week (24/7) network and user support; field communications equipment and technical officer support (deployed during a disaster response); all end user application deployment, development and maintenance; coordination and compliance with all USAID IT and security policies; and all necessary warehousing, lifecycle management and logistics support for OFDAs IT and communications equipment used for disaster response

Due to the protest and the on-going disaster responses, the government requires the continued involvement of the current contractor and its staff for the anticipated recurring need for these day to day and disaster response services.  The existing contract expires July 31, 2009 and it is the governments intent to modify the existing contract to extend the period of performance, using one-month options, from July 31, 2009 through November 31, 2009.  The extension will be performed under the same terms and conditions as the existing contract.  The modification will be executed consistent with the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(2) and implemented by FAR 6.302-2, unusual and compelling urgency. Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements would result in serious injury (including financial), if this contract action is not executed by July 31, 2009.  The actions proposed within this announcement are justified. The government will support the proposed actions by written justification and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.

Interested persons may identify their challenge to this sole source modification response by submitting capability statements that demonstrates the contractors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the government. The statement shall include business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement.  Contractors must have a current registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov . 

This notice of intent/synopsis is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available and telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  Written challenges may be directed to Chiara McDowell via email at chiara.mcdowell@gsa.gov. If no responsive challenges are received by July 24, 2009 the contract modification will be executed with Darlington, Inc. without further notice.

<ARCHDATE>08202010
<CONTACT>Arthur Becker, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-09-10@ugov.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS
The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers Day Conference for the Knowledge Discovery and Dissemination (KDD) Program on August 20, 2009 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30am to 6:00pm in the Washington DC metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the Knowledge Discovery and Dissemination Program, to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.

This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS
The objective of the Knowledge Discovery and Dissemination (KDD) Program is to enable Intelligence Community (IC) analysts to quickly produce actionable intelligence from multiple sources of information including newly available data sets that are unfamiliar to the analyst.  
KDD has two main research thrusts: (1) Alignment of data models and (2) Advanced analytic algorithms that process data across multiple data sets.

(1) Alignment of Data Models: Associated with every data set is a data model. The data model describes the way the data is organized, terms that are extracted and labeled, and sometimes a formal ontology. For the analyst to effectively use the data set, the data model associated with the data set must be aligned or mapped to the analysts data model. Currently, alignment is achieved through a manually intensive process that prevents analysts from quickly using data that becomes available to them. The KDD program is interested in research that will automate the alignment of data models to allow data sets to be used quickly and effectively.

(2) Advanced Analytic algorithms: Advanced analytic algorithms infer information from the analyst data model to perform analytic tasks. These tasks include but are not limited to: topic spotting, semantic clustering, social network analysis and geo-spatial processing. There are known algorithms that perform such tasks over a single corpus of data. These techniques breakdown when applied across very different types of data. The KDD research program is interested in research that will extend advanced analytic algorithms to apply across multiple and different types of data sets.

The KDD program will measure research against realistic IC problems on real data in a statistically rigorous fashion. Each performer will be required to deliver their research as a working prototype in a Government specified framework that will be tested against realistic problems to measure the speed and accuracy of their process to align data models and the accuracy of their advanced analytic algorithms. 

KDD is anticipated to be a four year program.

The KDD Program will consist of both unclassified and classified research activities and expects to draw upon the research strengths of academia and industry through teaming. Successful proposers will combine cutting edge research with the ability to develop robust prototypes. Consequently, a significant portion of the KDD Proposers Day conference is dedicated to providing the opportunity to develop teaming arrangements.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION
Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST August 14, 2009 at http://conference.brtrc.com/KDD_pd/registration. Directions to the conference facility and other materials are available on the website.
Due to space limitations, attendance is limited to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government issued photo identification (e.g. drivers license or passport) to enter the conference.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The afternoon will include Presentation & Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present capabilities and explore teaming arrangements. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after approval to register for the Conference has been granted. Opportunities to present will be limited by time and will therefore be limited to the first 15 registered University respondents with approved presentations, and the first 15 corporate respondents with approved presentations. Poster areas will be provided to the first 60 registered respondents with approved posters. Presentations to the Government to solicit feedback are not intended, and KDD government personnel will not be present during these sessions. 

This Proposers Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete. 

IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference. 
Electronic devices with the ability to record are prohibited at this event.

Questions concerning conference & registration can be sent to IARPAevents@brtrc.com. 

Questions regarding the program can be sent to dni-iarpa-baa-09-10@ugov.gov.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI): Tools for Recognizing Unconscious Signals of Trustworthiness (TRUST)
<SOLNBR>IARPA-RFI-09-03
<RESPDATE>082109
<ARCHDATE>08202010
<CONTACT>Adam H. Russell, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-09-03@ugov.gov
<DESC>Synopsis
The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) often selects its research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation process. This Request For Information (RFI) is intended to provide basic information relevant to a possible future IARPA program, so that feedback from potential offerors may be considered prior to the issuance of a BAA. Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this RFI to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below.   Additionally, responses to this request may be used to i) inform a one and one-half day workshop (explained below), and/or ii) support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA Program BAA.  Therefore, responses must be available for unrestricted public distribution and hence proprietary material that responders would not want disseminated should not be included in responses. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.

Background & Scope
The need to trust is everywhere, yet trust is often misplaced, misunderstood, or betrayed. As some of the most complex tiers of human social behavior, different kinds of trust play important roles in most human interactions, whether it is trust between two people, trust among people in a group or across groups, trust in machines and human-machine interfaces, or trust in national or global systems like exchange markets, the Internet, and international law.  Indeed, as measured by self-report, levels of generalized trust among people and nations are considered a key predictor of social, financial, technological, and even personal wellbeing.  

This makes the understanding of whom or what can be trusted paramount. However, while the importance of trust in many conditions is increasingly well understood, current models of different kinds of trust  and ways that people assess trustworthiness - are incomplete, often failing to take into account new research on trust that is independently emerging from the social, behavioral, psychological, economic, and neurosciences.  For example, some recent research indicates that assessing another person as trustworthy, while often thought of as a conscious choice, in fact occurs as a result of largely preconscious processes.  Yet the neurobiological bases  of different kinds of trust, and what preconscious signals humans use to assess and maintain such trust, are still poorly understood.

Consequently, current approaches to understanding how and why people assess others as being trustworthy are often limited by nave definitions of trust or trustworthiness, an over-reliance on deception detection-based paradigms in which trust is thought of as merely the absence of deception, overly-simplistic and unrealistic protocols, poorly-validated or unreliable signals of trust, lack of appropriate sensor and neurophysiological signal processing, and theoretical and functional shortcomings in terms of understanding which  and to what degree  one or more human neurobiological systems support specific kinds of trust.   
IARPA is soliciting submissions on the following areas aimed at addressing the challenges of defining, understanding, and ultimately detecting valid, reliable signatures of trust in humans:
     1.)  Different kinds of trust and what, if any, kinds of neurophysiological signals might be associated with them.  IARPA seeks to understand the different manifestations that trust may take (i.e. swift trust, conditional trust, unconditional trust, etc.) as well as the different neurophysiological processes associated with one or more of these kinds of trust.  
     2.)  New models of neural systems and patterns of neural activation related to different kinds of trust and associated neurophysiological signatures of those activation patterns. IARPA seeks to understand the degree to which the neural-bases of trust(s) may assist in detecting peripheral signals of trust and trustworthiness under different conditions.
     3.)  Potentially novel preconscious signals or combinations of signals  neural, endocrine, physiological, behavioral, etc.  that may be indicative of trust or trustworthiness among people in different contexts.  IARPA seeks to elucidate signals and neurobiological processes that humans may use for assessing trust, but which are not yet  or are currently poorly - understood.  
     4.)  New sensor technologies or combinations of technologies that can assist in detecting subtle but valid and reliable changes in neurophysiological states that may be indicative of trust among humans.  IARPA seeks to explore the feasibility of using technology to amplify systems that humans have evolved to preconsciously assess trust in others.
     5.)  Novel, ecologically-valid, but ethical trust-based protocols designed to assess the validity and reliability of potential trust signals among two or more humans.  IARPA seeks to develop new, more sophisticated processes for understanding near real-time human preconscious assessment  of trust in near real-world circumstances. 

Respondents may submit responses to one or more areas of interest. If submitting to more than one area, however, respondents should i) prepare separate submissions for each area, and ii) clearly indicate which area the submission addresses at the beginning of each submission. Each submission must adhere to the formatting guidelines described below, including page limitations.

The responses to this RFI will be used to help in the planning of a one and a half day workshop on techniques for recognizing unconscious or preconscious signatures of trust and trustworthiness among humans.  The results of this workshop may justify a multi-year competitive program. The selection of topics, participants, and setting of the agenda of this workshop will in part be informed by the responses, with responders being potentially invited to participate and present at this workshop. It is anticipated that this workshop will be held in September 2009.

Preparation Instructions to Respondents
IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and estimated cost of the proposed approach. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed. 

IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the US. Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged. Responses have the following formatting requirements: 

     1. A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with IARPA-RFI-09-03 

     2. A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary; 

     3. A description (limited to 5 pages in minimum 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins) of the technical challenges and suggested approach(es);

     4. A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached);

     5. Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas.

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.</span></strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RECOVERY - Managerial and Oversight Support for the EPA Clean Water State Revolving Fund</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Modification 44 is to obligate $640,000 in support of four work assignments (WA 3-100; WA 3-101; WA 3-102 and WA 3-103). The period of performance for all these work assignments is from April 13, 2009 through March 31, 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of WA 3-100 is to develop tools to assist the EPA's Office of Wastewater Management's State Revolving Fund Branch to properly manage and provide oversight for funds provide to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) under the ARRA. The tools to be developed under this work assignment include a checklist to be used by EPA Regional SRF staff to review and monitor ARRA funds provided to CWSRF borrowers to ensure that the funds are being used properly and effectively. The contractor shall also develop guidelines for State SRF programs to monitor and oversee how the federal ARRA funds are being used and to ensure that all federal and State requirements are being followed. The current value of WA 3-100 is $218,499 with additional funds to be required for Amendment 1 to the work assignment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of WA 3-101 is to support EPA in ensuring that States and EPA Regions understand data entry issues associated with ARRA reporting in the existing CWSRF Benefits Reporting (CBR) database. This will include supporting EPA's efforts to facilitate reporting transparency, and to develop, update, and expand a portfolio of reports on the environmental and economic impact of CWSRF loans made with ARRA funds. The current value of WA 3-101 is $63,454.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of WA 3-102 is to provide support to EPA in developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy for the Green Project Reserve provisions of the ARRA. Key tasks include providing logistical support for EPA in responding to inquiries regarding new ARRA Green Project Reserve implementation, outreach and training, assistance to States soliciting Green Project Reserve applications, oversight and tracking and reporting. The current value of WA 3-102 is $299,972.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose WA 3-103 is to support the development of tools and training aligned with the unique aspects of the ARRA for Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) State programs and the borrower community of the DWSRF. This support will include: (a) participating in and providing support to a full day working session with the DWSRF program to support the development of a program oversight strategy for the unique needs of the ARRA funds. The contractor shall provide its expertise in program management, financial management, auditing and risks, and data management; (b) developing a means to transfer data from the DWSRF's Project Management System to the Office of Management &amp; Budget's (OMB) Recovery.gov website; and (c) supporting two (2) web seminars on the DWSRF and ARRA. This support for the webinars shall consist of getting a web seminar service, managing registration, and recording questions and answers during the web seminars. The current value of WA 3-103 is $84,517.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

OFFICE OF INTERACTIVE DISCLOSURE
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 
DATA MANAGEMENT TOOLS

INTRODUCTION

The Office of Interactive Disclosure (OID) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking information on data management tools that will assist SEC staff in their use of XBRL files.  The SEC has mandated that registrants filing with the SEC must file portions of selected forms in XBRL format.  OID is seeking information about software applications and tools available now or in the near future to help the Commission staff access, render, manipulate, and aggregate these filings.

BACKGROUND

The SEC recently mandated that operating companies file financial statements using eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL), a variant of XML, beginning in June 2009 and phased in over 3 years.  Prior to this, the SEC trialed an XBRL filing process for several years through the Voluntary Filer Program (VFP).  During the VFP some operating companies filed financial information in XBRL format with the SEC. Based on this experience, the SEC established OID in 2007 to design, implement, and maintain this process on a formal basis, resulting in the above-discussed mandatory rules.  

The purpose of the disclosure program is to improve transparency in financial disclosures for market participants and regulators.  Filings received in standardized, machine-readable format will make it possible to automate many manual processes thereby improving users abilities to validate, analyze, aggregate, and utilize filings.

The SEC is considering ways to provide its staff with applications and tools to use and examine the structured data filings. The Commission seeks information on existing or planned software systems that will help its staff use these structured data files.   

SCOPE OF REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

OID seeks information regarding software solutions available now or in the near future that enables end users with low degrees of technical expertise to perform some or all of the functions listed below:

 Access files containing XBRL data from a file server and/or a local drive;
 Prepare the data for analysis:
  o Extract data from the file(s);
  oTransform the data if necessary into the desired format or structure; and
  oLoad the data into a database for storage and further processing.
 Define and apply business rules and criteria to test for specific conditions, search for terms, perform analysis, and generate reports.  End users should be able to create and implement these criteria without relying on programmers;
 Provide APIs, plug-ins, and other means for commercial off the shelf software to access and utilize the data (such as, but not limited to Excel, SAS, Business Objects, etc.);
 Analyze, compare, and report on text data that may be tagged at the block or detail levels;
 Export, convert, and save data in a variety of standard file formats;
 Maintain user-level data security and confidentiality through role-based access controls.

Please describe/explain your software solution as requested under SUBMISSION.
In addition to the functionality listed above please provide information about:

o The challenges associated with company-specific XBRL extensions and ways your proposed solution addresses them.
o Ability to integrate with third party products.
o The built-in analytical and reporting capabilities, both pre-defined and user defined:
o For user defined analyses and reports describe the process for building them and the level of technical expertise required.
o Ability to add non-XBRL data into analyses and reports.
o Technology requirements for your proposed software.  This may include information about the platforms, networking capabilities, databases, implementation processes, configuration options, and hardware requirements.  
o Available end user and technical training and support services.
o Licensing methods and indicative pricing for 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 users.  Include any ongoing maintenance fees.
o The extent to which some/all of the functionality described above can be automated.  Include information about available or compatible scripting and administration frameworks and tools. 
o Capabilities to alert and notify staff when triggered by specific events (e.g. file received in a folder, ratio exceeded, threshold crossed) via email or text message.

The SEC welcomes responses about products that partially fulfill the functionality described above and/or that are in pre-release stages (indicate the planned release date).

This RFI reflects the minimum functionality we seek.  Respondents are encouraged to provide information on alternative and innovative solutions, functions, and designs, particularly if respondent thinks it would produce superior results. 

SUBMISSION

RFI respondents must respond in the form of a Capability Statement that addresses: 1) the products ability to fulfill the above functionality, 2) your companys profile and experience in providing these types of solutions, if any, and 3) any other relevant information that would enhance the SECs understanding of the information submitted.  Please indicate in your response which capabilities can be provided via commercial off the shelf software versus custom developed solutions.  

Please note that this Request for Information is in no way related to the RFP for XBRL compliance tools.

Email the requested information to:  carruthm@sec.gov.

DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the SEC to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.

<a href="mailto:charlene.duncan@va.gov">VA260-C-0648 Station Electrical J&A</a>
<DESC>Justification and Approval For Other Than Full and Open Competition:  1.  Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, VAMC, Walla Walla (Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial Medical Center).  2.  Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of design-build construction services from O'Neill Electric, Inc. (O'Neill) a veteran-owned small business (VOSB).  3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  The Contractor will be required to design and construct the necessary upgrades to the station electrical utility service to support a minimum of 2 new medical facilities and realignment of the remaining facilities to accommodate leasing out buildings not needed by the VAMC, Walla Walla.  4.  Statutory Authority:  This justification is in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5) Authorized or Required by Statute.  5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  O'Neill is a VOSB and is listed on the VA's www.vetbiz.gov website.  Authority to sole source acquisitions up to $5,000,000 to VOSB firms is granted by 38 U.S.C. 8127(c).  The estimated cost of this acquisition is $1,810,500, well under the $5,000,000 threshold.  6.  Actions to Promote Competition:  Not applicable to this acquisition.  7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $1,810,500.  This estimate was developed by an architect-engineer firm contracted to perform a study of the current situation and to provide a SOW, the specifications and an estimate of costs to upgrade the service.  8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  In accordance with 38 U.S.C.  8127(c) and IL 049-07-08 Veterans First Program, this action will be sole sourced to O'Neill.  O'Neill is a VOSB and is listed on the VA's www.vetbiz.gov website.  A search of this website for all firms in Idaho, Oregon and Washington showing a NAICS Code of 237130 found eleven (11) firms; however, only four (4) firms (Columbia West, Inc.; O'Neill Electric, Inc.; J.B. Federal Energy Systems, LLC; and Pacific Federal Energy Systems, LLC) provide any indication that they are capable of performing design-build work in the area of electrical utility service.  Of these four (4) firms, two (2) are SDVOSBs and two (2) are VOSB.  Please see attached spreadsheet.  Columbia West, Inc. (VOSB) indicates that NAICS 237130 is a primary code; however, no bonding capacity is provided nor is a capability narrative provided;  O'Neill Electric, Inc. (VOSB) includes NAICS 237130, has sufficient bonding capacity of $5,000,000, and their capability narrative clearly provides and indication of their ability to support tenant improvement projects (enhanced use lease) and electrical distribution systems;  J.B. Federal Energy Systems, LLC (SDVOSB) provides no indication of bonding capacity and no capability narrative is provided;  Pacific Federal Energy Systems, LLC (SDVOSB) includes NAICS 237130 provides a bonding capacity of only $1,000,000, which is less than the estimated amount of the project.  In discussion with local Facility Support personnel and with VA personnel located in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, the firm receiving the highest recommendation was O'Neill Electric, Inc.  As such, O'Neill has been selected as the contractor for this effort.  9.  Other Considerations:  Not applicable to this acquisition.  10.  List of Sources:  See attached.  11.  Statement of Actions to Remove Barriers to Competition:  Not applicable to this acquisition.  All appropriate and required approval signatures were obtained.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the <br />Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any<br />other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

The contractor may submit, on a yearly basis, a request for equitable adjustment for taxes, fees, and surcharges to include supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA (New Requirement). <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/.

YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUTE DAILY TO THE PERSONNEL SECURITY BRANCH OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, DC

Description

OPM has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on prospective ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.  The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.  ATF will provide these regulations to the Contractor.

ATF realizes there is a need to secure the services of persons possessing certain degrees of expertise in the processing of background investigations, including planning, scoping, assigning and reviewing.  To that end, ATF has a need for In-House Special Investigators, hereinafter referred to as contractors.  ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

Contract investigators who are under contract with ATF shall be known as Special Investigators and carry credentials authorizing them to perform such background investigations as the Assistant Director may authorize.  Contractors may also be assigned to assist with other official ATF investigations.

Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them.  Such tasks might include planning assignments, scoping investigations, assigning investigations, reviewing Reports of Investigation (ROI), auditing and adjudicating investigations, completing invoices for payment for the investigation and working on special projects as directed by the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) and/or Branch Chief.  Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  
Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Contractors will be paid at the rate of $56.00 per hour. Hours authorized and worked in excess of 40 hours per week will be paid at the rate of $84.00; the need for additional work hours must be agreed upon and have prior approval from the COTR and/or Branch Chief.  

Standard In House Contractors:
Contractors shall ensure their availability to process needed work in a timely manner.  A minimum of 32 hours per week is required.  Contractors are responsible for providing adequate office coverage with their respective team; to include holiday and high vacation/travel months.  Failure to meet necessary availability may result in termination of the contract.   

On-Call In House Contractors:
The ATF may have a need to hire on-call contractors.  If investigative work and/or an increase in priority investigations create a backlog, contractors would be required to work on an as needed basis; two or three days a week, as determined by the ATF.  On-call contractors will be contacted by the ATF when their services are required.  Once the necessary work has been performed, contractors will be excused from their assignment as directed by the ATF.  On-call contractors must adhere to the same standards and codes of conduct as Standard In House Contractors.  

In compliance with ATFs specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractors invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work. 

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  

Contractors are responsible for safeguarding information.  Background investigation information is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 and, unless classified, is considered Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) (also or formerly known as Sensitive but Unclassified information). CUI must not be transmitted via unsecured email or Internet, or disclosed to unauthorized parties.  Contractors must never furnish or divulge CUI contained in an investigation.  Each contractor must make every reasonable effort to protect data associated with a background investigation.  Data, notes, copies of testimonies, copies of ROIs, etc., are the sole property of ATF and must be safeguarded against unlawful disclosure.  

Each contractor shall execute a MOU, attesting to his or her understanding of this section, which, upon execution, will become a permanent part of this contract.  Contractors will have access to ATFs computer network and are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.  Contractors must also complete the following forms: ATF P 7500.1 (Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users), ATF F 2030.1 (Personnel Authenticator Locator), ATF F 1710.5 (Request for Media ID), and Social Engineering Certification.  

Identification media, ATF-provided software, and all other Government property must be surrendered when requested by the PSB. 

Each contractor must be able to obtain and maintain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and receive a Top Secret clearance.  This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the PSB, and be performed under such standards as the PSB may establish.  A favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF information, information technology systems, and unescorted access to facilities.  Failure to have a background investigation favorably adjudicated SSBI or receive a Top Secret clearance constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. The contractor is responsible for making changes to his/her own information.  Any changes to the contractors name, address, telephone number, company name, tax identification number, or financial institution information must be made by the contractor in the CCR.  The CCR is used to process electronic payment deposits.  It is vital contractors keep their registration current.  In addition, contractors must notify the PSB and the ATF Financial Management Division of any changes so the proper updates can be made to all systems.  

Each contractor, when working in the PSB, must carry themselves in a manner that reflects positively on ATF.  To that end, contractors, when on duty, should present themselves in a professional manner, be neatly groomed, and appropriately attired.  Complaints of inappropriate conduct or performance will be investigated, and if substantiated, may result in the contract being terminated.

Contractors must exhibit professional qualities during all periods of performance and absolute integrity is required and expected.  Contractors must be polite and professional in both conduct and appearance.

Contractors should never use ATF credentials for investigating any matter not assigned to them by ATF, PSB or for any personal gain.  Contractors must not allow their credentials to be photocopied or taken from their possession.  Lost or stolen credentials should be reported to the PSB immediately, as well as the local police department.

ATF intends to issue vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  The solicitation will close August 3, 2009 at 4 p.m. EST.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors.  A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably.  Because ATFs needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation add new contractors to the pool.  

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminate the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The BPA and the contractors responsibilities thereunder are subject changes in Federal law, regulation and policy, which may include, but are not limited to, procedural changes related to the use of government equipment, security procedures and investigative priorities.  Modifications may be sent to vendors via mail or electronic mail.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.

The following clauses are incorporated in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror  Commercial Items (Oct. 00)  and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference)  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items;  A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications- can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far. The Contractor may request a copy from SIAdministration@atf.gov.  Offeror shall provide a statement proving they have read and understand the term and Conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendors acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as passed will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 68 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores.  At least 56 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance and 12 must come from Vendor Capabilities.

A. Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance (80 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendors experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendors communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendors customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendors performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases.  Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.
(56 points minimum).

B. Capabilities (20 Points):  Capabilities are the vendors ability to adhere to agency and program requirements. (12 points minimum).

C. Acceptability: ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a pass or fail basis.  A vendors offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendors assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

Therefore we will not use those procedures. The Government will not establish a competitive range; conduct "discussions" with all offerors within a competitive range, or request final proposal revisions ("best and final offers") from offerors.  Instead, we will use the following procedures: (1) the FSS ordering procedures in FAR Section 8.404 (2) FAR Section 8.405 GSA's basic schedule ordering guidelines, (3) FAR Section 8.405-2 GSA's special ordering procedures for services requiring a statement of work, and for the procedures described below.  After receiving quotations, the Government may request additional oral or written information from one or more offerors, but not necessarily from all offerors.

Basis for Award:  

a.  The Government will make an award resulting from the Request for Quote (RFQ) to the responsible offeror(s) whose quote(s), conforming to the Statement of Work (SOW), will provide the Best Value to the Government, technical, price and other factors considered.  The Government may select for award the offeror whose total ceiling price is not necessarily the lowest, but whose overall proposal is deemed sufficiently more advantageous to the Government so as to justify the payment of a higher ceiling price.  Conversely, the Government may select for award the offeror whose total ceiling price is the lowest, when other proposals are not sufficiently more advantageous so as to justify the payment of a higher ceiling price.

b.	The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a delivery order without communications with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to make clarifications or request revised quotes if later determined by the Contacting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in the submitted quotes.

C. Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria:
The Government considers Technical Approach to represent the strongest indication of successful achievement of contractual objectives; technical approach is more important than Past Performance and Price. When combined Technical Approach and Past Performance is more important than price.

Past Performance Questionnaire:

Each Offeror is required to send a Past Performance Questionnaire (see attachment ) to at a minimum the three (3) past performance references list in their quote under past performance history references.  Using the past performance Rating Scale (see attachment) the Listed Past Performance reference information shall include at a minimum: company name, point of contact, phone/fax/e-mail information.  All Offeror references must complete the survey and email the survey to the contract specialist Ebrima Conteh at ebrima.conteh@dhs.gov no later than 1:00 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST), August 03, 2009.

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">(2) Prior to forwarding the forms, the Contractor is responsible for reviewing the forms for completeness.

Defense Distribution Center Hill AB UT (DDHU) has a requirement for maintenance of Micro Focus Software as described below.

This acquisition is unrestricted. The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 541519 and the small business average annual gross revenue is $25,000,000. The requirement consists of the following:

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION
This is in accordance with FAR 13.501(a)(2) requirement to justify a sole source acquisition being conducted pursuant to the Clinger-Cohen Act test program for commercial items:

Restriction of sources for this acquisition is justified in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as Micro Focus is the sole manufacturer for this requirement. Because this software was originally purchased from Micro Focus, the government needs to have Micro Focus take care of the maintenance and upgrades of this product.  It is not in the Governments best interest to award this maintenance acquisition to any other brand.  This is the software used for the major portion of the development of the DSS mainframe and mid-tier system web screens and the maintaining of the Micro Focus APS source code.  To go with another company would require the purchasing of more software which may or may not be compatible with the rest of the system and a complete rewrite of the source code used by DSS.  This would not be cost effective to make additional purchases when only a maintenance contract is needed.

Part Numbers shown in the Schedule of Supplies/Services are Micro Focus.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

-	Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)

-	Parking  30 on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessors control

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)

Solicitation Number:  FDA1060796

Response Date: 4 August 2009

DESCRIPTION:

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-33.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541910 for full and open competition.  

The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the following data and service: 

Medical Device Exposure Dataset Identification and Evaluation

Background:

FDA routinely obtains reports of adverse events occurring throughout the life-cycle of medical devices.  These reports come from the sponsor in the IDE prior to device marketing.  Upon clearance/approval of the device, reports may come from a post-approval study (PAS) or through medical device reports (MDRs).  As opposed to the well documented exposure information in the IDE study, post-marketing exposure to medical devices is difficult to ascertain.  It is often limited to information from passive surveillance or from single-institution case series analysis.

Knowing the number of individuals exposed to a medical device is key to many of FDAs post-marketing efforts to determine whether public safety is maintained throughout the device life-cycle.  Use of exposure data would allow FDA to know the proportion of device users reporting adverse events via MDRs.  It would also allow FDA to determine whether post approval studies have difficulty recruiting due to slow device uptake.  In the event of potential safety signals for a medical device, exposure data would allow FDA to determine the number of people potentially affected by the adverse event as well as whether adequate substitutes for a medical device are present in the marketplace in the event of a recall.

Representative, nationwide data for medical device utilization at the manufacturer and device-specific levels would offer the opportunity to derive more accurate rates of outcomes.  To address this need for better information, FDA is asking for identification and evaluation of potential data sources for exposure to medical devices in the United States.  For this initial assessment, data focused in on of three areas is requested.  The areas of specific interest are gastroenterology/urology/renal, infection control/dental/general hospital/infusion pumps, or neurology/anesthesia/respiratory.

Objectives:

By the end of this evaluation of potential data sources, our objective is to identify the most appropriate medical device exposure dataset(s) available for purchase by or collaboration with FDA to assist with ongoing post-market device safety evaluation.

Scope of Work:

The scope of work of this project is the identification, description, and evaluation of potential U.S. data measuring exposure to commercial medical devices.  Data evaluated in this project should be representative of the population exposed to the devices or able to be extrapolated to represent use in the U.S. population. 

This project shall require a thorough analysis of each set of identified data: (1) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (2) method of data collection and extrapolation to US population; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow-up (if any) and capture of care across all settings; (4) plans for further enhancements; (5) availability, experience and interest of data compilers or investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for surveillance of post-market product performance; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of data, including HIPAA and potential proprietary nature of data; (7) cost of data and updates; and (8) potential barriers that exist to government use of data. 

Medical Devices covered in this project shall include all of the products listed under at least one of the three headings below:

	Gastroenterology, Urology, and Renal

Detailed Requirements:

1.   Identify, in consultation with FDA, potential data that could best describe medical device usage in the U.S. For each dataset, describe the primary purpose; the type of data (i.e., marketing research, registry, survey, etc.); the estimated proportion of device users captured; any follow-up or linked relevant electronic health care data source (e.g., claims data, medical records, radiology reports, etc.), if applicable; and cost of obtaining data.

2.   For each dataset, describe:
(a) Specificity of information to identify medical devices, including newly marketed products.  Does the dataset include information by manufacturer, by device type, or by model number;
(b) Size of population, degree of capture across geographic region, gender, age, and any other specified demographic factors;  
(e) Structure and coding, including consistency with widely recognized standards;
(f) Completeness, timeliness, and accessibility of data, including frequency of data updates;
(h) Potential limitations if used for estimating product uptake (i.e. using numbers as denominator counts for adverse events); 
(b) Information on surgical procedures including, but not limited to, indication for use of device, procedure volume, and technique;
(c) Information regarding method of data collection and extrapolation to U.S. population.

3.   For each dataset, describe prior and current uses of data, including (but not limited to): market research and forecasting, post-market safety surveillance, administrative purposes, quality assessment/improvement and/or benchmarking, academic/industry research. This shall include (but not be limited to):
(a) Representative examples of presentations and/or publications that have been developed using these data;
(b) Description of plans for future data source enhancement, if any;
(c) Letters of support and curriculum vitae from internal and external users/researchers that describe both their experience and knowledge in working with the data and the strengths and potential limitations of working with data source and/or environment, as well as each reference's current and prior relationships (financial or otherwise) with this and other potential data sources.  

4.   For each dataset, research and analyze existing or proposed policies, rules, regulations, and other requirements related to the protection of privacy and safeguards related to HIPAA and potential proprietary nature of dataset.

5.   Provide specific recommendations for next steps to engage the holders of the most promising datasets, including identification of potential liabilities.

<DESC>REQ #  1056781


The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking Full and Open Competition for vendors that can provide quotes/proposals.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant of firm fixed price purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.  NAICS Code  541711

Project Title:  Custom Salmonella/E.Coli Genechip Microarrays


Background:  

The custom Genechip microarrays  are to be utilized with an integrated Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and Fluidics 450s system.  

This project will deliver high density microarrays to interrogate enteric pathogen groups and the pan-genome of the lower gastrointestinal tract commensal microbiota.  This work will provide a useful tool with the capacity to monitor the metabolic and bacterial flux upon challenge, for instance, with pathogen outbreak strains.  In addition, the arrays could have wide applicability towards vulnerable populations (immunocompromised), antibiotic resistance gene reservoirs and transmissibility, exposure to live microbial ingredients, and even the effects of food constituents and additives.  These investigations are not necessarily limited to the human gut microflora, but rather can be expanded to other relevant hosts such as agricultural food producing animals that contribute to zoonotic transmission of foodborne pathogens.  Furthermore, it supports the
Centers mission by investigating potential food risks with new and innovative approaches.

Technical Requirements:

The design and manufacturing of custom E. coli DNA microarrays must comply with the following requirements: 

The arrays must be able to be read/utilized by the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 System.  The GeneChip Scanner 3000 System is a fully integrated platform for conducting research using the Affymetrix GeneChip Custom Genotyping assays and GeneChip probe arrays. The system includes the GeneChip Scanner 3000, Fluidics Station 450s, Hybridization Oven 640, a powerful computer workstation with dual Xeon processors loaded with GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS). 

The arrays must be high-density probe arrays capable of performing quantitative and simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes. 

The arrays must be able to accomodate at least 85,000 unique genes and 1,000 control sequences (85,000 total probe sets).  Furthermore, each of the gene sequence represented on this array must have 11 perfectly matched 25-mer probes as well as 11 mismatch 25-mer probes in order to estimate nonspecific hybridization.  This results in an array capable of accomodating >2,500,000 individual features.  Additionally, the size of each of these features must be 5 microns. 

The arrays must contain the following hybridization controls: bioB, bioC, bioD and cre. 

The arrays must contain a normalization control set of 100 probe sets.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-34.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this 
procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business.  

In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the manufacturer and distributor of these supplies must be a small business in accordance with the NAICS code identified.  

For size purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end item being acquired. The manufacturer is the concern which, with its own facilities, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or organic substances, including the assembly of parts and components, into the end item being acquired.  

The end item must possess characteristics which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not possess before the original substances, parts or components were assembled or transformed.  The end item may be finished and ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semifinished as a raw material to be used in further manufacturing. Firms which perform only minimal operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) uses monochromators for thermal triple axis instruments to select the wavelength of neutrons incident on samples.  To take full advantage of the neutrons available from the source, NIST will construct double focusing monochromators for the BT7 and BT9 thermal triple axis spectrometers.

Ge311 offers a suitable d-spacing for measurements on thermal triple axis instruments, while eliminating the (lambda/2) contamination present in monochromators such as PG 002.  The crystallographic orientation of the wafers is critical.   

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain single crystal wafers of well-oriented Ge311 for the construction of monochromator arrays for the NIST BT7 and BT9 monochromators.

Attachment I is a representation of the orientation of the wafers of Ge that will be produced by the Contractor. This attachment is provided to clarify the orientation and markings described in the specifications.
		
LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity 220 each Ge(311)  0.03 single crystal wafers. The wafers must meet all of the required specifications identified herein.  

For the purpose of this solicitation, the term wafer is being utilized to specify the cut sections of the single crystal. 	

1.  The starting germanium boule must be CZ, single-crystal, with 0-EPD, resistivity < 10 ohm-cm, no lineage, no slip, N-type; 

2.   The wafer must be oriented to Ge(311)  0.03.  To clarify, the (311) plane must be in the plane of the wafer and the <3,1,1> reciprocal lattice vector must be normal to the surface;

3.  The Ge <0,2,-2> face must be normal to the face of the wafer and point along one of the sides (see attached figure)  1;

4.  Each square must be relief-etched to final dimensions of 20.0  0.5mm by 20.0  0.5mm by 8.00  0.05mm thickness; 

5.  Wafers must have a number etched on one side that indicates that it is the <0,2,-2> face.  This face must also have etched two identifiers:  one describing the boule from which the wafer was taken, the other the relative position of that wafer within that boule. A letter identifier shall be used for the boule, and a number identifier for the relative position.  Reference Attachment I for a representation of a wafer with the required orientation.

INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
The quality of the wafers will be determined by inspection of the wafers for size (length, width, and thickness).  The orientation and mosaic of the wafers will be inspected by members of the NIST/Thermal Triple Axis Team, using neutrons to determine if they are oriented to within the required tolerances.  

NIST will inspect no less than 3 wafers from each boule used.  The inspections will occur within 60 days of receipt of the wafers.

In the event any wafer is found to be non-compliant with specifications, the wafer must be re-manufactured at the Contractors expense.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all shipping charges, and shipping liability, resulting from the rework or remake of the parts. 

WARRANTY
Per the inspection and acceptance criteria, the Government will inspect no less than three wafers from each boule used.  As the Government cannot test every wafer upon receipt, the Contractor must agree to a warranty period of six (6) months from the date of acceptance of each batch of wafers.  The warranty period shall commence upon final acceptance for each batch.  All wafers must be warranted to meet all specifications stated herein.  

The Government understands that the Contractor does NOT warrant the wafers for the purpose intended by the Government, however, does warrant that the wafers shall meet all required specifications.   

In the event any wafer is found to be non-compliant with specifications, the wafer must be re-manufactured at the Contractors expense.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all shipping charges, and shipping liability, resulting from the rework or remake of the parts. 

DELIVERY
The Contractor shall propose a delivery schedule for the wafers.  The Contractor shall propose a batch size (number of wafers per batch) and delivery date for each batch.  A minimum of three batches is required and the minimum batch size must be 20 wafers.  

The Contractor shall notify the NIST Technical Contact, not later than 30 days prior to shipment of each batch of wafers.  This notification is necessary to plan the acceptance testing of the 
wafers.

All wafers must be delivered not later than eight (8) months from the date of award. 

Delivery term shall be FOB Destination.  The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  All shipments must be marked as FRAGILE.

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a need for a multiuse, high-resolution, x-ray diffraction system. The system must be capable of thin film diffraction, reflectivity, grazing incidence diffraction (GID), transmission and reflection small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), pole figures, texture analysis, reciprocal space mapping, and in-plane diffraction. The system must also be able to easily change between focused optics and a collimated beam with slits to accommodate grazing incidence. It is highly desired that the system has self- or auto-aligning capability. The system must be modular to allow ease of changing optical configurations needed for different measurement techniques.<br />General Capabilities Overview<br />1. The x-ray diffraction (XRD)system must be capable and include all of the components to perform and analyze all of the following measurements: conventional thin film &theta;/2 &theta; measurements, bulk and/or powder &theta;/2 &theta; measurements, thin film high-resolution x-ray diffraction (HR-XRD), X-ray reflectivity (XRR), grazing incidence diffraction (GID) with both in-plane and out-of-plane measurements, pole figures, texture analysis, rocking curves, reciprocal space maps, in-plane diffraction, and small angle x-ray scatting (SAXS) in both reflection and transmission. Typical samples include: polycrystalline and epitaxial metallic and ceramic films and multilayers which range in thickness from 2 nm to 150 nm deposited on 3 inch wafers; nanoparticles ranging from 4 nm to 40 nm in diameter in solution or self-organized on a wafer surface; bulk samples such as sputtering targets. The configuration should be optimized for such sample analysis.<br />2. XRD system must be modular in design to easily exchange optical configurations, modes of operation, and to allow future upgrades in capabilities.<br />3. It is highly desired that alignment of x-ray source, optics, sample and detector is performed via an automated procedure (or alternative method) to minimize or eliminate the need for the operator to perform manual alignment. If an automated procedure, alignment routines and script must be provided for all optical configurations. <br />X-ray Source<br />1. Focused electron beam source, preferably with a 0.4 mm x 12 mm line focus.<br />2. Must have a Cu target with a K_beta filter either in the source or diffracted optics.<br />3. Must have a beam voltage of at least 40 kV with at least 1.8 kW operational x-ray tube power. Higher voltages and output powers are desired.<br />4. It is desired that the source have both line and point source output. Switching between modes of operation must be easy and straightforward without a significant realignment process. This capability is more critical if in-plane measurements are achieved by a 90 degree chi rotation of the sample<br />Goniometer and sample stage/cradle<br />1. Goniometer and cradle system must be capable of achieving scattering geometries to perform in-plane and out-of-plane scans, pole figure, reciprocal space maps, rocking curves, reflectivity, grazing incidence, small angle diffraction and transmission scattering.<br />2. Must have at least a step size of 0.0001 degrees in detector theta and source theta (or sample omega angle if x-ray source is fixed).<br />3. Must include a completely motorized Eularian (or equivalent) cradle mount able to accommodate both 3 inch wafers and small samples. Cradle must have x- and y-translation with at least 10 micron step size, a z-translation with at least a 1 micron step size, as well as full 360 sample azimuthal rotation (phi), and tilt (chi or psi) of at least a quarter circle. It is desired that the sample have additional tilt axes such that once the sample tilt is aligned, phi rotations do not alter the sample tilt alignment.<br />4. Must include a capillary sample stage for transmission small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and diffraction measurements of suspended nanopartcles. It is preferred that the capillary stage has a motorized rotation.<br />5. If additional or alternative sample cradles are needed for a specified measurement outlined in the general capabilities section, those must also be included and described.<br />6. Detector and source must be mounted on independent theta axes (or sample omega rotation if x-ray source is fixed) for asymmetric scans .<br />7. System must have an automated sample position and tilt alignment capability.<br />8. It is preferred that the goniometer angle positions are encoded.<br />Detector<br />1. Must have either a scintilator detector or proportional counter detector with at least a linear dynamic range of 500,000 cps and a maximum sensitivity/background of 2 cps. All high voltage supplies and electronics must be included.<br />2. Must have a computer controlled set of attenuators either on the source or diffracted beam.<br />3. We request inclusion of an additional 1-D or 2-D detector for rapid texture analysis as an option in the quote. <br />Optics and configuration<br />1. Must be capable of both parallel beam and focused (Bragg-Brentano) beams and easily changeable between both modes of operation.<br />2. Must include a full set of beam masks, anti-scatter slits, divergence slits, height limiting slits, receiving slits, beam shaping slits.<br />3. Must include a computer controlled set of beam attenuators.<br />4. Must include a Gobel (or equivalent) x-ray mirror or for generating a parallel beam. <br />5. Must have a diffracted beam monochromator for both parallel and focused beams to suppress signals from sample fluorescence and Cu K_beta emission. <br />6. Must include Soller slits with a maximum axial divergence angle of 5 deg and one with a maximum divergence of 0.06. <br />7. We request inclusion of additional intermediate Soller slits module for the diffracted beam with an axial acceptance angle below 3 deg and above 1 deg as an option in the quote.<br />8. Must have a parallel plate collimator with an angular divergence below 0.2 deg. Additional parallel plate collimators are desired with higher values of divergence.<br />9. We request a removable two bounce Ge monochromator (or equivalent) on the source beam for higher resolution measurements as an option. This should have a maximum divergence of 32 arcsec.<br />10. We request an x-ray capillary lens as an option in the quote<br />NIST recognize that in some cases, multiple optical configurations can be used to for a particular measurement and will achieve a similar result. Alternative configurations that deviate from the exact configurations described above will be considered with explanation as to how such a solution will provide the same result and quality of measurement.</p>
<p>Software/Computer<br />1. Must have easy to use graphical software interface to allow non-expert operation.<br />2. Software must have full operational control of x-ray source, goniometer, sample stage, measurement parameters and settings.<br />3. Must have built in protection to prevent damage to XRD system (such as crashing detector into x-ray source or overpowering x-ray source) <br />4. State of the art computer system with all necessary flat panel monitors and peripherals. System and software must run on Windows XP (Vista is not allowed at NIST)<br />5. Must include a color printer.<br />6. It is desired to have visualization software for crystal structure and/or reciprocal space and scattering geometry.<br />7.

Fredrick Douglas House Emergency Operation Plan Q3000090457Fixed Price - Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements Contract
BACKGROUNDThe Frederick Douglass National Historic Site (FRDO) is a two-story structure built in the 1850's with an attic and basement that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  The building has outside dimensions of 70 feet by 38 feet, exclusive of the front porch and a height that is approximately 32 feet.  The first and second floors occupy a space of approximate 1,750 sq ft each.  The  attic has an area of approximately 980 sq ft and the basement is approximately 580 sq ft.
The building is a combustible, wood frame structure consisting of wood structural and partition framing members with plaster on lath wall and ceiling materials, wood flooring, and some wood finish members.  As built, these materials are expected to offer minimal fire resistance, and may be capable of providing enough fuel loading to support an uncontrolled fire of approximately two to three hours duration.
The Frederick Douglass House is operated as a house museum, with an occupant load of less than 25 persons and retains features that were found when it was used as a private residence.  Fuel loading is typical for a 19th century residential facility with combustibles consisting of paper, cardboard, wood furnishings, and natural fabrics.
The adjacent cottage is a single story wood framed building of approximately 64 feet x 42 feet in dimensions for a floor area of approximately 2,400 ft2.  The cottage is operated as an administrative office structure, with an occupant load of less than 10 persons.  
The Growlery is a small one-room structure of rough stone masonry with a crude wooden door, no windows, and a brick fireplace/chimney.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This Request for Quotation has been made available through electronic commerce to comply with the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(e)) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 416), that requires contracting officers to disseminate information on proposed contract actions for proposed contract actions expected to exceed $10,000, but not expected to exceed $25,000, by displaying in a public place, or by any appropriate electronic means. Due to the limited amount of public places for posting at North Cascades National Park, and the remote locations and accessibility of field sites, electronic posting is utilized to comply with public posting and to promote competition to the maximum extent practical.
This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-35.  This solicitation is reserved for small businesses, NAICS 332312, Fabricated Structural Metal Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  Note that non-manufacturer small businesses must offer the product of a small business to qualify for the set-aside.  The National Park Service encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.  The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose total offer represents the best value for the Government, price and other factors considered. 
Background:North Cascades National Park Service Complex (NOCA), Skagit District, has twenty docks and gangways on our lakes and intends to replace most of these docks and gangways within the next five years. These facilities are located on reservoirs that experience wide fluctuations in lake level throughout the year and windy conditions. The terrain on which this dock settles during low water levels is uneven and rocky.  The docks are used by canoes, kayaks and small power boats. 
In 2009, NOCA seeks to purchase at least one prefabricated floating dock and one associated gangway for use on Ross Lake.  If funding becomes available, we may exercise an option for additional docks and/or gangways.  The option may be exercised any time before September 30, 2009. 
Statement of work:Contractors shall design, fabricate and deliver one dock and gangway, plus any additional options exercised, per the minimum requirements of this solicitation. Offers will be evaluated using the "Evaluation Factors" below.
It is our intent to procure commercially available docks with interchangeable and/or replaceable components, such as floats, deck panels, cleats, and rub rails.  Consequently, designs need to facilitate the removal, replacement, and repair of dock components such as pontoons, cleats, deck sections, rub rail, gangway attachment, etc.  The structural integrity of the dock needs to be designed to withstand repeated twisting and settling on rigid obstacles.  Some of our current gangways have been damaged by environmental stresses, twisting and wracking.  The new gangways need to be structurally designed and constructed by the contractor to withstand these damaging influences.  
Minimum design requirements:Each dock section shall measure 8' wide by 20' long. The gangway(s) shall measure 30' long by 5' wide and be ADA-accessible compliant with handrails.  Adequate floatation shall be provided for coupled gangway and dock sections such that the dock sections float level while under deadload conditions.  Dock flotation shall be polystyrene foam-filled virgin grade polyethylene or HDPE encasement. Floats shall be provided with protection from grounding on gravel/rock beach surface. All steel members shall be hot dip galvanized after fabrication or stainless steel. Dock decking shall be flow-through decking of either fiberglass-reinforced polypropylene or aluminum-reinforced polypropylene, or approved equal. There shall be a continuous handrail along both outside edges of the access bridge. The distance between the access bridge deck and the top of the handrail shall be 34 inches.  All fasteners shall be Stainless Steel type 18-8 (Grade 304) or approved equal.  Cleats shall be installed at 8' OC, securely attached and readily replaceable.
The actual freeboard of the floating dock and gangway installation, under dead load condition only, shall be not less than 7 inches and not greater than 12 inches after assembly. Dead load shall consist of all materials of the entire dock system plus attachments. The freeboard of the float and gangway installation plus a live load of 30 lbs. per square foot shall be not less than 7 inches.  
The rub rail subsurface shall be attached as to prevent damage to boats.  The rub rail shall be P style rub-rail with a sloped bottom half.  Rub rail shall be flexible white PVC with UV inhibitors, minimum of 1.3 pounds per foot, attached with flat washers and deck screws.
The gangway and attachment to dock shall be designed to allow free movement on a vertical plane and accommodate changing water levels. The anchorage system between the gangway and the shore bulkhead and the connection system between the gangway and floating docks shall be of materials adequate to withstand all expected design loads.  The Contractor shall provide all shore-end and wet-end gangway connection devices and dock-to-dock connectors. NPS bulkhead connections use approximately " pipe, 6' long.  NPS shall provide exact dimensions and template information at time of notice to proceed with fabrication.  NPS will install the dock and gangway at the lake.
The gangway shall be fabricated of aluminum.  The gangway shall not exceed a deflection of 1/180.  The decking for the access bridge shall be aluminum grating and shall have a slip-resistant aluminum SlipNOT surface, as manufactured and supplied by W.S. Molnar Company (www.slipnot.com or 800-SLIPNOT) or approved equal.
Offerors are encouraged to recommend details that, in their experience, will improve the quality of the docks for our intended use, and list these items separately in the offer with their associated prices.  
STANDARD COMPLIANCE: When materials or equipment must conform to the standards of organizations such as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Underwriter's Laboratories (UL), proof of such conformance shall be submitted to the NPS for approval.  If an organization uses a label or listing to indicate compliance with a particular standard, the label or listing will be acceptable evidence.  In lieu of the label or listing, submit a certificate from an independent testing organization, which is competent to perform the test.  The certificate shall state that the item has been tested in accordance with the specified organization's standard.
DELIVERY AND PAYMENT: Individual dock sections and gangways shall be delivered fully assembled but not connected to one another.  Delivery is required within 90 days after receipt of order.  Delivery shall be made to the Marblemount Ranger Station, 7280 Ranger Station Road, Marblemount, WA 98267; approximately 50 miles east of Interstate 5.  Substantial acceptance will be made at the same location and payment of 95% of the price will be processed.  Final acceptance and payment of the remaining 5% will be made once the floats are in the water and compliance with freeboard and leveling specifications is confirmed.  The contractor will be required to remedy any noncompliance with freeboard or leveling specifications at no cost to the government.
Price Schedule: 1.	 6' x 20' dock section	1 each			$______________2.	 4' x 30' gangway		1 each			$______________3.	Option for additional 6' x 20' dock sections 		$______________ each4.	Option for additional 4' x 30' gangways 			$______________ eachNote: Include price for delivery in each line item.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

GOVERNMENT FURNISHED INFORMATION AND EQUIPMENT

1)  In accordance with Chapter 3 of DFAS Regulation 8400.1-R, personally owned workstations, laptop computers, software and printers, including computers connected to the DISP, will not be connected to the DFAS Enterprise Local Area Network (ELAN).  This prohibition is a security requirement to protect the ELAN from the spread of malicious logic (viruses and Trojan Horse programs) and to protect sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information from being compromised.  Contractors performing duties in a DFAS facility may be provided DFAS owned workstations and printers.  If the awarded contract specifies that the contractor is responsible for providing its employees with workstations and printers, these devices must have ELAN connection approval in writing from the Infrastructure Services Organization, Director of Infrastructure Management.  Approval for connection to the ELAN is contingent on the contractor-furnished equipment meeting all stipulations cited in paragraphs C3.3.2.1 through C3.3.2.9 of Chapter 3 of DFAS Regulation 8400.1-R dated November 2003.

2)  The contractor will notify the DFAS LAN support personnel prior to permanently removing any previously connected workstations from DFAS property.  Laptop computers, which are taken home by contractors, will not be erased until the person is permanently removed from the DFAS project or the laptop is being removed from DFAS ELAN service.  The Government personnel will zero the disk drive(s) using Government approved (Ghost 7-pass) software.  This ensures that DFAS licensed software and sensitive but unclassified and privacy act protected information is not removed from Government control. 

3)  Copies of DFAS Regulation 8400.1-R are available from the Government TA

The Period of Performance (POP) will be: October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010.

Basis For Brand Name Requirement:  The parts, materials, and components required for the instant acquisition must be completely compatible with the existing PBX infrastructure in order to support mission operations during the normal operation of the PBX system.  If the Government does not acquire equipment that is completely compatible with the current equipment, the Government may not have operable PBX telecommunication equipment and potentially will not meet the mission essential requirements at DFAS-PE.  NEC certified parts, materials, and components are the only parts that will work in a NEC PBX.  There is currently no other manufacturer of NEC compatible parts that meet the Governments requirements.  NEC  Compatible equipment is only available from NEC Authorized Distributors that is built to the manufactures specifications.  If compatible equipment is not utilized, the PBX equipment would not function properly and would require the Government to replace the entire PBX telecommunication system (which has not met its end of life cycle) in order to maintain mission essential operations.  The estimated cost to replace the PBX system is $100,000.00 to $250,000.00 and a new system would also result in the loss of $325,000.00 already invested in the current system.  Additionally DFAS-PE is scheduled to close under BRAC on 20 Nov 2010 and an investment in a new PBX system is not feasible as the new equipment will not have met its end of life cycle prior to the closure of DFAS-PE. 

Having an unauthorized service provider maintain and service the current Government-Owned equipment may provide a short term financial savings, but these short term savings will put the Government at risk for the failure of the PBX system, and the possibility of extended downtime, which would limit the Governments ability to provide adequate service to our customers.  Service performed by a non-authorized maintenance provider would place the Government in the position of potentially not being able to meet mission essential requirements due to the inoperable PBX telecommunication equipment.  An unauthorized technician does not have access to the required material, parts, and components required to maintain the NEC PBX or NEC technical support experts at NEC.  Whereas, NEC Authorized Technicians have the ability to obtain NEC technical support experts who are capable of solving issues and problems with the PBX system that the NEC Authorized technician can not solve on-site and have immediate access to NEC certified parts, materials, and components required to maintain the NEC PBX system.  This extended technical support offered by NEC Corporation is integral in keeping the PBX system operational and restoring the PBX system in an emergency.  This extended technical support is only available to NEC Authorized Distributors with NEC Certified Technicians.  Additionally if the PBX is not operational, DFAS-PE will not have access to incoming and outgoing calls that are integral to the mission essential requirements of DFAS-PE.

The Government has determined that Only NEC Authorized Distributors with NEC Certified Technicians are capable of supporting and meeting the requirements of the instant acquisition and the instant acquisition shall be processed in as Brand Name basis as detailed above.  Competition shall be requested from NEC Authorized Distributors with NEC Certified Technicians.

<DESC>******************************************The purpose of this amendment is to add attachment #1 (past performance questionnaire) to solicitation.  This announcement is hereby extended until July 23, 2009 @ 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.******************************************************

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541712, is to notify contractors that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking competition of this requirement in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procures.

Under the simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.  This synopsis is designated for 100% Small Business Set Aside competition for a fixed price purchase order.  Prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation.  Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

This combined synopsis solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ).  The FDA intends to award a purchase order to extend the HL7 SPL standard to include the data elements required for food and medical device product facility registration and food and medical device product listing data for processing, reviewing, and archiving by FDA. The Statement of Work is as follows:

I.  Background

FDA is charged with protecting the safety and security of the United States food and drug supply.

On September 28, 2005, Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Homeland Security announced the issuance of the Bioterrorism Act Food Facilities Registration Final Rule.  This rule requires domestic and foreign facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food for consumption in the United States to register with FDA.  The rule implemented the food facilities registration provision of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. 

FDA has been collecting the food facility registration data in a format which is not consistent with the standard utilized to collect other FDA-regulated facility and product data.   The standardization of the format of regulatory data received by the agency will afford an opportunity for FDA to share data amongst its centers and other Federal agencies using one standard and store that data in a single authoritative database which is based on the Health Level Seven (HL7) Reference Information Model (RIM).

II. Objective

In support of the FDA Product Quality Compliance Business Review Boards Harmonized Inventory project, which was approved by the Bioinformatics Board, a health and regulatory data standard to be utilized by industry to generate food facility registration and food product listing information files for submission to FDA is needed. In the spirit of harmonization, the Structured Product Labeling (SPL) standard should also be extended to accommodate medical device product files for submission to FDA. One of the purposes of the Harmonized Inventory project is to create a reliable, complete, up-to-date, master inventory of FDA-related firms, facilities and products, and their associated information.  

As of July 2008, FDA began receiving electronic drug establishment registration and drug listing data.  The HL7 SPL standard is the data standard which permits the capture of content of labeling, drug establishment registration and drug listing data in a format that FDA can process, review, and archive.  The centralized storage of this standardized data, which will include food facility registration and food product data, in the Agencys HL7 RIM-based database permits the tracking of registered facilities which manufacture multiple types of regulated products and the product-component/ingredient data.  Standardization of the data will also assist in the improvement of the accuracy, validation, capturing, and integration of regulatory data as well as the facilitation of design of reporting and analytical tools.

Food facility registration and food and medical device product listing SPL documents submitted to the FDA need to undergo quality control to ensure that the data conform to SPL XML schema and FDA business rules.   A Schematron document will be utilized to validate the data submitted in food facility registration and food and medical device product listing SPL documents to ensure conformance with the SPL schema and FDA business validation procedures.

An implementation guide is needed by the FDA-regulated foods and medical device industry to create SPL files for submission to FDA.  This implementation guide is an HL7 document that is used by industry and SPL software developers who create HL7 SPL messages with food and medical device facility registration and product listing data for submission to FDA.

The foods and medical device product industry and FDA employees will need to view the data in foods SPL documents submitted to FDA.  SPL documents, which are XML documents can be rendered and displayed in hypertext markup (HTML) or XHTML language using an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT).  XSLT is the language that can be utilized to transform XML document into HTML or XHTML documents.  The SPL XSLT stylesheet specifies the default font, indentation, orientation, formatting, word wrapping, line spacing, and other properties that will be used for the display of product information submitted in SPL format.

III. Scope

<DESC>Question that had been asked to NRCS in regards to the cost of title insurance, please see question asked and answer below:

QUESTION:  In Part I-The Schedule, Section B, USDA is asking my company to supply a Quote for Title Insurance Premium for $1000 Value.  What does this $1000 Value relate too?  Is this asking for $1000 per easement or some other figure such as the purchase price?  If it is another number, could you provide a range of purchase prices in the past?  

ANSWER:  The question is asking for a cost of title insurance per $1,000 value of the easement. 
Example: What is the cost of title insurance where the government has acquired an easement for $500,000? This needs to be expressed in cost/1000 dollars

 Section M-Evaluation Factors for Award changed from 100 total possible points to 80 points.

Delivery Date changed to July 22, 2009


Questions from Vendor with Answers from NRCS:

QUESTION: 1.  Is this contract seeking a Super Vendor which can handle title searches and closings in all 23 counties of Maryland? 

ANSWER: Yes, we are looking for a vendor that has the ability to handle title searches in all 23 counties
 
QUESTION:  2.  Are we in a stronger position if we submit bids for all 5 zones?
    
ANSWER: no

QUESTION:  3.  Does it weaken our chances to submit bids for only one or two zones?  In other words, if we are rated the best bid for the zones we bid for, will we be at a disadvantage if the second best bidder has submitted bids for all 5 zones? 
	
ANSWER: no
 
QUESTION:  4.If we will need to rely on subcontractors for title searches and closings in distant locations, do those subcontractors need to be disclosed in our bid?

ANSWER: No as long as the results meet the standards
 
QUESTION:  5. Will the buyer be preparing the Deeds, Covenants, Easement and other instruments to be recorded?  if so, this will lessen the cost of legal fees.  

ANSWER:  Yes NRCS prepares the deeds and everything associated with deeds including closing instructions, the closing agent will do the final title review then either NRCS completes the closing of the easement if necessary or else the closing agent will complete this step. 
We do not anticipate a change in the cost of the legal fees.


Questions from vendor and answers from NRCS:

QUESTION:  1.   How many closings do you order during the year?

ANSWER:     This is dependent on the amount of funds Congress allocates for the program. The past three years there have been 3-5 closings in a year. 

 
QUESTION:  2. Who prepares the package that OGC reviews:  the contractor or NRCS? 
 
ANSWER:  NRCS will prepare the package for OGC. This will consist of the preliminary title review and boundary survey. 

 
QUESTION:  3. It appears that a contractor will not update the title commitment nor include the legal description for the easement area in an updated commitment until a request is made to close?  Is this correct? 
 

ANSWER:  Yes. 

 
QUESTION:  4.  How long will transpire between the time a contractor submits the preliminary title commitment and they are requested to close the transaction? 

ANSWER:  This will vary. Past closings have been up to a year after the preliminary title commitment. The goal is to have these closed within 6mos from the preliminary review. 

 QUESTION:  5.  In our other NRCS title and closing services contracts we are only to provide guidance to the landowner regarding curative work.  Is this correct for your solicitation? 

ANSWER:  This is correct. Any corrective actions (subordinations, etc.) are the responsibility of the landowner. NRCS may suggest working with the title vendor; however the cost is their responsibility. 

QUESTION:  6.  Will the contractor be responsible for disbursing the proceeds to the landowner? 
 
ANSWER:  No. NRCS policy requires a direct deposit of funds to the program participants. 

QUESTION:  7.  Will the contractor have a period of time to accept or reject an order (24-48 hours)? 
 
ANSWER:  This was not considered in the solicitation but it probably would be good to consider based on vendor workload. If the contract officer approves, this might be written into the work order.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  USAID assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  USAID uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate USAID retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  

INTRODUCTION

In August 2002, USAID began implementation of a program in Venezuela to provide assistance to maintain democratic stability and strengthen the countrys fragile democratic institutions.  The USAID Venezuela program operates out of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas and is part of a larger U.S. government effort to promote democratic stability in Venezuela. The program includes a flexible, small grants program which supports activities that promote peaceful resolution of the current political crisis through facilitating dialogue, public debate on key issues, support to democratic institutions, and the promotion of citizen participation and democratic leadership.  The program also supports Venezuelan civil society organizations that work on a variety of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, health care and legislative and judicial system monitoring.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to ensure that USAID has a highly-qualified country representative in the field that will represent USAID and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

The Country Representative is a member of the DCHA Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) Regional Team, reports to the Regional Team Leader, and is based in Caracas as the senior USAID representative in the country.  This post is a family-accompanied post and does allow minor and/or adult dependents.      

The Country Representatives principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of USAIDs Venezuela country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent USAIDs mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.  

Duties and Responsibilities

The work of the USAID Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based USAID Regional Team Leader for Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), the Country Representative will:

	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;

	Serve as USAIDs primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;

	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;

	Communicate and coordinate USAID in-country activities between USAID and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;

	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, and evaluate the performance of in-country USAID staff;

	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief USAID and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;

	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partners scope to USAIDs country objectives, partners budgets, and modifications thereto;

	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the ADS (USAIDs Automated Directives System);

	Ensure that USAIDs programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS:

QUESTION #1:  My question is related to Answer #10 (Questions and Answers) as shown below.  In terms of the GFE, is the Government referring to the Aerial Refueling System?  

If so, will the Government procure these items separately once a contractor and airframe are chosen for this effort?

Also, there is the mention of a "roll on/roll off" system.  Has the government already selected a system or is this more an expression of intent?
 
Answer #10:  The government will outfit both the primary and second A/C for use with Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).  This is the most effective way to handle this type of situation.  The GFE will be a roll on/roll off system for the A/C.  It will not stay on both A/Cs permanently.

ANSWER #1:  All GFE referred to in the package is additional equipment other than refueling (i.e. electronics to track and record Aircraft position).  All contractors must have a full working refueling system already in place.


QUESTION #2:  In reviewing the Draft PWS, is it the intent of the requirement to have the Primary Type V aircraft have a non-stop flight range of 4,350nm and be able to off-load 65K of fuel or is the range figure for positioning flights, etc.
 
The reasoning being is that the aircraft cannot cover 4350nm in a 6hr time frame, and would the 6hr mission window be 3hrs out / 3 hrs return or fly a 6hr track, land and refuel?

ANSWER #2: 	We are looking for an aircraft that has a range of at least 4350 NM and be able to offload 65K of fuel.  This is for Cross-country/water drags of multiple aircraft.  

Time 6 hours:  Our missions can last 6 hrs and are not necessarily associated with the 4350 NM.  Missions could be either a point to point or a single base.  



WE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTING ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS OF TODAY (2:00 p.m.), EASTERN TIME LOCAL TIME

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment 2 is to provide question and answers and establish July 23, 2009, 5:00 pm EST as the deadline for questions.
<p>Question: Can you please define "manufactured in another country". What part of manufacturing can not be performed outside of the USA? Can subcomponents (ie sand or packaging material) come from outside of the USA? What if the glass is bent outside of the USA but final cut, inspected, packaged and shipped in the USA? It would be helpful if you could highlight the specific contract language that prohibits "manufactured in another country". Also is this a security stipulation or a BUY AMERICAN type restriction?</p>
<p>Answer: Clause 52.225-1 Buy American Act - Supplies, is applicable to this acquisition and full detail about the implementation of the Buy American Act is described in FAR 25.1 - Buy American Act - Supplies. Full text for the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) can be found at www.acquisition.gov/far. In addition to the Buy American Act requiring that the products be manufactured in the United States, it is a security condition for this acquisition.</p>
<p>Question: Could you explain how the two-phase process works?</p>
<p>Answer: In the Solicitation document under M-2 Source Selection Factors / Criteria, you will find a description of the two-phase process.</p>

This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars. The M&O Contractor DUNS number is 175252894. The description of the work involved under this Work Authorization is shown below:

This project accelerates work that has already been identified in the associated sites baselines and the disposition of a specific inventory of TRU waste. LANS is to provide technical support services for this work. Scope include but is not limited to the following:
	Support for characterization of TRU waste in large waste containers and drums stored at Pad 1 at SRS for disposition (to support the cleanup of legacy TRU waste at SRS [South Carolina]).

	Support for characterization of TRU waste to support near-term completion of TRU waste cleanup from small quantity sites (e.g., LBNL, and GEVNC [California], ANL [Illinois], and BAPL [Pennsylvania], etc.) through shipment to INL for waste certification prior to final shipment to WIPP for disposal.
	The established Recovery Act Project Baseline Summary (PBS) is CB-1000.

Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Contract for WA*: Acceleration of work currently under this contract.  Cost reimbursable type contract.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION. This action is Work Authorization KC/AL08/9/ARRA-1, issued under M&O Contract number DE-AC04-94AL85000, which is funded by Recovery Act dollars. The M&O Contractor DUNS number is 007113228. The Work Authorization scope of work covers equipment to update, upgrade, and expand capabilities of the center for Integrated Nanotechnologies Facility to conduct leading-edge science and serve users. 

The funds will be used to acquire the following:
- High Performance Computer Cluster at the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies
- Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) System Imaging Microscope
- Multi-Photon Laser Scanning Confocal and Fluorescence Lifetime Imagine Microscope
- High Resolution X-Ray diffraction (XRD) instrument with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), non-ambient conditions, thin-film and microdiffraction capabilities

Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Contract for WA*: The Work Authorization is priced as an Other than Fixed Price action.  Work assigned to Sandia Corporation through the issuance of Work Authorizations (WAs) is pursuant to the terms and conditions of the prime management and operating contract. The use of a separate fixed price award to Sandia Corporation for the WA is inappropriate because this is a Research and Development Work Authorization issued under an existing cost reimbursable contract. 
					
Place of Contract Performance: Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM

<ARCHDATE>08162009
<AWARDEE>Earth Resources Technology (ERT), 10810 Guilford Rd., Suite 105, AnnapolisJunction, MD 20701
<DESC>This action has been awarded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act(ARRA) of 2009.  In compliance with this Act, the Government posts this notice that TaskOrder (TO) 27 was issued under contract NNJ08JB01C, the Environmental Contract, toprocure environmental services in support of Hurricane Ike Phase II roof repairs fundedby the Recovery Act.  The environmental services under this TO support the roofreplacements known as Roof Package 1, contracted for under Contract NNJ09JD50C.  Theenvironmental services include environmental compliance oversight, industrial solid wastetransportation and disposal, and review of all plans, specifications, and drawings toensure environmental requirements are included in each roof replacement project. Inaddition, modification 55 was issued for associated funding, modification 56 was issuedto revise the procedures for invoicing, and modification 57 was issued to add clausesapplicable to the ARRA of 2009. &lt;P&gt;The Environmental Contract was awarded on a competitive basis.	This TO was issued underthe cost-type contract arrangement in accordance with the contract.  A cost-typearrangement is appropriate due to uncertainties involved in contract performance that donot permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-pricecontract. In addition, a cost-type contract was selected to provide the contractor thegreatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of servicesto be performed.  This Environmental Contract has experienced personnel and documentedperformance to mitigate the Government's risk.	&lt;P&gt;In order to meet the requirements of the Recovery Act in the most prudent businessmanner, within the time constraints imposed, the existing Environmental Contract is themost appropriate contractual vehicle for the work required.  &lt;P&gt;Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. &lt;P&gt;

<DESC>RECOVERY. Work for this project consists of clearing debris and mineralization from the existing radial drains within the North and South Seepage Control Adits, Abiquiu Dam, Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. The intent and purpose of this work is to clear radial drains and allow for unrestricted flow of seepage water that is collected by the Seepage Adits.  The Contractor shall provide all plans, labor, materials, shop facilities, supervision, tools, staging, scaffolding and any other items necessary for hydraulic/mechanical clearing of drains in the Adits.  Contractor shall identify and utilize all necessary power, lighting, safety requirement etc. from the existing power sources at the facility.  Depths of drains vary from 20 to 200 feet.  Drains are installed in 3-inch diameter core holes drilled into interlayered mudstone, sandstone and conglomerate and are lined with 1.5-inch ID, Schedule 80 PVC pipe.  During construction, water-bearing zones were identified<BR>  in the core holes and perforated PVC pipe sections were located accordingly.  Solid PVC pipe sections have butyl packers attached to secure the entire assembly within the core hole.  Generally speaking, drains are oriented from 9 - 34 down from horizontal and from   56  82 up from the horizontal.  The North and South Adits can be accessed by way of paved and semi-improved dirt roads.  Access to the Adits will be provided by the Government.  Adits are 10 feet high and 9 feet wide.  Figure 2 shows a typical section that illustrates the Adits with the radial drain layout.<BR><BR>Contract duration is 180 calendar days.  NAICS Code 561790 with a size standard of $7 Million.

<DESC><p>Sole Source / Brand Name Justification
<p>This requirement is for the purchase of 40 BRI-RIC Ricoh GPS camera kits from BrimTek, Inc. for $75,800.00. These camera kits are needed to support technical operations covert video surveillance program.</p>
<p>The Special Operations Ricoh GPS Camera Kit (P/N: BRI-RIC) is only available from BrimTek, Inc. and is the only camera kit of its kind. Although the Ricoh camera itself is available from other sources, and there are other camera systems that are GPS technology capable, no other camera kits incorporate all of the capabilities included with this kit and the benefit of the BRI-RIC kit over assembling a kit from individual components includes the unique software developed and sold solely by BrimTek, and the custom cut, water resistant travel case made exclusively by Brimtek for this kit.</p>
<p>The unique software, designed to work with the components of this kit, allows for surveillance photo analysis that previously required the photographer to take copious notes and sketches.</p>
<p>There is only one available source and no other item will satisfy the requirement. Therefore contracting without providing for full and open competition is justified.</p>
