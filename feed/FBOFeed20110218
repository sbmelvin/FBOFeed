<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend contract NAS2-02090 with Lockheed on a sole-source basispursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  The performance periodwill be extended for a potential twelve month period, consisting of a six month baseperiod, and six one-month options.The principle purpose of this contract is to support science, space, exploration effortsthrough discrete programs and projects.  At NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) the Programsand Projects Directorate conducts and manages programs, projects, develops and executesmissions.  Support requirements span multiple Directorates at ARC, other NASA Centers andNASA Headquarters.  In order for the various Directorates to develop, manage, and executeprograms within its mission area, research and development is required in the areas ofProgram Management, Project Management, Program Support, Collaborative Technologies,Engineering, Hardware and Software Systems Engineering and Educational Outreach.The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NAS2-02090,for six (6) months, from June 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011 for the base period; andend on May 31, 2012 if all six one-month options are exercised.  The extension willincrease the current contract value.  The extension is the Governments best interest toprovide ongoing Programs and Projects services until a new contract is awarded.  Thecurrent  Contractor, Lockheed is considered the only Contractor that can meet ARCs needsgiven the short period of performance for the extension.  Awarding the potential twelvemonth contract to another Contractor at the same time the recompete is in the processwould result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected tobe recovered through competition of the extension as well as unacceptable delays infulfilling ARCs critical requirements.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30pm local time onMonday, March 7, 2011.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences, intends to award a sole source contract to Fisher Scientific, 3970 Johns Creek Court, Suite 500, Suwannee, GA 30024 for the purchase of five (5) hydrogen gas generators which includes installation and warranty services. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 423490, Other Professional Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers. The period of performance for this procurement is 3 months. <br /><br />These generators will be used to generate the hydrogen needed with a flow rate of 500ml/min for the existing GC/MSD instruments which provides quantitative concentrations for the measurement of trans fatty acids in human plasma and serum. The hydrogen generators with this technology will facilitate the analysis of trans fatty acids in a robust, timely and consistent manner for high sample preparation throughput for the compelling CDC NHANES survey and for biomonitoring studies.<br /><br />No other products can meet the program requirements. Fisher Scientific is the only vendor that can provide the compatible gas generators as offered to prevent delays in continuity of program activities. Only Fisher Scientific can meet the urgent and compelling project requirements and are the only ones able to overcome the time, budget constraints, technical comparability and product constraints with the distribution of these unique products.

Fisher Scientific is the only vendor that can provide the requested generators with the same specifications, service, installation, warranty service, maintenance and ease of use, and quality of product that is currently in the lab. Fisher Scientific is the only contractor that can perform all of the Government's requirements.<br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Fisher Scientific. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd via email ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 94074 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN March 5, 2011. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which the Defense Distribution Center, New Cumberland, PA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) for the Psion Teklogix handheld computer battery 7535 1900 MAH LI-ION. The Psion Teklogix batteries are to replace the current batteries that have exceeded their charge cycle and are not performing at optimal levels of standard.
<p>Psion Teklogix is the only source that can provide these services to the current system operating in our DDC Depots. This current system is from Psion Teklogix and is a standard across DDC depots. No other vendors are authorized by Psion Teklogix to provide the items pertinent to this requirement. Any attempt to develop an alternate source to provide this service, if possible, would result in a substantial cost to the Government. Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order (FFP) utilizing FAR Part 13 to Psion Teklogix for the 7535 handheld battery.</p>
<p>Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The required delivery of this procurement is 45 days from the date of award.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334112 with an employee standard of 1000.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to provide the 7535 Battery by 3:00 PM EDT, Friday March 4, 2011 to Joshua Bell, Acquisition Operations, DDC J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone: 717-770-6081, FAX: 717-770-7591, or e-mail: Joshua.bell@dla.mil for consideration by the agency. If no affirmative responses are received by 3:00 PM EDT, Friday March 4, 2011 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated and awarded to Psion Teklogix.</p>

<p>CAUTION NOTICE: CLAUSE 52.215-9023 REVERSE AUCTION (OCT 2009) DLAD is being included in the solicitation to permit the Contracting Officer to utilize this on-line reverse auctioning technique as a means of conducting price discussions if deemed advantageous to the government. Pricing should be submitted as in any other proposal; if determined advantageous, offerors will be notified of our intent to use Reverse Auctioning thereafter.

<p>CAUTION NOTICE -- TWO-PHASE TECHNICAL/PRICE EVALUATION (AUG 2007) DSCP<br />The Government anticipates that numerous offerors will submit proposals on solicitation. In the event that eight or more proposals are received, the Government may use a two-phase evaluation process, which allows the Contracting Officer to conduct a preliminary evaluation of all offers, in order to determine which offers are the least likely to be candidates for further consideration. During this preliminary evaluation, all offerors' Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) and proposed prices will be evaluated. Certain offerors may be excluded from further consideration at this point, if their PDM ratings and/or offered prices are not competitive when compared with PDM ratings and prices proposed by other offerors. The remaining offers will then be evaluated for the remaining technical evaluation factors. After the completion of this review, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to establish a competitive range and enter into negotiations, or to award without discussions. This process is set forth in provision 52.215-9P23, Two-Phase Technical/Price Evaluation (DPACS # M15E17) contained in solicitation.</p>

<RESPDATE>030411

<CONTACT>Donna Jenkins, 405-954-0693

<a href="mailto:donna.jenkins@faa.gov">donna.jenkins@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for a Contractor/Physician to furnish all necessary services to review, provide medical interpretation, record and formulate recommendations using current AAM-300 guidelines of ECGs. ECGs include, but are not limited to standard, 12-lead resting and exercise ECG's (treadmill, Holter monitoring, etc.). All ECGs assigned by the Contracting Officer (CO) or Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) will be made available to the physician through Airman Medical AMCD. ECG's may be reviewed via computer access in FAA ECG System, The Document Imaging and Workflow System (DIWS) and/or hardcopy. Consulting services are estimated to be approximately 1,500 ECGs per month and require the completion of assigned ECGs and cases.

The FAA contemplates awarding a requirements contract with one base year and two one-year option periods to fulfill this requirement.   The total estimated dollar value is $374,400.00.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 621111 Office of Physicians (except Mental Health Specialists) and the Small Business size standard is $xxx Million.
The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with William J. Fors, MD, Oklahoma City, OK, in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.
The rationale for single source is urgency, impact, and specialized experience.Urgency:  AAM-300 has recently lost its 2 Government ECG Technicians.  Under the current hiring freeze, CAMI is unable at this time to back fill these Government positions for an indefinite time period.  Dr. Fors is currently the only review source for all ECG's at every level of the medical certification process.  Impact: AAM-300 must maintain these critical services in support of the pilot medical certification.  The impacts of not establishing a sole source contract to these services effectively result in the following:  Violation of existing Federal Law and FAA orders; Jeopardize national and international aviation safety; adversely compromises the National Airspace System (NAS) by increasing the risk of aircraft accidents as a result of possible commercial pilot incapacitation due to medical issues. A lapse in services prevents the ongoing certification of pilots whose medical certification is reliant on the ECG review and recommendations of a cardiologist with expertise in aerospace medicine and cardiology.  Failure to maintain these services may result in pilots flying that are medically ineligible creating safety of flights risk unacceptable to the FAA or failure to allow eligible pilots from flying and the FAA will fail to meet its objectives outlined in the Flight Plan (2009-2019).
Specialized Experience: Dr. William J. Fors is the only known licensed Cardiologist in the Oklahoma City Metro area with the Aerospace Medicine expertise, the established qualification requirements able and willing to meet the performance requirements outlined in the statement of work including completion of the AME Basic Seminar, 24 hours of FAS panel requirements and knowledge of the FAA automation systems.  ACMD is located on the MMAC Campus in Oklahoma City, due to the nature of the sensitive not classified pilot medical records; the cardiologist mandates these services be provided in secure facilities currently provided in the CAMI building.  Dr. Fors has 40 plus years expertise as a licensed cardiologist and expert in the field of Cardiovascular medicine.  Dr. Fors retired from full-time private practice in 2007 enabling his continued work reviewing ECG's and providing independent recommendations on behalf of patients for Deaconess Hospital, OKC, OK and airmen seeking medical certification from  Aerospace Medical Certification Division (AMCD), OKC, OK.     
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  Any questions or inquiries resulting from this announcement shall be addressed to Donna Jenkins, Contracting Officer, at (405) 954-0693 or email donna.jenkins@faa.gov and must by submitted by 3:00 p.m. CST on 25 February 2011.
This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement to advance SERVIR-Africa beyond the installation of theinitial infrastructure and early development of the integrated platform and scienceapplications. The specific focus will be on enhancing the functionality and performanceof the SERVIR regional platform at RCMRD, capacity building and training, and developmentof national application priorities in response to the needs assessment results.NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from the Regional Center for the Mapping ofResources for Development (RCMRD) to further the expansion of the SERVIR system to EastAfrica.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:1. RCMRD is already partnering with NASA and USAID, and has been implementing this worksince its inception. An immediate start is necessary to avoid an interruption of activityand unrecoverable schedule and project implementation impacts.2. Funding was provided to NASA from USAID under a Participating Agency ProgramAgreement. USAID approved RCMRD for hosting and operating the SERVIR-Africa system, andsupports continuation of RCMRDs engagement.3. The initial infrastructure has been set-up at RCMRD with the installation of USAIDfunded equipment (hardware and software).4. RCMRD is a collaborator on NASAs ROSES 2007 SERVIR-Africa project. That project isnow in its final stages. Without RCMRDs involvement, the completion of the NASA ROSESproject could be negatively impacted. 5. SERVIR is a high-visibility project at NASA/MSFC, NASA/HQ and USAID.  It is also themodel in the Americas for the Global Earth Observation System of Systemsa multinationaleffort to build an earth observation system.  It is also a key implementation projectunder the Central American-United States Joint Accord signed by U.S. Secretary of StateColin Powell on June 7, 2001. This level of visibility further supports the need tocontinue engaging an institution such as RCMRD that is well recognized in the geospatialcommunity.6. South-South collaboration has been established between the Water Center for the HumidTropics of Latin America and the Caribbean (CATHALAC), which hosts and operates theSERVIR system in Mesoamerica, and RCMRD. This relationship provides yet further rationalefor engaging RCMRD; hence, NASA can continue to benefit from the technical interchangeand technology transfer that is already occurring between these two highly regardedinstitutions.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon March 5, 2011.

<DESC>DescriptionNASA/GRC has a requirement for continued support and guidance in the ongoing effort toprepare a plan for the development of a Nuclear Thermal Propulsion system.NASA/GRC intends to purchase this continued support from Renmar Enterprises, Inc., 1429Clyde Drive, Naperville, IL  60565-1309.  Dr. Samit Bhattacharyya, President of this firm, has been part of the initial team whichincludes the Department of Energy, other NASA Center personnel, and private industry. These previous studies and combined efforts of all will produce early designs based on asignificant existing database and would rely to a large extent on non-nuclear tests andfocused nuclear tests in order to minimize cost and maximize effectiveness.Dr. Bhattacharyya has previously provided us with program planning support for NASAsFission Surface Power effort.  His support and work in this area along with over twentyyears of experience with Nuclear Thermal Propulsion gives him a unique understanding andknowledge of the current studies related to our Agency.In his past position as Director of Research at the Argonne National Laboratory, Dr.Bhattacharyya was involved in the development of ceramic-metallic (cermet) fuels.  Heauthored a technical memorandum on NTP fuel options which included extensive references. He also held the position as Director of the Savannah River National Laboratory.  Thesecombined positions have given him much experience in a wide variety of areas related toNuclear Thermal Propulsion.Due to the background experience and initial work already started in the beginning stagesof support for the development of this system we would like to have Dr. Bhattacharyya andhis firm continue with the next phases.  To begin this process with any other vendorwould not be cost effective to the government both in time and money.The Government intends to acquire a commercial service item using FAR Part 12 and theSimplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13.

<DESC>RFI <br />NCEP Radar Mosaic Data
<p><br />CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS</p>
<p>U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Acquisition and Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, 325 Broadway, MC-3, Boulder, CO 80305-3328.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (DOC/NOAA/NWS/NCEP) is exploring options for obtaining real-time radar data for providing weather analysis, forecasts, and warnings for the protection of life and property across the United States and surrounding oceans. NCEP currently procures radar mosaic products through a contract for its Service Centers in Miami, FL, Norman, OK, Kansas City, MO, and in Washington D.C., respectively. Each of the four Centers requires mosaic imagery of radar data (e.g. 1km base reflectivity, 4km Vertically Integrated Liquid, and composite reflectivity - precipitation mode 4km) in addition to value-added mosaic radar imagery (e.g. 1km base reflectivity with quality control - clutter suppression, mosaic of mesocyclone/Hail-Index/Storm-Track-Information/Tornado-Vortex-Signatures products). These mosaics are created from the NWS/FAA/Military WSR-88D radars for Alaska, Hawaii and the continental U.S.</p>
<p>NCEP Centers prefer mosaic data from the multi-radar/multi-sensor systems available across the U.S. to include the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) systems. The NCEP Centers will need to display the mosaics and single site imagery/data in the software systems<br />National-Advanced Weather Information Systems (N-AWIPS) and Advanced Weather Information Systems-2 (AWIPS-2). In order for N-AWIPS and AWIPS-2 to display mosaics and single site imagery/data, the vendor solution should include a standard data transfer mechanism that can be used to move data from the vendor systems to N-AWIPS and AWIPS-2 at each individual Service Center. In addition, NCEP requires redundancy of single site imagery from the proposed vendor solution in order to continue providing single site radar data from the WSR-88Ds when the NOAAPORT dissemination system is not disseminating radar data.</p>
<p>The delivery method of the mosaic and single site data must be operationally robust and supported by the vendor via a 24-hour day customer support department to solve data acquisition, software and hardware problems with a 2-hour (support personnel) response time (i.e. remote). The solution must include a fully capable support staff providing responsive assistance to Government personnel in an event of data quality problems, data flow problems, or other questions about data formats, etc., that may arise. High dataflow uptime of 99.9% is required to ensure data is available during significant weather events such as land falling hurricanes and severe weather outbreaks. NCEP will consider providing physical access and reasonable space for equipment installation. In the event of a contractor system failure at a Government site, the vendor should be able to repair or replace the system quickly. If the primary data acquisition source is down (e.g. satellite ingest at a Government site), a backup data acquisition source shall be functional and available to activate immediately.</p>
<p>The vendor must be capable of providing a solution that complies with DOC and NOAA IT security guidance including the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002.</p>
<p>The DOC/NOAA/NWS/NCEP is seeking the following information:</p>
<p>1. Respondents shall describe a technical approach they would propose to successfully deliver the radar mosaic and single site imagery products to each of the NCEP's Service Centers.<br />2. Respondents shall indicate their capability for producing, delivering, and maintaining the flow of radar mosaic products that would satisfy NCEP's requirements.<br />3. Currently, NCEP procures radar mosaic and single site imagery products from a vendor under a firm-fixed price contract. Respondents shall describe a best value method under which NCEP can procure these radar mosaic products along with any commercial pre-printed price lists for the equipment, data, and services. <br />4. Respondents should indicate whether radar data mosaic products offered by the respondent meet the definition of commercial items or services as provided in FAR Part 2. <br />5. Respondents shall complete and submit Section 508 Vendor Checklist available at http://www.ago.noaa.gov/ago/acquisition/docs/vendorchecklist.pdf. <br />6. All assumptions and questions should be clearly stated in the RFI response.</p>
<p>Respondents shall not be obligated to provide the products described herein and it is understood by the United States Government that the cost estimates provided as a result of this request are "best" estimates and non-binding only.</p>
<p>All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary. The United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. The response to this RFI must be submitted by 3:00PM CT on February 28, 2011. No collect calls will be accepted.</p>
<p>All responses to this RFI shall be submitted via e-mail to Susan Labovitz, Contract Specialist, at <br />Susan.Labovitz@noaa.gov. Note: The phone number for the Contracting Specialist is (303) 497-7943 and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>

<a href="mailto:graham.k.oliff@us.army.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) has a requirement for RFIJ Systems.  The RFIJ system hardware simulates or replicates actual threat jamming waveforms of existing and emerging threat open air jamming systems which are available world-wide.  These jamming waveforms are targeted against United States (US) armed forces and their voice communications, data transmissions and Global Positioning System (GPS) signals.  Tentative delivery location is Redstone Arsenal, AL in Fiscal Year (FY) 2013-2014.<BR><BR>Acronym List:<BR>RJU - Remote Jamming Unit<BR>AGPSJ	 - Advanced GPS Jammer<BR>SUT - System Under Test<BR>CST - Control Signal Transmitter<BR>OAC - Open Air Capability<BR>FCC - Federal Communications Commission<BR>COMS - Communications<BR>HMMWV - High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle<BR><BR>RFIJ Systems have three major components comprising its key jamming functions.  They are as follows:<BR><BR>1.  Control Signal Transmitter (CST):  An electronics device that broadcasts signals (30 to 3000 MHz) that activate and direct both the RJU and AGPSJ injection jammer units attached to the SUTs scattered across the test range in use.  The CST is positioned on a test range just as live jamming assets would be; however, instead of broadcasting actual jamming waveforms, the device transmits (FCC allowed) un-restricted control tones.  These tones are received by the RJU and/or AGPSJ devices attached to the SUTs. These "injection jammers" then translate the control tones received into pre-programmed commands and commences insert or "inject" these pre-programmed threat waveforms into the SUT.  This is what is referred to as "Injection Jamming."  <BR><BR>2.  COMS Remote Jamming Unit (RJU):  A low power electronics package in a rugged metal case that simultaneously produces up to four separate threat representative jamming signals (30 to 3000 MHz) used against voice and data transmissions which the RJU inserts (or injects) into the SUT directly into the receiver circuitry.  This process mimics the effect of using a live, open-air jammer, but eliminates the unintended consequences (ex. jamming equipment that aren't part of the test event) associated with such live jamming into the atmosphere.<BR><BR>3.  Advanced GPS Jammer (AGPSJ):  Similar in size and function as the RJU; however, it concentrates on injecting various GPS threat jamming signals (1227.6 to 1575.42 MHz) which in turn denies, disrupts or distorts the true GPS signal location transmissions.  The distortion or the transmission of erroneous GPS signal data is commonly referred to as "Spoofing."<BR><BR>Both the RJU and AGPSJ housing use the same case.<BR><BR>In FY 2013 and continuing in FY 2014, the contemplated procurement will consist of:<BR><BR>1.  Five-Channel RJU Devices:  These units will contain both COMS and GPS injection jamming capabilities.  The operating parameters of these 5-channel units will match those of the previous injection jammers (30 - 3000 MHz).  It is anticipated that 290 devices will be procured.<BR><BR>2.  The second item to be procured during this timeframe will be the Low Power, All Weather, Remotely positioned, autonomously operating Control Signal Transmitter and Open Air Capability (CST-OAC) unit.  While the design will be true to the original CST capabilities (30 - 3000 MHz), this unit will have a much shorter operating range by using a lower powered (estimated 10 Watt instead of 50 Watt) amplifier.  These units will be capable of achieving one week of continuous operations and only require minimal servicing during that time.  Plans are to use a Harris RF-7800 or an Intuicom EB6 plus TAC radio (Government furnished) for remote control operations.  It is anticipated that 40 devices will be procured.<BR><BR>3.  Two-Channel (Man-Portable) RJU Device:  These units will contain COMS injection jamming capabilities and are designed to match with the JTRS SFF-B TAC Radio and its operating frequencies. This device will be installed in the Interceptor Body Armor Vest (Improved Outer Tactical Vest - IOTV) where it will replace one of the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPI) armor plates for testing during Operational Test events at a typical test range such as White Sands Missile Range.  It is anticipated that 220 devices will be procured.<BR><BR>It's the Government's intent to provide the complete "technical data package (TDP)" (drawings, files, firmware, etc.) for production.  The technical data package is not currently available for release; but, it will be made part of the formal solicitation. <BR><BR>RESPONSES REQUESTED:  Contractors desiring to be considered for this opportunity are requested to respond to the Contract Specialist listed below by 1600hrs on the closing date listed above.  Interested offerors shall provide the name of the company, business size, business type, other pertinent business characteristics, company location, brief synopsis of the relevant capabilities and experience, and a description of warranties that could be offered with the procured items.  For small businesses, interested offerors shall indicate how they will comply with FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, if this effort were to be totally or partially set aside for small business.<BR><BR>PEO STRI will be providing a full TDP in the RFP.  Details on what industry considers to be a full TDP shall also be provided with the company information.  For example, what are the names, types, quantities, drawings and formats of the documents that industry expects in a TDP.  <BR><BR>Submissions do not have a page limit restriction.<BR><BR>ADDITIONAL INFO:  Although subject to change, the anticipated North America Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this effort is 334220, Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing.<BR><BR>DISCLAIMER: This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Cody Cotten, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at cody.d.cotten@usace.army.mil.  FOR INFORMATION ONLY: FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Business Process. USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but are also the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned. Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization. Of those forty one, Fort Worth District (SWF) has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WT) facilities, Reception Station Barracks, Drill Sergeant Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The IDIQ contracts for Barracks are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) and Northeast ( CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion. The IDIQ contracts for Warehouses are located in East and West of the Mississippi River and have been distributed accordingly. <BR>SCOPE OF WORK: <BR>Central Issue Warehouses:  The primary mission of the CIFs is to provide a single point for receipt, storage, issue, exchange, and return of all authorized organizational clothing and individual equipment items at the specified United States Army Installation.  CIF facilities provide storage capabilities combined with office space, used in the administration of issuing soldiers equipment as needed.  The facilities support open storage for deployment functions as necessary by the Army Unit occupying the building.  The functional and operational requirements of the CIW require that the design be based on the characteristics of the material being handled and stored, the volume and flow pattern through the facility, and the inventory pattern.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.<BR>Support Supply Activity Warehouses: SSAs will provide a facility capable of storing and maintaining the Army prepositioned stocks (APS) and items required for active duty operation.  The facility is similar to a parts wholesale warehouse.  The functional and operational requirements of the SSA require that the design be based on the Adapt-Build Model standard design.    Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will not vary.<BR>General Purpose Warehouses: GPWs will be capable of supporting the storage of various equipment and materials, up to a Moderate-hazard level.  GPW facilities may have substantially differing design and operational requirements in order to meet the Armys needs on a worldwide basis.  The facility type will provide an acceptable relationship between actual equipment dimensions, performance characteristics and the building dimensions.  GPWs are intended to be similar both functionally and technically to private sector industrial warehouses.  Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; water, sewer, gas; paving, walks, curbs and gutters; storm drainage; site improvements and information systems.  Access for persons with disabilities will be provided in public areas.  Comprehensive building and furnishings related interior design services are required.  Comprehensive warehouse pallet and racking systems related to warehouse functional design services are required.  Air conditioning will be provided in administrative areas, and warehouse areas will be ventilated and heated.  Supporting work includes fire protection sprinkler and fire detection systems of the warehouses.  <BR>It is the intent of the Government to issue design-build and adapt-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region.<BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   <BR>This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:  Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  <BR>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 18 Oct 2010 under solicitation number W9126G-11-R-0053.  This procurement is Unrestricted.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 18 Nov 2010 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction).  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.<BR>MATOC: <BR>The Government intends to award at least two and up to five contracts as a result of this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a C-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be re-advertised as a full and open competition.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  THIS SOLICITATION IS SET-ASIDE FOR HUBZone.<BR>The total estimated contract capacity is $263,000,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 2,500.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.   The minimum task order limitation is $1,000,000.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $19,000,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $25,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to exceed the stated maximum task order limitation.  Task orders issued as a result of this contract will be firm-fixed price.  <BR>The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  There will be no public bid opening.  Proposals from Large businesses must comply with FAR Clause 52.219-9, regarding the requirement for a Subcontracting Plan.  The Fort Worth District goals (expressed as a percentage of the contractors total planned subcontract amount) are as follows:  Small Business 70.0%; Small Disadvantaged Business 6.2%; Women-Owned Small Business 7.0%; HUBZone Small Business 9.8%, Veteran-Owned Small Business 3.5%; and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business 2%.  Plans and specifications will not be provided in a hard paper copy.    Contractors may view and/or download this solicitation and all amendments from FedBizOps.<BR> Because of the size of our solicitations, you should not attempt to view them online.  Rather download them to your local hard drive and then open them.  Use of the FedBizOps website requires prior registration at https://www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<BR><BR>Request for Information:  W911QY-11-RFI-0001<BR><BR><BR>Identification of a Prophylactic Bioscavenger <BR>as a Nerve Agent Countermeasure <BR><BR><BR>SYNOPSIS:<BR><BR>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in Federal Acquisition Register (FAR) 15.201e.   This is not a solicitation or request for competitive proposals.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI.  Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.  (Note: this RFI is separate from the previously released Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Medical Countermeasures SSN, W911QY-10-S-0003.  Responses are requested regardless of whether a response to the previous SSN was submitted). <BR><BR><BR>BACKGROUND:<BR><BR>The Chemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS) Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS) Joint Project Management Office (JPMO) is responsible for the development, procurement, fielding, and sustaining of medical treatment and prophylactic capabilities against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear agents.  The current CBMS-MITS portfolio includes therapeutics, pretreatments and prophylactics at varying stages of clinical development, including FDA-approved drugs.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>PURPOSE  AND  OBJECTIVES:  <BR><BR>The Department of Defense (DoD) has a requirement for providing a prophylactic regimen that will protect the warfighter from incapacitation and death caused by organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents. The concept is to provide effective pre-exposure prophylaxis as appropriate to protect the force from a nerve agent attack and allow the force to complete its mission in a non-linear, dispersed battle space. A prophylactic that requires minimal or no medical intervention after exposure to nerve agents would represent a significant advance in protection of warfighters against lethal agents. Such a prophylactic would bind or degrade nerve agents before they inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme essential to normal nerve system function, and cause toxic effects.  The Bioscavenger program will pursue the development and of a suitable prophylactic candidate that will provide broad-spectrum protection against nerve agents, and work in concert with existing pretreatments and therapeutic countermeasures to offer optimal protection to the Warfighter.  To date, CBMS MITS has evaluated multiple candidates, and has determined human plasma derived butyrylcholinesterase (huBChE) to be its most promising candidate.  CBMS MITS has animal safety and efficacy study data and Phase 1 clinical human safety study data on multiple candidates.  The most promising candidates are at a Technology Readiness Level of 6.   <BR><BR>The objective of issuing this RFI is to gather information that will assist in the identification of a potential Bioscavenger candidate(s).  The DoD is interested in information pertaining to huBChE as a candidate, or any other possible candidate that meets or exceeds the capabilities demonstrated by huBChE.  As such, CBMS-MITS is seeking information on current industry capabilities from interested entities with potential to meet ANY of the following criteria,<BR>IN WHOLE OR IN PART:<BR><BR>(1)	Describe your company's candidate currently under development, to include general background information, pertinent research efforts, proposed indication(s) and proposed human dose and route of administration.  Specifically, identify the candidate's capabilities to fulfill the prophylactic requirement specified above, including information to support its ability to bind or degrade the nerve agent.<BR>  <BR>(2)	Provide a status of in vitro and/or animal model development (i.e., small animal species, large animal species, route of exposure).

<p><strong>CUSTOMER SERVICE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members of AmeriCorps are volunteers. The Corporation considers customer service very important. Our members typically serve one year which means that each year throughout the year members leave and new members begin service. This also means that each new member must complete an application with which they are unfamiliar and each new member chooses a child care provider that is not familiar with AmeriCorps, the applications and the requirements for verifying attendance of the child. Our members and the providers they choose will require patience and careful handling. Phone calls and emails from members, from providers, from sponsors and from family members will be frequent and the Corporation expects that they will be answered promptly, politely and thoroughly with information sufficient for the member or provider to understand what is required of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of this education can be achieved by a website that includes instructions and online applications, invoices, attendance sheets the data from which are captured in a database. The use of a fully automated system will reduce delays in communicating to members and providers information that is missing from the forms.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing a Sources Sought Announcement for a construction project for Ecosystem Restoration, Stewart's Creek, Barnstable, Massachusetts to determine the interest, availability, and capability of 8(a), HUBZone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned concerns to perform various construction activities as described below at Stewart's Creek. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990.  The estimated construction cost is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.  Work will begin in September 2011 and will extend over a 6-8 month period.  <BR><BR>The Stewart's Creek Estuary Restoration Project is located on Cape Cod in the town of Barnstable, Massachusetts.  The system is connected to Hyannis Harbor (Nantucket Sound) through a 50 foot-long, 3 foot-diameter concrete culvert that passes under Ocean Avenue.  The project involves restoring tidal flushing to the salt pond/marsh system by replacing the existing culvert under Ocean Avenue and restoring salt pond and salt marsh by excavating and redistributing sediment.  The existing culvert will be replaced with a 4-foot by 6-foot concrete culvert with headwalls and wingwalls.  The downstream side of the culvert will be equipped with a combination sluice gate, which has a flap valve to allow water to leave the upstream area as the tide recedes.  A sedimentation basin (a small depression) will be constructed at the upstream side of the culvert to capture sand transported into the marsh from the beach and an access ramp will be constructed to allow maintenance equipment to access the sedimentation basin.  Work on the culvert will be conducted with an open road cut between September and May.  Downstream flow must be pumped over Ocean Avenue during construction of the culvert.  The restoration area located upstream of the culvert is comprised of a stream fed pond; therefore, a water control plan is required for sediment removal and culvert replacement to be conducted.  Installation of the new culvert requires the relocation of an existing four inch diameter National Grid gas line and the relocation of an existing 12 inch diameter water line.  Gas line relocation work will be a joint effort between National Grid and the Contractor, with National Grid cutting and capping the old line and making the final connection to the new line.  To relocate the water main, the Contractor is required to secure the services of a Town of Hyannis qualified contractor.  There are also utility poles adjacent to the site which will have communication lines in place and operational during the prosecution of the work which shall not be disturbed by the Contractor.   A portion of the pond just north of Ocean Avenue will be dredged to a maximum depth of -1.0 foot NGVD29  removing approximately 3,300 cubic yards (c.y.) of material.  Salt marsh will be restored adjacent to the north side of this pond using the 3,300 c.y. of dredged material.  The excavated material will raise the existing elevations of the proposed marsh area to approximately 2.0 feet NGVD29.  A coir fiber roll will be placed around the perimeter of the excavated sediments (approximately 1.8 acres) to hold the material in place and the perimeter will be planted with salt marsh grasses to encourage them to colonize the restoration area.  <BR> <BR>Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following information:  small business size classification (i.e. 8(a), etc.) as well as qualifications and experience in performing the  work requirements stated above.  Please include specific examples of the firm's past experience with projects of similar scope and magnitude in terms of size and cost.  A bond is not required to be submitted at this time however, proof of ability to obtain bonding for 100% of the estimated project amount is required.  Responses are limited to twenty pages.  Responses are due March 14, 2011.  Responses should be addressed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, ATTN:  Ms.  Raushanah Muhammad.  Firms interested shall provide the above documentation in one original form and one copy. Please submit hard copies.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this market survey nor return the data provided. The results of this survey will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of this notice.  This is not a request to be placed on a solicitation mailing list nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers intends to solicit and award a construction project on Fort Drum, NY, during fiscal year 2011 (which ends 30 Sep 11) which will contain a Brand Name Only component. This project will be solicited competitively under a future solicitation.  This notification serves three purposes:  (1) to notify potential offerors of the Army's intent to solicit a brand name only component under a future construction project and (2) to identify potential sources of a compatible systems and (3) notification of the Army's intent to contract sole source for a Brand Name Only, system Stanley Wi-Q  Wireless Technology with heavy duty BEST electro-mechanical locksets, as described below.  The Stanley  Wi-Q  Wireless Technology with BEST  electro-mechanical locksets (the Stanley system) is embedded in the Construction projects.  The Stanley system is the only portion of the project identified to be procured from a sole source, if no sources are able to provide a compatible system. In the event no compatible equipment exists, the Brand Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source.  This synopsis is for planning purposes and is not a solicitation.  This synopsis is the only document that will be published notifying potential offerors of the government's intent.  <BR><BR>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT:  <BR><BR><BR>The specifications outlined in this document are designed to meet a need for Wireless Access Control Solution where the reader(s) is combined with the associated locking hardware to provide a battery powered wireless security access control solution to the door(s) or portal(s).  Any alternate approaches using hardwires solutions will not be acceptable.  The system shall be fully compatible with the Stanley Wi-Q  Technology Wireless Access Control Solution from Stanley and its kiosk which is the current backbone of the Ft Drum Installation keyless entry system.  The system shall consist of two major elements (Reader and Wireless) as described below.  <BR><BR>Reader -Lock<BR>This shall be a fully integrated smart locking device.  It shall have the capability to make all decisions at the device without relying on a separate controller device.  The reader/lock shall be installed within the existing door ANSI cut out and require minimal drilling.  There shall be no need to rout out the door to drive additional power through any electric transfer hinge.  All requirements will be met within the reader/ lock itself.  In no event shall a wired alternate solution be presented.  The wireless reader shall use an AA battery pack; no AC power shall be required at the door.  The reader/ lock shall also be able to operate as a fully stand alone intelligent device making all decisions in real time.  In the un-likely event that the reader/ lock is offline from the host , it shall continue to operate storing and recording accesses until it is reconnected and back on-line to the host.  The wireless reader/ lock shall be offered in one of four modes: as a self-contained cylindrical reader/ lock; as a supplemental quick adapter module to be added to an existing lockset for fire exit devices; as a retrofit kit to be mounted in a double gang box ad an upgrade path for a legacy hardwired application to make it wireless; and as a wireless access controller interfaced to a hardwired reader and ancillary door devices such as a Request to Exit switch, a Door Switch Monitor and a Door Lock sense input. For cylindrical lock applications the wireless reader shall provide support for an integral Request to Exit (RQE) and Door Switch Monitor (DS), Door Latch Position (LS), and Key Over-ride Sensor (KOS).  The reader/ lock shall support as a minimum the following "reader" technologies: up to a 6-digit user defined PIN number between 3 and 6 characters in length; user defined magnetic Stripe formats on either track 2 or track 3 on the Magnetic Stripe tracks at standard bit coding 2750-4000; support for 125 KHz HID/ Wiegand compatible Proximity cards with variable bit formats such that multiple user defined bit formats can be supported at the reader. Additionally: as standard, the reader shall support exterior applications; each reader/ lock shall have a battery power to meet 100,000 lock/ transaction; each reader/ lock shall come with a minimum 2,000 ID capacity, and be able to store locally, id offline, up to 20,000 transactions.<BR><BR>Reader-Lock Database<BR>The reader shall support 2,000 unique ID's in its standard configuration and be expandable to 65,000.  Expansion shall not require a field upgrade at the reader but rather a software key shall be downloaded from the host that shall increase the database size and support up to 65,000 cardholders.  Up to 144 user-defined time zones supported with 6 time intervals per time zone. Up to 32 types of unique user defined holidays shall be supported.  Each holiday shall be capable of supporting a different time code. A unique set of Access privileges shall be available for each cardholder per reader/ lock. The memory allocation on the reader/ lock shall be dynamic such that the user may maximize the size of the available memory to meet their requirements for either ID's or transaction storage. Time zones shall be able to cross midnight such that a shift beginning at 10:00 PM and ending at 9:00 AM the next morning will be considered as a signal time zone.  The reader/ lock shall be able to support an auto-enroll mode where the user may select a reader to be used to enroll a large group of cardholders.  This shall be achieved by either bulk loading of ID numbers between specific ranges or by presenting a card to a reader that then reads the card data and enrolls the card to the database.  The wireless reader/ locks shall at a minimum meet FCC Part 15C, UL10C, and ULCS104.<BR><BR>Reader - Lock Operation Modes<BR>The reader shall support Access Control for a single door with in reader and free egress on the same door.  The reader will monitor a door position status such that it is able to detect door open and door locked and secure.  In no event will a separate contact be required to be mounted to the frame of the door and wired back to a separate contact monitoring device.  All alarm monitoring at the door/ portal will be monitored by the reader/ lock itself and shall not require any additional controller support.  The reader shall report any access transaction with the time and date of the event in hours, minutes, and seconds. The reader/ locks database shall support up to 7 unique shunt times for specific groups of individuals and meet ADA compatibility requirements for extended shunt times for any single groups of physically impaired cardholders.  The reader will support an RQE (Request to Exit) status that will be reported separately as a separate auditable transaction.  In the event that an attempt to exit is made, but the door/ portal remains closed (secure), then the transaction will not be recorded as a valid RQE and will time out after the shunt has expired.  The reader/ lock shall support and transmit a signal if the power to the reader/ lock drops below 10%.  The reader shall support different operation modes based on time zones.  Thus a reader may be in a Card only mode in the daytime, but require a Card plus PIN after hours.  This shall be fully programmable from the host. The reader/ lock shall be able to operate in a fully stand alone mode or as a distributed fully intelligent reader/ lock holding the transactions until they are polled. The reader/ lock shall communicate via spread spectrum radio transmission at 2.4GHZ. The reader/lock shall use as a standard, AES 128 bit encryption to the nearest non-dedicated Portal Gateway.  Portal Gateways shall provide redundant communications capability so that a wireless reader can report to another Portal Gateway if its primary reporting path is lost.  The reader/ lock shall report multiple incorrect PIN attempts (greater than 3) as an alarm attempt.  The reader/ lock shall be able to detect the presence of a cardholder planning to gain access, prior to the formal card presentation, such that the cardholder shall not be required to orient their card in a specific manner to wake the reader.  The readers read/ response time to an access request shall not exceed 250 Milliseconds worse case.  Each reader/ lock shall have its own unique MAC address. <BR><BR>Wireless - Access Controller  <BR>A wireless access controller shall serve as a retrofit kit to replace an existing wired infrastructure with a local wireless reader PCB that has the ability to slave to a wired reader and local peripherals at the door.  It is also capable of interfacing with a token reader utilizing a standard Wiegand protocol to unlock various electrified locking hardware such as electric strikes, exit device trim, electro-magnetic locks and other low voltage applications.  This shall include the following: support of an existing (RQE) Request to Exit device, (DS) Door Switch Monitor (magnetic contact etc.) and (LS) Door latch sense; it shall also support a locally powered locking device rated up to 4AMPS at 12/24 V DC; an auxiliary relay output will be available to drive other door related outputs, this relay shall be rated at 2 AMPS 12/24 V DC; there shall additionally be support for other non door related auxiliary inputs that may be user configured to monitor other digital inputs; the wireless access controller will also have the same feature set of software capabilities as the standard wireless reader, up to 65,000 ID's, 144 time zones, variable shunt times for different staff groups, and ADA compliance; the wireless access controller will be able to support any Wiegand card format form 16 to 128 bits and shall be able to serve as a log on or enrollment reader where an individual or group of individuals may "badge" into the system and the system will identify their card data so the card can be auto-enrolled; the wireless access controller shall provide wireless communication back to a Portal Gateway such that no separate controllers will be required for decision making, all door related decisions will be made at the wireless access controller local reader(s) it serves; all terminations to the wireless access controller shall be through plug or wired block terminals- no special tools will be required to install the unit(s); the reader shall be able to operate in different modes such that it is able to serve as a smart I/O module supporting I/O functions either ancillary to its primary role as an access control device or as its sole role.  In this mode the wireless access controller shall be able to provide the following: 1) As a wireless reader module with support for a dedicated Door Switch Monitor (DS), Door Latch Sensor (LS), Request to Exit (RQE), and key by pass override with two onboard relays, one rated at 4 AMP for 12/24 V DC operation, the other at 2 AMP for 12/24 DC operation plus 4 additional logic driven outputs.  In this mode no wireless reader would be supported.  2) The reader shall be available, in retrofit mode as a wireless access controller, and shall be able to support two Wiegand compatible readers.  This support shall allow a wireless access controller.  The access (ingress and egress transactions shall be recorded separately and from part of an audit trail.  3) The Wireless Access Controller shall come standard with half wave dipole antennas and a ceiling mount omni-directional antenna with 20' of cable and all required connectors.<BR><BR>Wireless - Portals and Gateways<BR>The portal gateways shall operate in a non-dedicated mode such that any reader/ lock shall be able to report to and through any portal gateway.  The portal gateway shall accept data from any of the addresses readers and transmit bi-directional encrypted data to the host for archiving and data management.  Each portal gateway shall have the following capabilities: each portal gateway, in base configuration shall support a minimum of 16 reader/ locks in its antenna range and via system options, be able to support up to 128 reader/ locks in a maximum system configuration; each portal gateway shall have its own unique MAC address such that, on boot up, the host will identify those portal gateways that belong to the system; every portal gateway shall encrypt the data using 128 BIT AES encryption and send and receive data via spread spectrum RF transmission to and from the host; nominal transmission distances between the reader/ locks and the portal gateway(s) shall have 250 feet line of sight; extended ranges exceeding 1,000 feet shall be available, if required, using standard commercially available high security RF transport sub-systems; each portal gateway shall have the support of a stand-by power supply; each portal gateway shall support two transmission paths to the host, the user may elect to use standard Ethernet cabling between the portal gateway and the host using a cross over cable; each portal gateway shall have the capability to support additional I/O devices through two auxiliary, non-dedicated serial ports and one USB port, these ports shall be designed for OEM applications and shall not be for general purpose I/O; each portal shall have its own IP address, this may be static or dynamic; the portal gateway shall support secure socket communications between the host(s)/ server and any associated portal gateway this shall be user selectable; and the portal gateway shall come standard with half wave dipole antennas and a ceiling mount omni-directional antenna with a 20' cable and all required connections.<BR><BR>All interested businesses should notify this office in writing by mail or fax by 4 March, 2011, 10:00am local time.

Your response to this notice must be received, in writing, on or before 4:00PM (local time) on March 04, 2011.<BR><BR>Scope of work is as follows:<BR><BR>The primary goal of the project is to create woody riparian habitat along the Lower Snake River.  Skookum HMU is located in Lower Monumental Pool on the right bank at river mile 47-50.  The HMU has an existing irrigation system which includes an in-river intake/pump with irrigation pipes.  The project would expand the existing system by constructing a new system upstream between the cattle corridors. After the irrigation is expanded, the site would be planted with shrubs and trees in separate contract.<BR>The conceptual layout is to irrigate 5 swales along the river between the cattle corridors.  The length is approximately 3,800 feet and up to 300' up slope from the river.  The project will provide an estimated 40 acres of riparian and 75 acres of shrub steppe habitat. <BR> <BR>The contractor will be responsible for replacing the existing diesel pump with a new electric pump and connecting the pump to the new electrical service.  Electrical power will be brought across the river and near to the site in a separate contract.  The amount and type of work for the power hook up is partially subject to where the electrical lines cross the river and where the sprinklers are to be placed.<BR><BR>The existing intake is in the process of being inspected to determine if the contractor will be required to repair or replace it. <BR> <BR>Contractor access would be from the river.  All material, equipment and labor would be brought in by barge.  It is assumed that there will be minimal effort in preparing the shore for river access. <BR> <BR>The estimated quantities below are for installing the new irrigation system.  These estimates are for informational purposes only.  The contractor will be responsible for verifying quantities in the solicitation package.   The backfill quantity is a conservative estimate in that this assumes all backfill and bedding material will be imported to the site and that any excess excavated material will not be removed from the site but be wasted on site.  An evaluation is underway to determine if the existing materials are suitable for bedding.  It is very possible that some of the excavated material will be used as backfill.<BR><BR>It is assumed that access to the existing inlet for removal and replacement can be accomplished from the shore.  An excavator could be used to lift the old inlet and to place the new inlet.  Depending on the distance from the shore and the current depth of the inlet, a working barge may be required and possibly even divers.  The new inlet is assumed at this point to be similar to the T1000 inlet from Pump-Rite Screens (www.pump-rite.com) or equal.<BR>  <BR>Quantities<BR><BR>	Length (ft)	Excavation (BCY)	Pipe (LF)	Backfill (LCY)<BR>2.5" Pipe 4,800 ft.	1,200 BCY	        4,800 LF	1,440 LCY<BR>4" Pipe	  1,110	ft.     278   BCY	        1,110 LF	333   LCY<BR>6" Pipe	  1,111	ft.     356   BCY 	        1,111 LF	444   LCY<BR>8" Pipe	  1,824	ft.     803   BCY 	        1,824 LF	1,003 LCY<BR>10" Pipe  520   ft. 	229   BCY	        520   LF        286   LCY<BR>Total                   2,864 BCY 	        9,365 LF	3,507 LCY<BR><BR>				<BR>	Excavation (BCY)	Gravel Base (CY)	Concrete (CY)	<BR>Pump Pad	3.0 BCY 	1.5 CY          	1.2 CY	<BR><BR>Typical equipment that will be used on-site will be a small backhoe for excavation, a small front-end loader for unloading and hauling material, and a walk-behind compactor.<BR><BR>Contractor is required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, which can be found online at http://www.usace.army.mil/CESO/Pages/EM385-1-1,2008NEW!.aspx located at US Army Corps of Engineers homepage.<BR>

<p>Total number of spare CPP systems in Coast Guard supply System: none<br /><br />Location of Juniper class buoy tenders: 4 Alaska, 2 Hawaii, 1 Guam, 1 Gulf of Mexico, 2 Great Lakes, 4 East Coast.</p>
<p>OVERHAUL DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Each CPP shall be overhauled in accordance with a detailed specification mandating use of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Standards, Processes, Procedures and OEM-certified new or requalilfied/rebuilt parts/assemblies. The overhaul will include, but not be limited to the following sequential steps:</p>
<p>a. Performing a full equipment inventory to ensure completeness of unit<br />b. Cleaning the CPP system in preparation for disassembly<br />c. Disassembling the CPP to component level, performing further cleaning and NDT, measuring and recording dimensional attributes, propeller condition, validating configuration, assessing condition of beveled gear sets and submitting a detailed Pre-Overhaul Inspection Report that includes overhaul recommendations, labor/material/parts costs, and estimated overhaul completion level.<br />d. Overhauling/replacing components/assemblies as authorized by the Coast Guard<br />e. Reassembling the CPP and submit a Post Overhaul Inspection Report<br />f. Performing an acceptance test and completing a final inspection jointly with a Coast Guard QA representative<br />g. Preserving, packaging, packing, and marking the CPP in preparation for shipment</p>
<p>ENGINEERING AND SYSTEM MODIFICATION DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>a. As required by the Coast Guard, engineer and completely develop modifications to improve the system's reliability and/or performance. Plans for these CPP modifications shall include detailed drawings, technical publication changes, required maintenance changes and any other technical documentation that may be requested for delivery from the Coast Guard. Some examples of other documents are test plans and installation specifications. <br />b. System modifications shall be performed either on spare parts in Coast Guard inventory or on new OEM certified parts for installation at a later date. Some modifications may be required to be performed locally either in a shipyard or at the Cutter's home pier.<br />c. All manufactured or modified parts shall be OEM certified<br /><br />Note: One anticipated mod concerns blade seals whose current failure rate is requiring annual drydockings (vice schedule quadrennial drydockings). A second anticipated mod concerns OD boxes and oil tubes, and possible replacement of existing OEM components with new OEM components.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT:<br /><br />a. As required, and both remotely or onsite, provide OEM engineering analysis and consultation for CPP maintenance and casualty repair. <br />b. As required, provide OEM field engineering support to oversee installation of overhauled and modified CPP systems or CPP components aboard Coast Guard buoy tenders.<br />c. Provide continuous stream of OEM-generated technical recommendations regarding upgrades, part substitutions, maintenance practices and processes. Notify the Coast Guard of long lead-time part concerns.<br />d. As required, provide OEM-certified new or requalified/rebuilt parts/assemblies to SFLC IBCT on buoy tenders in their homeport or while deployed.<br />e. As required, assemble complete overhaul or modification kits and ship to each cutter for installation.<br /><br />TRAINING SUPPORT FOR COAST GUARD ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS:<br /><br />a. As required, and both remotely and onsite, provide OEM-qualified maintenance, operational and diagnostic training to shore and vessel based Coast Guard units.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED QUANTITIES:<br /><br />a. The number of OEM technical representative onsite visits to support and oversee CPP maintenance is roughly five (5) per year. The number of OEM technical representative onsite visits to support engineering analysis and consultation for CPP casualty repair is roughly five (5) per year. The number of OEM technical representative onsite visits to support training requirements is four (4) per year.<br />b. The Coast Guard projects a requirement to modify a total of four (4) CPP Systems each year to solve a known weakness within the OD box and to reduce the amount of leakage. This estimate is based on the assumption that the modifications would need to be performed while each cutter is out of the water and the fact that the Coast Guard currently dry-docks 4 Juniper class buoy tenders each year. <br /><br />EXPECTED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:<br /><br />a. SFLC anticipates CPP overhaul and technical support needs will be incorporated into a firm fixed-price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity delivery order contract with a base contract year and four (4) contract option years.<br /><br />TECHNICAL AND LICENSING BARRIERS/LIMITS:<br /><br />The Coast Guard was unable to obtain, and/or the systems manufacturers were unwilling to furnish, complete detailed technical &amp; engineering data specific to the Bird Johnson Model 102 and Rolls-Royce Naval Marine Model 110251007 CPP Systems during the acquisition phase of the 225' WLB platform program. Xonsequently, critical dimensional and tolerance information remains proprietary to Rolls-Royce, the current OEM. This has precluded the Coast Guard from promoting alternative overhaul, maintenance and engineering sources or even developing organic repair capabilities within the fleet maintenance network. As such, the Coast Guard believes that only Rolls-Royce can satisfy this requirement. However, alternate sources believing they possess the necessary expertise, technical data, resources, and capabilities to meet the Coast Guard's specific CPP technical support requirements outlined above are encouraged to submit statements of capability for review/consideration. <br /><br />STATEMENT OF CAPABILITY FORMAT AND CONTENT:<br /><br />Responses from both large and small businesses are considered at this time.<br /><br />Address your ability to provide OEM support as addressed in the above paragraphs. Provide information concerning any licensing rights you possess on the listed equipment or with regard to OEM technical and logistical support.<br /><br />Provide references to equivalent type of work performed in the past five (5) years (provide customer contract number, company or POC name and phone number.)<br /><br />Indicate your company business size and status (i.e. 8(a), SDVOSB, etc.).<br /><br />Capability Statement limit is five (5) pages. Send electronically to Jim Altice at james.s.altice@uscg.mil. All Capability Statements shall be received at this address no later than 12:00 p.m. (EST) on 18 March 2011 and shall reference HSCG85-11-R-WLBCPP on both the email subject line and on the submitted documents. Information and materials submitted in response to this request will not be returned. Classified material shall not be submitted.</p>

<DESC>Market Research for Marine Corps Assault Amphibious Vehicle Systems (AAVS) Sustainment, Survivability, and Future Enhancement Upgrades: Request for Information Marine Corps Assault Amphibious Vehicle Systems (AAVS) Program. 

Message to Industry:  The Marine Corps will be taking a collaborative approach with industry in order to produce a more affordable amphibious capability.  Interested partners should look at the Marine Corps amphibious requirements for an Amphibious Combat Vehicle, Marine Personnel Carrier and AAV legacy upgrades as discussed in this and the other amphibious RFIs as a Family of Systems.   The Marine Corps would like to see industry focus on affordability by designing/proposing solutions that will reduce the operational and support costs over the life cycle and consider such things as commonality, modularity of proposed solutions and interoperability among Systems of Systems.
  These solutions should take into consideration emerging technologies and provide for growth over the next 15 years. Additionally, the Marine Corps is interested in hearing from industry strategies they would use to lower their procurement costs for their proposed solutions.

As announced in the January 7th 2011 Special Notice to industry, the Marine Corps is planning both interim and long term strategies for its amphibious capability. This includes potential upgrades to the AAV program. This is a follow-up Request for Information (RFI) that expands upon the RFI as originally posted on 18 August 2010 via a Sources Sought Synopsis related to the Marine Corps AAVS.  There currently is no Request for Proposal (RFP) under development, and no RFP is available.
  

Marine Corps Systems Command continues to seek information from potential responsible sources capable of performing AAVS sustainment and survivability upgrades in support of the AAVS fleet, as this requirement remains unchanged. In addition to the AAVS sustainment and survivability upgrades, the Marine Corps is now exploring the possibility of further enhancements to a portion of the AAVS fleet.  

The purpose of this expanded RFI is to conduct market research / market survey that will identify potential sources, capabilities, and interest in the program, and assist in developing an acquisition strategy to meet Government requirements. The scope of work that is the focus of this expanded RFI now includes enhancements to the Command, Control and Communications (C3), lethality systems, propulsion system, litter mounting-medical evacuation, habitability, and water mobility.
  Market research for both requirements is being conducted concurrently. 

Program Background:  The Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) Model 7A1 (AAV7A1) Family of Vehicles (FOV) serves as the Marine Corps' primary amphibious lift and armored personnel carrier.  It consists of three variants - a personnel carrier (AAVP7A1), a command and control variant (AAVC7A1), and a recovery variant (AAVR7A1) - that were originally developed in the 1960s and began fielding in 1972.  All three variants are fully tracked, armored platforms capable of conducting amphibious landings in accordance with Joint Doctrine for Amphibious Operations JP 3-02.  The AAV7A1 FOV is currently the primary means of delivering the initial infantry of the surface assault element for forcible entry operations during amphibious operations.
  There are currently 930 AAVP7A1s, 76 AAVC7A1s, and 51 AAVR7A1s, for a total of 1,057 vehicles.  The overall objectives of the Sustainment and Survivability Upgrade are to maintain the operational effectiveness of the AAV7A1 FOV fleet until replaced. Request industry provide solutions that can support fielding beginning in 2017. This expanded RFI addresses the additional enhancements being considered for a portion of the AAVS fleet detailed below, and are in bold print to emphasize the area of interest that is now expanded. 

 Potential Scope of Work may include the following:

The Marine Corps has a potential requirement for a contractor to provide AAVS Sustainment and Survivability Upgrade for the AAV7A1 FOV, and additional future enhancements as described below.
  The Contractor would be responsible for providing AAVS sustainment and upgrade solutions under the management of the Program Manager, Assault Amphibious Vehicle Systems (PM AAVS) at the Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Quantico, Virginia, and various other locations as necessary. Other locations may include CONUS or OCONUS, and at the contractors own facilities. Information under numbers 1 through 6, and 7(a) through (d) were part of the original RFI. Items 7 (e), (f), (g), (h), (i) and (j) are added under this revision, and are the subject of the expanded RFI.  
.  
 
The contractor would be tasked with potentially providing some or all of the following services/supplies:
1.	Program Management Support:  Includes participation in Government directed development of price and availability of upgrade components;  internal project management and associated accounting using the Earned Value Management System, scheduling, document preparation and on-site representation at Government or contractor facilities, as directed.
 
2.

<CONTACT>See POC in Sources Sought Notice.
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice seeking information from potential sources that have the interest and capability to support the Improvised Explosive Device Detector Dog  (IDD) effort for the United States Marine Corps.  This is only a Sources Sought notice, and there currently is no Request for Proposal (RFP) available.  

The Marine Corps Systems Command has a potential requirement to provide long-term training, sustainment and maintenance for the IDD effort.  The requirement will include kenneling, training, physical conditioning, transporting, and re-training of approximately 647 dogs throughout the deployment/sustainment lifecycle.  The only dogs utilized for the purposes of this effort are purebred Labrador retrievers.
  All training shall be conducted and performed in accordance with the USMC prescribed procedures.  Below is a description of the potential requirement. 

IDD Sustainment/Kenneling:   The contractor will be responsible for the full range of actions necessary to sustain the IDDs when not in the direct care of the Marine Corps.  This includes, but is not limited to kenneling facilities, food, water, shelter, transportation for training, physical conditioning, basic obedience skills, and continued training and handling to ensure that the dogs retain the skills necessary for the mission.  Kenneling facilities must be located CONUS and meet the Department of Defense kennel standards, with minimum kennel size of 8x4, not including dog house.
  The anticipated workload is approximately 50%/50% East Coast/West Coast for the purposes of units that will be receiving the IDDs and associated training, travel and support.  Coordination with DoD veterinarians will be necessary for the healthcare of active IDDs.  It is anticipated that the contractor will not be responsible for sustaining/kenneling all 647 dogs at the same time due to deployments and training requirements.  Although the actual quantity will vary, the current level of sustainment/kenneling is projected to be 364 dogs (while 283 are deployed).  The contractor will be responsible for providing deployment kits that include all of the materials necessary to sustain the IDD while deployed (deployment kennel, food, leash, collar, first aid kits, etc).
 

IDD Training: All training shall be conducted and performed in accordance with the USMC prescribed training procedures.   The contractor shall be responsible for initial and sustainment training for IDDs in the manner of comprehensive off-leash explosive detection training dogs.  Sustainment training will be required throughout the sustainment/kenneling requirement as described above.  The contractor may be responsible for procuring additional IDDs and providing initial training to new dogs not currently part of the IDD effort as part of the replacement cycle as dogs are retired from the Military Working Dog (MWD) program.  

IDD Handler/Unit Training: Training for deploying units for IDD handling will be required and includes several different kinds of training.
  Primary training includes initial Handler Training which is provided to designated USMC personnel.  This includes class sizes of up to forty (40) students taught twenty times/year, and consists of Primary Handlers, Alternate Handlers, and a Kennel Supervisor.  These classes are conducted at the contractors facility.  The Kennel Supervisor will have additional training to ensure that their capabilities are able to support the long-term sustainment and care of the dogs when not in the direct care of the contractor.   Handler Training Instructor/IDD Team ratio is currently one (1) Instructor per three (3) IDD Teams.  An IDD Team consists of an IDD and a Handler.  Current requirement is for a class lasting not longer than five (5) weeks.
  Additional training includes Refresher Team Training for up to five (5) days and Additional Team Training, as required, for up to ten (10) days at the units home location (CONUS).  

Transportation: Full transportation logistics will be required to transport the IDDs to various locations within CONUS.  Potential locations where the IDDs will need to be transported by the contractor include Yuma, AZ,  Twenty-Nine Palms, CA, Camp Pendleton, CA,  Camp Lejeune, CA,  Riverside, CA, Cherry Point, NC and other locations as required by the Government.  Included in transportation is the delivery of IDDs to their point of deployment and recovery from units returning from deployment to the contractors sustainment location.

Field Service Representatives (FSRs): Field Service Representatives will be required to provide unit support Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) for a 210 day deployment.
  FSRs for OCONUS support will accompany deployed units, submit status reports and training reports, and provide training assistance to support the IDDs while they are deployed.  Personnel selected as FSRs currently must be able to obtain and retain a Secret clearance level.  It is anticipated that up to twenty (20) FSRs will be required to deploy with the units.  A FSR will be identified and attached to a unit beginning at initial handler training and last throughout the pre-deployment training cycle, deployment overseas, and return to CONUS.  Throughout the training/deployment cycle, the FSR will provide support to the unit in the way of continued training/reinforcement for the IDD team, and provide feedback/reporting on the status of the deployed IDDs.

Period of Performance:  The anticipated period of performance is up to three years.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management (CFM) is seeking small business general construction firms to perform capital asset improvements at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA. The general construction firms must be classified under one or more of the following small business programs: (1) Service-Disabled Veterans-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) (2), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), (3) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), (4) Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), (5) Section 8(a), and/or (6) HUBZone.  The estimated price of this project is more than $100,000,000.  CFM is contemplating the use of an economic price adjustment (EPA) clause under FAR 16 for steel products.  Interested general construction firms must be firms with an approved NAICS Code 236220. The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.   A bid bond as well as payment and performance bonds shall be required. 

This capital asset improvements at VA Palo Alto Health Care System project will consist of the construction of a three-story, approximately 174,000 GSF Polytrauma/Blind Rehabilitation Center and associated site utilities; the demolition of approximately 64,000 GSF of seismic exceptionally high risk two-story Building 48 and two-story Building 2 Wing C and associated site utilities; and the construction of a four-story, approximately 210,000 GSF, cast-in-place, 600-Car Parking Structure.  

A single prime contractor is being sought for multiple construction projects in order to enhance coordination, reduce construction traffic and staging areas, take advantage of economies of scale, and to minimize disruptions to the medical center. Due to the ongoing construction activities at the VA Palo Alto medical center, there are many general contractors at the site and off-site parking and shuttle services are required for medical center staff due to the lack of parking spaces at the facility. 

At this time, no solicitation exists, therefore, do not request a solicitation.  Only small bondable business contractors having the skills and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought. Responses should include the following information: 1. Company Name, 2. Address, 3. Point of Contact, 4. Phone number and e-mail address, 5. Business size determination and qualifying Small Business status, 6. Certification of Small business Status and Duns Number , 7. Available bonding capacity surety letter, 8. Provide construction experience of similar projects in size and complexity.  Please provide your email responses to frank.clemons@va.gov addressing all the above items no later than 1:00 pm EST on March 1, 2011.  Fax responses are acceptable at 202.565.4595.  Small business concerns failing to respond to this ad will not be precluded from responding to the solicitation. 

Note: This is not a Request for Proposal (RPF) and the Government is seeking information for market research purposes only.  The Government may or may not issue RFP for this project.

Note: If this project is solicited as full and open competition and in order to mitigate adverse effects to the small business community, prospective large prime contractors will be required to submit a small business sub-contracting plan as part of their bids. The ability to meet and exceed small business goals will be incorporated into the source selection criteria and weighted at a high level of importance.  In addition, prospective large prime contractors will be encouraged to enter into small business teaming agreements. Prospective large prime contractors will be required to obtain bids from small businesses and to subcontract under separate Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) for the 600-Car Parking Structure and the Demolition of Building 48 and Building 2 Wing C.  SDVOSB subcontractors would be rated highest. The solicitation will contain the requirement and evaluation factors that will be used for selection.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) is performing a market survey for the purpose of gathering information pertaining to industrys capability in the field of countering Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The purpose of this exercise is to obtain a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) price indication of Remotely Controlled Vehicles (RCVs) for future requirements in the forthcoming months.

Please provide your input to NC3A no later than 25 February 2011.  NC3As point of contact for this exercise is Rebecca Benson, Senior Contracting Officer. Ms. Benson may be reached via email: Rebecca.Benson@nc3a.nato.int OR via phone: +32-(0)-2-707-8328.

NC3A is interested in RCVs for use in operations countering IEDs. There are two main application areas in which NC3A may have requirements: 1) IED Detection and Neutralization during Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) operations and 2) Route Clearance Activities.

The equipment will be used by military staff from the NATO nations during operations in peace and wartime, under a broad range of climatic conditions. The equipment shall provide the operating forces with the capability to investigate, manipulate, and disrupt suspected IEDs in a variety of situations and environments, using the RCV with equipment payload.

The requirements are fairly wide, with the intention of guiding the companys choice of products to offer so as to provide NC3A with a set of options for RCVs and payloads for use against IEDs in the application areas of interest.

Such acquisition, which is envisioned to be conducted on the basis of a competitive exercise, remains subject to the formal approval of the competent NATO authorities, which at this junction has not been granted.  At this stage, therefore, NC3A cannot guarantee that such a competitive exercise will be carried out, and it reserves the right to pursue other acquisition avenues at its disposal.

To this extent it shall be noted that should a competitive exercise be pursued for the purpose of the procurement of the RCVs, it shall be conducted in such a way as to not limit or otherwise render unfeasible the adoptions or specific solutions to the disadvantage of companies that have not participated in this survey.

Any response to this request is to be provided purely on a voluntary basis, and the determination not to provide feedback shall not constitute grounds for the exclusion of companies from any form of competitive exercise to be conducted in the future. Furthermore, NC3A shall not recognize any compensation, regardless of its nature, for activities performed in conjunction with the present request.

The present request and any information provided, including but not limited to pricing, quantities, capabilities, functionalities, and requirements are not to be construed as binding for NATO for future acquisitions of any RCVs.  Similarly, any information provided by the company in response to the present request shall be kept confidential, shall be disseminated to NATO personnel only and solely for purposes of the present exercise, and shall not be considered biding with regards to the future potential acquisition of the RCVs in question.

ROM Pricing and Data Submission Methodology

Methodology

Companies are requested to provide per unit price information. A number of questions must also be answered. The responses provided by companies will be treated as commercial-in-confidence, and will only be used for the purpose of defining a funding envelope for projects intending to procure such vehicles and not selecting a product. Product selection will be done through the procurement process.

Overview

NC3A is interested in RCVs for use in operations countering IEDs. There are two main application areas where NC3A may have requirements in the upcoming months: 1) IED Detection and Neutralization during EOD operations and 2) Route Clearance Activities. 

The equipment will be used by military staff from the NATO nations during operations in peace and wartime, under a broad range of climatic conditions. The equipment shall provide the operating forces with the capability to investigate, manipulate, and disrupt suspected IEDs in a variety of situations and environments, using the RCV with equipment payload.

The requirements are fairly wide, with the intention of guiding the companys choice of products to offer in order to provide NC3A with a set of options for RCVs and payloads for use against IEDs in the application areas of interest.

Technical requirements

 Physical form: The RCV should be small and light enough to be transported and deployed from a typical SUV-size vehicle.
 
 Mission life: The RCV should be capable of a typical mission life of four hours without recharging.

 Terrain handling: The RCV should be capable of on-road use, off-road use, and use within buildings, including the capability to climb stairs.

 Environmental: The RCV should be capable of operations in a broad range of environmental conditions, including desert conditions, snow, ice and rain.

 Speed: The control of speed should be variable, to allow both fast road use and precise control in closed or unstable physical conditions. In on-road or smooth off-road conditions, the RCV should be capable of maintaining pace with dismounted solders.

 Remote control: The RCV should be capable of being controlled out of direct line of sight of the operator, e.g., within a building. The control link should be selectable as wireless or physical (e.g., fiber optic).

 Payload: The RCV should be capable of operating with a range of payload configurations, including mixes of sensors (e.g., visible, IR, X-ray, microphones) and physical actuators (e.g., robotic arm, shotgun, vehicle entry devices). These should all be controlled by the operator and sensor data related in real time to the operator via the remote link.

 Payload maneuvering: The RCV should be capable of fine control of the pointing of payloads through precise control of the RCV itself (e.g., turning on the spot), control of the RCV stance, and/or fine control of payloads on extendable or robotic arms.

 Traction: The RCV should be capable of towing/pushing large objects, e.g., vehicles.

 Robustness: Although the RCV is expendable in the case of unintended IED detonation, the RCV should be robust and protected against typical operational use of, for example, ballistic payloads.

Information Required

1) The scope of the solution:

Please provide the following information based upon the requirements described above:

a) Indicate whether you would be able to provide a complete solution for both application areas: EOD Operations and Route Clearance Activities.

 b) Provide details of your products that fulfill part of the requirements, meet the requirements, or exceed the requirements. NC3A is also interested in solutions applicable to only one of the application areas.

c) Where the equipment offered does have a capability across both applications areas, indicate how costs are reduced through the use of common operation, training, maintenance, and test equipment.

d) Provide the technical details of the capability of the equipment with respect to the requirements above, including an approximate indication of the effectiveness of the systems and providing test results where possible. Include the payloads that you can offer and any third part payloads that are compatible with the offered RCVs.

The responses provided by companies will be treated as commercial-in-confidence, and will only be used for the purpose of defining a funding envelope for projects intending to procure such equipment and not selecting a product. Product selection will be done through the procurement process.

Overview

NC3A is interested in stand-off detection equipment to detect explosives and weapons (generically referred to as anomalies) concealed under clothing on personnel attempting to enter secure compounds via an Entry Control Point (ECP).  NC3A may have requirements for this type of equipment in the upcoming months and is primarily interested in the following sensor technologies: 1) millimeter wave imaging systems and 2) radar based systems. 

The equipment will be used by military staff from the NATO nations during operations in peace and wartime, under a broad range of climatic conditions. The requirements stated below are fairly wide, with the intention of guiding the companys choice of products to offer so as to provide NC3A with a set of options for stand-off detection equipment at a typical ECP.

A typical operational scenario can be described as follows:

 The entry conditions are controlled such that entering personnel can be scanned individually while walking or stopped for scanning if required.
 The scanning must take place with a stand-off from own forces and the scanning equipment.
 The scanning area will typically be outside (in the open); however, blast protection blocks and light roof cover may be used to partially enclose the scanning area.

Technical requirements

 Mission time: 24 hours per day continuous use.
 Throughput: Six people per minute per entry channel.
 Stand-off distance: in excess of 5m, desirably 50m.
 Detection Capability: The materials to be detected include explosives, weapons, and ceramics concealed under clothing of the entering personnel. It is desirable that detection occur automatically (without operator intervention) and that the anomalies detected can be discriminated by material type. The automated localization of the position of the anomalies on the body is of significant importance.
 Scanning capabilities: For imaging sensors, real time video rate scanning is desirable.
 Safety: The system emission levels shall be within safe limits for both operating personnel and personnel being scanned.
 Operation & Control: The sensors must be capable of remote operation together with remote display of images, video, and results from sensors. Automatic detection and discrimination results should also be displayed to cue operator action. Recording of sensor data is also required.
 Target set: The system shall be able to detect metallic and non-metallic objects hidden under regular clothing. The size and composition of the threats to be detected shall range from coins and cell phones to suicide vests.
 Countermeasures: The system must employ countermeasure techniques (e.g., filtering, data processing, etc.) in order to reduce the effect of potential jamming and camouflage. 

Information Required

1) The scope of the solution:

Please provide the following information based upon the requirements described above:

a) Indicate whether you would be able to provide solutions for both sensor types: millimeter wave and radar based.
b) Provide details of your products that fulfill part of the requirements, meet the requirements, or exceed the requirements. NC3A is also interested in individual sensors. It would also be beneficial to describe how overall performance can be optimized by using a mixture of sensor types in the deployment of the system.
c) Where both sensor types can be offered, indicate how costs are reduced through the use of common operation, training, maintenance, and test equipment.
d) Provide the technical details of the capability of the equipment with respect to the requirements above, including an approximate indication of the effectiveness of the systems and providing test results where possible. 
e) Provide information to illustrate your envisaged concept of operations for the equipment  e.g., operation, interoperability, training, programming, maintenance, and testing.

2) Further options:

a) Provide technical details of any options or further services you could offer that you believe could be of benefit to NATO in this application area.

3) Integrated Logistics Support options:

a) Provide details of the support equipment and services required (e.g., accessories, batteries, spares, calibration, testing, etc.)

4) ROM costs:

a) Provide a ROM cost estimate for the equipment, services, options, and support you offer in the answers above. The costs should be broken down by item and based on quantities of 5, 10, and 50 sensor systems. The cost breakdown should allow NC3A to estimate the cost of packages of mixes of sensors and support options in various quantities.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">BACKGROUND: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs in various countries throughout the world which address the entire range of customs and border control operations. To effectively implement these programs, CBP requires the services of skilled and knowledgeable individuals (i.e., contractors) on an intermittent (short-term) basis. Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 calendar days or less. Intermittent Contractors (ICs) will be required to perform various tasks such as providing training, utilizing specialized equipment, or providing of professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Note:</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> This is an annual notice, for Intermittent Contractors (Subject Matter Experts), announcing CBP's process and giving interested individuals and firms an opportunity to apply (see process below). There are no known immediate requirements but new requirements for these services may arise at any time. This notice will remain open and the opportunity for individuals/firms to apply will continue until this notice is modified to the contrary or canceled. The previous announcement/notice on this subject published at www.fbo.gov 2/4/2010 (#CBP-IC-2010-1) is canceled and superseded by this notice. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">ASSIGNMENT EXAMPLES: The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of an order/contract. </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Note:</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> While minor elements of performance under an order/contract may be performed in the United States (such as but not limited to meeting with program officials in Washington, DC or in other domestic locales, telephonic and/or email correspondence, etc.), primary performance of assignments is outside of the United States.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><br />1) Training: The IC may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter. Instruction may include, but is not limited to, the areas of narcotics interdiction, port security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation. In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">2) Course Development: The IC may be required to develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors, as required. Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control-related areas such as those described for TRAINING above. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">3) Assessments: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs administrations and other border control agencies located in foreign countries, as required. Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction, assessment of aviation equipment assets or of aviation programs, intellectual property rights, etc.). Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills to complete an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs, and to prepare summaries, analyses, recommendations, trip reports, and/or other written work product(s).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">4) Technical Assistance: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, and/or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">5) Augmentation of a Team: The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member. As an additional team member, the IC will undertake general or specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of personnel policies. As a replacement or fill-in, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional team member, or replacement member.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">CONTRACT/ORDER TERMS and CONDITIONS: </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Assignment Duration: It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 180 days in a 12 month (consecutive) period. Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice given prior to assignment/deployment, while some IC assignments may last up to the full 180 calendar days. In the event that a requirement must be extended beyond the 180 day period, a modification will be issued on a bilateral basis for such extension. ICs should note that international travel may occur on more than one occasion for a given order. If an IC declines more than two assignments, he or she may be excluded from further consideration at the discretion of CBP. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Possible Duty Locations: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP conducts operations. CBP training and assistance projects are currently ongoing in all regions of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Compensation and Other Reimbursements: 1) ICs will be compensated for their performance on a fixed-priced basis at the rate of $2,400.00 per week for all ICs or prorating thereof (i.e., $480.00/day, $60.00/hour), for the period of time estimated by CBP for completion of the assignment, excluding travel days. 2) All authorized hours worked will be paid at the above hourly rate. 3) There are no provisions for an overtime or premium rate. Work is generally to be performed during the normal workweek however, the Contractor may work on weekends and be compensated at normal hourly rate (i.e., $60.00) with the express authorization of the Contracting Officer and/or Program Manager. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Other Requirements: 1) Prospective ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a SECRET security clearance from CBP. If for some reason a clearance cannot be granted, the prospective IC may be excluded from consideration from any assignments calling for such clearances. 2) For some specific assignments, foreign language ability may be a requirement for selection. 3) All materials provided to or developed by the IC under a contract are the property of CBP, may not be released to any other party without express permission from CBP, and are subject to return to CBP upon conclusion of the contract (or sooner upon receipt of a request from CBP).</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Travel: All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders (separate and apart from the contract) and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations. ICs will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel. ICs are not authorized to receive an advance for expenses for lodging, meals and/or travel incidentals. The embassy will be making travel arrangements in country. Travel time to and from the United States (and within the United States) is not compensable for pay purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">CONSIDERATION of APPLICANTS: Both individuals and organizations are welcome to apply. Applications are to be submitted on an individual basis (one for each proposed IC applicant/person). Interested parties are to submit their qualifications in resume format, to be accompanied by a completed CBP - QUESTIONNAIRE FOR INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR available at FedBizOpps (accompanies this Notice). Beginning with the date of this notice, all applicants must submit the most recent revision of the questionnaire (currently Rev 8-07) in order to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In order to ensure that full consideration is given, applicants are encouraged to review the form OF-612, available at<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of612.pdf. A copy of the 6/2006 version available at the above website at the time this notice was published is also available at FedBizOpps. Applicants are encouraged to review the information and topics covered on the OF-612 form and ensure that their resumes contain the same data elements that appear in that form. Applicants should NOT use the form OF-612 for the purpose of submitting an application, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Resume packages (i.e., resume &amp; completed questionnaire) will be accepted by e-mail only. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS/FIRMS ARE TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS AND RELATING DOCUMENTS TO: </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><a href="mailto:CBPIC@cbp.dhs.gov">CBPIC@cbp.dhs.gov</a> </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">DO NOT SUBMIT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE STAFF. A representative of the designated receiving office (above) will acknowledge receipt of applications via email within 5 business days of receipt. If no acknowledgement is received within 5 business days after transmitting, applicants are encouraged to follow up by sending an email inquiry to the email address above to ensure receipt of their applications. If for some reason, the applicant still does not receive a response, the applicant is encouraged to follow up with the Contracting Officer.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">NOTE:</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> Applicants who applied under a previous notice/announcement are encouraged to submit new application packages in accordance with the guidance and requirements herein, to include a completed questionnaire.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">METHOD of SELECTION/OPERATION, INSURANCE and PHYSICAL EXAM REQUIREMENTS: The CBP Office of International Affairs will evaluate the resume and questionnaire packages received for technical ability. CBP may exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his/her qualifications from the documents submitted. Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a Qualified Bidders List from which IC candidates are selected and may be awarded an order/contract for one or more assignments in the future as needs arise. CBP will select the most highly qualified and available candidate for each given requirement. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Prospective ICs must be physically fit, able to perform the duties of an assignment and may be required to obtain a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 180 calendar days. If selected for a contract award and CBP elects to require that the prospective IC obtain a physical, CBP will reimburse the IC for reasonable actual costs (not to exceed $500.00) by including this item on the order/contract, as described above. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">ICs are required to obtain emergency evacuation insurance coverage when traveling to foreign locations. The order/contract document will provide for reimbursement of reasonable actual costs for this coverage (not to exceed $500.00). In situations where an IC currently has emergency evacuation insurance coverage in place which will extend through the period of proposed performance, new coverage need not be obtained. In such cases, the IC must present written proof of coverage to the officer making the inquiry as to availability before an order will be placed.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">REQUIRED REGISTRATION @ WWW.CCR.GOV: Prospective ICs must be registered and have "ACTIVE" status in the government CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR) system at www.ccr.gov prior to issuance of an order/contract. CBP strongly recommends that applicants complete their registration as soon as possible after submitting an application. The process involves input of business information and registration with Dun and Bradstreet to obtain a D&amp;B number. Applicants must include their D&amp;B/DUNs # on the questionnaire (see above). </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">NOTE:</span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> Applicants must follow up this process aggressively to ensure that ACTIVE status is attained. Registration data is valid for one year and must be updated at time of expiration in order for status to remain ACTIVE.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">ORDER/CONTRACT DOCUMENT, COMMENCEMENT OF PERFORMANCE, ORDER CEILING: Once CBP identifies a requirement and selects a prospective IC, a CBP officer will contact the applicant and inquire as to availability for an assignment. If the selected applicant is available and all requirements are satisfied, a CBP Contracting Officer will prepare a suitable order/contract document in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (i.e., FAR, viewable at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/). The order/contract will be in the form of a Labor Hours type contract awarded in accordance with FAR 16.602 and the document will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country/destination, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and other applicable information. The Contracting Officer will submit the completed order/contract document to the selected IC for review, concurrence, and acceptance. The order will become a legal binding contract once the Contracting Officer receives written acceptance from the IC. The duration of contract performance shown on the contract document and resulting dollar amount constitutes a ceiling, beyond which the IC performs at his/her own risk. If needs arise which call for the IC to provide services for an additional period of time, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification which provides necessary funding and authorization for continued performance within specified limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">ORDER/CONTRACT INVOICING and PAYMENTS: Payments are processed by CBP in arrears, in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by FAR clause <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, with its Alternate 1. </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>ICs are to submit an invoice for services rendered under their contract no more frequently than once per month (in arrears), unless otherwise specifically authorized in the order/contract document. It is suggested that ICs submit their monthly invoice during the first week of each calendar month for services performed during the previous calendar month. IC monthly invoices must comply with the requirements of FAR 32.905.

This announcement constitutes the only notice.
This is not a request for quotes.
Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Fish & Wildlife Services, Region 7 Contracting and General Services intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price order to:
FOR :	JETA/AVGAS Purchase, storage and pumping in support of Polar Bear Project on Chukchi SeaFROM:	March 12, 2011 to approx May 15, 2011NAICS:	488190	Other Support Activities for Air TransportationAUTHORITY:	8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval  13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source
Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because:
Red Dog mine and port site are owned and operated by Teck Cominco Alaska Incorporated dba: Red Dog Mine.   There is no airstrip at the port site thus fuel can only be supplied at this site via helicopter, barge, or road.  Suppliers of Jet A and aviation gas in nearby areas, such as Crowley in Kotzebue, can only supply fuel to this site if there is an airstrip. No airstrip is available at the port site.  In addition, we would have to coordinate the use of any outside suppliers with Teck Cominco Alaska, inc who owns and operates the port site.  Thus, we are not aware of any other supplier of Jet A and aviation gas to the port site of Red Dog mine.
The supply/service is needed in support of a research effort to capture polar bears in the Chukchi Sea; a crew of biologists will be working with a helicopter based out of Red Dog mine port site.  Teck Cominico Alaska, Inc dba: Red Dog Mine owner/operator of the port site has provided a tank for Jet A at the port site for exclusive use by our research program during this time.  No other aircraft operate at the port while we are there.  The tank is filled from a larger tank that is located at the inland mine site and transported by road to the port site.  They also supply aviation gas in barrels.  We will have two helicopters based at the port site.  From March 12-May1 we will have a Bell206 longranger which uses jet A from the tank and between April 6 and 30th we will have an R44 helicopter that uses aviation gas.  
Teck Cominco Alaska, Inc transports fuel via truck from their mine site along a local road that they maintain to the port site tank.

One of their tasks will be to haul drums of Jet A fuel out onto the sea ice to refill a helicopter used for capturing polar bears.  We are, therefore, in need of a vendor that can refill fuel drums with Jet A at the Kotzebue airstrip where the pilot will land and offload the drums to be refilled.  Over the past two years (2009 and 2010), Bering Air was found to be the only source able to provide this service. There are no other suppliers of Jet A in Kotzebue.  
The vendor will need to be available to refill drums, supplied by the Service via the contracted fixed wing pilot, with Jet A at the Kotzebue airstrip as arranged between the fixed wing pilot and the vendor between March 12 and May 10, 2011.  We have estimated the maximum amount of JetA that is needed between March 12 and May 10, 2011 is 2000 gallons.

In support of the annual research project that involves capturing polar bears on the sea ice off the Chukchi Sea coast, Service personnel will be traveling to Red Dog Mine's port site south of Kivalina as a field base for capture efforts. This location has been used for the past 3 years as a logistics base for the capture effort.  This procurement is for: "	Seat Fares on Red Dog Mine's charter with Alaska Airlines to move FWS personal and Government Contractors between ANC - Red Dog Mine and Red Dog Mine - ANC"	Room and Board for FWS personal and Government Contractors at Red Dog Mine"	Frieght/Shipping of field equipment on Red Dog Mine's existing charter for cargo
The location of Red Dog Mine's port site is critical for successful operation of this annual capture season.  This is the most effective location in which to access the sea ice. The Government has attempted to work out of local villages in the past which are the only other locations in which to base capture operations.  However, spring whaling occurs during the time period of the Government operations and local communities do not want the Government to operate the required helicopters and aircraft out of their communities at that time due to potential disturbance to migrating whales.  Teck Cominco Alaska, Inc dba: Red Dog Mine owns and manages all facilities at the port site, including the airstrip, charter with Alaska Airlines, and port facilities, that include lodging with a kitchen.  
No other sources are in or around this location.

Offerors shall submit their quote on letterhead stationery; provide unit prices with a grand total. ORCA or Representations and Certifications will be required.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />(i) Price <br />(ii) Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />(i) Price<br />(ii) Technical Acceptability</p>
<p><strong>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD <br /></strong><br />This is a competitive best value evaluation in which the competing offerors will be ranked by price and then determined technically acceptable (LPTA). Certifications and past performance experience will be evaluated in order to determine if the offeror is technically "acceptable". By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. Unless explicitly noted in the proposal, all offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br /><br />A. Price Evaluation. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including any option prices if applicable. An offeror's quoted prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in attachment 5 by the quoted unit price for each Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each. The extended amounts will be added together to determine the total evaluated price. When applicable, the price evaluation adjustment for HUBZone small business concerns will be applied in accordance with FAR 52.219-4, Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for HUBZone Small Business Concerns, to arrive at an evaluated price. The price evaluation will document (for the offers evaluated under paragraph B below) the reasonableness and affordability of the quoted total evaluated price.<br /><br />B. Technical Acceptability. Only the five (5) lowest price offeror's past performance information will be analyzed. This solicitation does not require the submission of a separate technical quote however; maintenance on the digital secured trunking system located on Barksdale AFB must be performed by a factory trained Motorola technician using only genuine Motorola replacement parts in accordance with the warranty. In order to determine technical acceptability, training certificates are required to be included with past performance information. <br /><br />(1)Certificates must indicate training on a Motorola Astro 7.4 Digital Secured Trunking System or higher. Certificates should be submitted for the person who will be performing the actual maintenance. <br /><br />(2) Past performance The five (5) lowest price offerors will be evaluated based on (1) their past performance information submittals and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment as "Go/No Go". The evaluation of the five (5) lowest price offers past performance until an offeror is rated "Go" or until all offerors are evaluated. While the Government evaluation team and the contracting officer will strive for maximum objectivity, the evaluation process, by its nature, is subjective and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire evaluation process. <br /><br />Relevant past performance includes, but is not limited to, digital trunking system maintenance experience. Recent past performance consists of contracts, completed or in progress, performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years from date of issuance of this solicitation. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this RFQ, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. <br />Past performance regarding joint ventures, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major requirements or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "No Go," meaning the rating is treated unfavorably. <br /><br />Past performance data required is: contract number, contract performance period, contract award amount, brief description of effort, and government or private issuing activity point of contract/telephone number. <br /><br />C. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.<br /><br />(End of provision)<br /><br />THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT INCOMPLETE QUOTES. Offers will be evaluated on the prices as offered. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. If an offer cannot comply with every requirement, then the offer will not be rated as technically acceptable, and therefore will not be considered. Once an offer with the lowest price has been determined to be technically acceptable, and in compliance with all directions in this solicitation, the Government will award to the offeror.<br /><br />Quotes can be faxed (in accordance with FAR provision 52.214-13 TELEGRAPHIC BIDS) to the attention of A1C Jeffery Hairston at (318) 456-3648 no later than 25 Feb 2011 at 12:00pm (CST). Offers received after this date and time will be considered as late submissions in accordance with 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated or considered. Please refer any questions to A1C Jeffery D.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation #W91LV2SDALLAS is hereby issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) for lodging during the period of 2-6 March 2011 in the Dallas, Texas area. This procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside. Only small businesses under NAICS Code 721110 are being solicited resulting in a COMPETITIVELY awarded purchase order contract. The small business size standard for NAICS code 721110 is $30,000,000 or less. Note: The small business size standard for Hotels has recently been increased from $7.5M to $30M. All vendors are requested to update their CCR records to reflect any changes that may be necessary to reflect their current size standard. The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide contracted services as set forth below and in the attachments. The anticipated award will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP)-type contract. Vendors must submit quotes on the full quantity identified. Award shall be made to a single vendor. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to make no award under this procedure. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. QUOTES MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION. FAILURE TO SUBMIT ANY OF THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WILL RESULT IN A REJECTED BID DUE TO NON-RESPONSIVENESS: a) a list of three (3) references for a similar stay.

For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offerors services as a prime contractor and forward a copy of a signed, written agreement between the offeror and a representative who has binding authority of stated hotel facility.

Authorized Workers Notice to Potential Bureau of Reclamation Contractors(a)	Definitions.  		IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service 		SSA - Social Security Administration		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
 	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
 	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm .
	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
 	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
 	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
 	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.

The Vendor Response Document must be submitted with any proposal and the last page includes a list of other required items.  REQUIRED.

<DESC>To be the Governments leader in acquisition services, GSA sets the highest standards for its acquisition programs. With the recent award of 15 BPAs of Office Supplies in support of the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) and to best allocate government resources, GSA temporarily postponed Schedule 75 to new Multiple Awards Schedules (MAS) offers for 24 months, effective October 1, 2010. At the end of that time, GSA will evaluate and reassess the effectiveness of the program. 

*This solicitation continues to be postponed to new offers.

GSA still recognizes the important role of our schedule holders who have long supported the MAS program. Since holding a schedule contract is a very expensive proposition for the schedule holder and GSA, we are reallocating our resources to better serve our customer base. Current Schedule 75 contract holders with available options that are successfully performing will continue to be exercised. Additionally, modification requests to existing contracts will still be honored. 

Questions regarding postponement:

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NIAID- NOI-11066, a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-49 dated January 24, 2011. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414, which has a size standard of 500. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure fifty (50) Leukapheresis/Tissue Specimens and sixty (60) Blood Specimen samples from Maple Leaf Medical HIV Research Collaborative Inc. The purpose of this requirement of samples is to continue investigation from rare HIV patients as we are actively studying whether HIV can be eradicated in patients. Our plan is to study cells from such individuals in order to understand the factors involved in accelerated decay of HIV in vivo. These specimens can only be obtained from 0.1-0.2% of the HIV patient population and the only known source at this time is Maple Leaf Medical HIV Research Collaborative, which has a large cohort of these patients. This requires screening of a large number of patients that will be subjected to determination of his or her CD4+ T cell count, plasma viral load, and disease status. Upon the screening procedures, a selected number of patients will be subjected to leukapheresis followed by cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It is vital to the lab's ongoing research to continue using Maple Leaf Medical HIV Research Collaborative because the data being used must be consistent with previous results under Protocol #Z01A1000851-05 Role of Viral Reservoirs in the Pathogenesis of HIV Disease. It would be detrimental to the research of the Government to change vendors at this time. Award will be based on 1) capability to meet salient characteristics, 2) price, and 3) delivery. Delivery shall be on an as-needed basis for ten (10) months from date of award to Bethesda, Maryland, 20892. The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor. The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30. The following Federal Acquisition Regulations provisions and clauses apply to the acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; Far 52.212-3 Offeror Representation and Certifications Commercial Items; Far 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; Far 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; and FAR 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003). A completed copy of provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representation and Certifications Commercial Items must be included with submission and can be found at Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) https://orca.bpn.gov.

(1)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
(2)  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Submit written proposals referencing document number N1526115076 in accordance with the instructions in this announcement
(3)  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-49.
(4)  This solicitation is being issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  The associated NAICS code is 115310.  The small business size standard is annual sales of $7 million.
(5)  This combined solicitation synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item:
	Carbaryl spraying of pine trees in Rocky Mountain National Park to prevent the spread of pine 	beetles.
(6)  Description of requirement is as follows:
This contract is for the application of a Carbaryl based insecticide to protect selected high value trees from bark beetle attack.  The work is divided geographically between the east and west sides of Rocky Mountain National Park.  Contract spraying may begin on April 4, 2011 and must be completed no later than May 27, 2011.   Trail Ridge Road access from one side of the park to the other may not be available, due to snow levels, prior to the May 27th contract completion date.  If administrative travel is permitted for NPS employees, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) may escort the contractor through the Park if administrative vehicular travel requirements are met by the contractor. 	Logistical challenges may vary by site and multiple sites may require extensive covering of sensitive surfaces that include but are not limited to: vehicles, water faucets, picnic tables, fire grates, RV's, clothes lines, BBQ grills and hand railings.  All materials and equipment (tarps, flagging, chemical, etc) are to be provided by the contractor.  Contractors must be state-licensed commercial applicators.  It is the contractor's responsibility to obtain current knowledge and maintain compliance with all local, state and federal regulations.  Site closures and pre-treatment notifications will be conducted and managed by park personnel.  A designated COR will orient the contractor to each site and provide final approval to treat upon confirmation that the sites are closed, properly prepared and favorable spray conditions exist. 
Work delays (up to several days) may occur for some treatment locations due time required to coordinate site closures and associated notifications.  Additional delays should be expected due to frequent unfavorable weather conditions.  In 2010, approximately half of the eligible days for spraying did not meet the environmental conditions acceptable for spraying.  Weather conditions are often much different from other areas along the frontrange. Some sites (denoted with an "*") may have a very limited number of days in which they will be available to be treated.  The 2011 contract will require the contractor to provide the COR with a summary of spray details for each location as described in requirement 3 below. 
Submittals required after award and prior to beginning contract work:
1) Copies of the state commercial pesticide applicator license for each applicator scheduled to work on the project.  Government issued identification may be requested to confirm the identity of the applicator and their respective spray certifications. 
2 )Copies of the label and MSDS for the proposed insecticide to be used must also be submitted prior to beginning work and the contractor must maintain a copy in possession on site at all times during project operations. 
3)  Evidence of Liability insurance 
4)  Proposed schedule of spraying must be submitted to and approved by COR prior to work beginning
Treatment Requirements and Limitations1.	Treatment may begin no earlier that April 4th, 2011 and be completed by May 27th, 2011 unless conditions warrant a contract extension as determined by COR and agreed upon with the contractor.2.	Treatment may be conducted Monday through Friday when daylight allows visibility of the entire target tree, or as refined by the COR.3.	Within 30 days of the contract completion, the contractor must supply the COR with a project summary, including a list of locations sprayed, the number of trees sprayed, total pesticide applied, total active ingredient applied for each location and pH test results from each tank fill.4.	Due to closure requirements, some sites (listed with *) will have restricted days and hours for treatment.  This will likely include one afternoon during a weekend for each site.  5.	All trees to be treated will be marked with a light blue tree paint dot near the base of the tree on the side of the tree facing the nearest road.  Only trees marked with light blue dots may be treated.6.	All portions of marked trees greater than 3 inches in diameter at least 50 feet must be treated.  This includes the trunk, large branches and exposed roots until they taper down to less then 3 inches in diameter.  It is required that all sides and areas of the tree above be thoroughly covered with insecticide. 7.	After a tree has been successfully treated (or moments before) the contractor may mark the tree in a manner approved by the COR.8.

<CONTACT>Stefan Martiyan

<a href="mailto:martiyan.stefan@epa.gov">Stefan Martiyan, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) has a requirement for the purchase of one (1) autoclave.  The autoclave will replace an existing non-operational unit, which will be used for the Select Agent (Bacillus anthracis)-registered laboratory in order to decontaminate biohazardous materials.
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR QUOTE.
The current autoclave is a Steris Amsco Century SG-120.  Its inner dimensions are 20" x 20" x 38".  Its outer dimensions are 46" x  30" x 76.5".  The unit has a single power door and is not recessed through a wall.  The replacement autoclave must fit into the footprint of the Steris Amsco Century SG-120 and have the same utility requirements.  This is essential because of the amount of space available, the location of the exhaust canopy, the floor drain, and the electric supply location cannot be changed.
In accordance with FAR Subpart 11.104, this item is being solicited on a brand name or equal purchase basis.  The brand name is Steris Corporation.  A general description of the requirement's salient characteristics is as follows:
1.	Unit must have a chamber size of approximately 20" x 20" x 38".2.	Unit must have outer dimensions similar to 46" x  30" x 76.5" so that it fits into the current unit's footprint and so that all other salient characteristics are still met.3.	Unit must have a single power door.4.	Unit must not be recessed through any walls.5.	Unit must have programmable cycles and provide both gravity and liquid cycles.6.	Unit must be able to program in degrees Celsius.7.	Unit must have an automatically-flushing integral steam generator.8.	Unit generator must be equipped with a system to prevent scale build up over time in order to extend the life of the unit.9.	Unit must have a water saving control system and automatic utilities startup/shutdown.10.	Unit must have an optimal solution cooling system in place for liquid cycles, which will be used to sterilize prepared media in bottles and tubes.11.	Unit must have a control system that provides an easy-to-read display, continuous cycle monitoring and control, and protects critical components from heat and moisture to avoid recurring and expensive circuit board replacement.12.	Unit must have a self-prompting display.13.	Unit must have printer with easy spool replacement.14.	Unit available accessories must include a rack and two (2) shelves.
Additionally, the successful vendor must be able to:  de-install the current Steris Amsco Century SG-120 autoclave and remove it from the site; install the new autoclave within thirty (30) days after receipt of order (ARO); and provide, at least, a one (1) year preventative maintenance agreement.
*Note - the successful vendor will have ownership of the current autoclave after its de-installation and removal from the site.  Given that the current unit has a value, offerors may find it wise to reduce their price quote accordingly.  The reason for the current autoclave?s inoperability is unknown.
Vendors must meet all characteristics as described above in order to be acceptable for award.  Vendors will be evaluated on a lowest-priced, technically acceptable basis.  Interested vendors are instructed to submit a price proposal for a brand name or equal item in response to this solicitation no later than the response date.
All responses and/or questions should be sent via email to Stefan Martiyan at martiyan.stefan@epa.gov.  The deadline for submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation is 4 March 2011, 3:00 PM, ET.  Late responses will not be evaluated for award.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>POC: Nina Patel, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Morocco:  Essaouira Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop Technical Assistance for the Morocco:  Essaouira Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant.</p>
<p>Morocco has limited indigenous fossil fuel resources and consequently relies on imports, particularly coal and oil, to meet more than 97% of the country's energy needs.  This reliance makes Morocco vulnerable to volatile changes in the price of oil, natural gas and other forms of energy.  In 2008, the country expended over $8 billion to meet its energy needs through imports, with additional government subsidies totaling $1.5 billion to regulate consumer prices of these petroleum products.  At the same time, energy demand is rising by approximately 7% per year while capacity is growing at only half that rate.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Government of Morocco (GOM) has recognized the vital need to develop long-term, sustainable sources of energy by exploiting the country's vast indigenous, renewable energy resources.  The GOM has launched a national renewable energy and energy efficiency plan that aims to achieve installed generation capacity of 2 GW each from solar, wind and hydro resources by 2020; representing a potential renewable energy input of 42% of total energy capacity.  The GOM is highly committed to the development of renewable sources of energy and is moving to implement several projects and initiatives.</p>
<p>This ambitious program is supported by several regulatory and financial initiatives, and by the recent creation of public sector entities, such as ADEERE.  ADEERE was established in January 2010 under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment.  ADEERE's mission is to oversee small-scale renewable energy projects and pilot programs; conduct research of the development of renewable energy; and coordinate project implementation with other sector stakeholders to support long-term sustainable development of Morocco's energy policies.</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance will support ADEERE's objectives through providing a detailed assessment for the implementation of a 5 MW solar PV pilot power plant in Essaouira.  The pilot project is expected to showcase the applicability of solar PV technology on a utility scale and will serve as a model for duplication throughout Morocco in similar sized cities with limited grid access.  The Technical Assistance will identify the specific needs of a solar PV power facility including preferred and alternative site evaluation; technological and financial assessments; engineering; permitting analysis, and project implementation planning.</p>

<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>There have been some questions that have been asked by potential offerors regarding this solicitation. Those questions have been sent to the engineer and he has provided responses listed below:
<p>1. The Purchase Description describes a Vibration Secondary Calibration System (VSCS). The solicitation announcement (including the CLINs) does not refer to VSCS.<br />Instead the solicitation uses the terminolgy "Base Reference Standards" and "Accelerometers" for what the government wants to procure: "Offerors are requested to provide pricing for 70 Base Reference Standards and 77 Accelerometers". A Base Reference Standard and accelerometers are small parts of the VSCS - how many VSCS units are being requested?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: The quantities are 70 Vibration Secondary Calibration Standards (VSCS) without Base Reference Standard Accelerometers (System 1, reference par 1 of<br />Purchase Description) and 77 Base Reference Standard Accelerometers (System 2, reference par 1.0 of Purchase Description).</p>
<p><br />2. Is it the intent that the vendor supply impedance match resistors as part of this solicitation to meet the input impedance requirements in section 3.16?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: No, the vendor does not have to supply resistors for the impedance requirements in section 3.16.</p>
<p><br />3.Please explain the requirement definition for the constant displacement excitation control (section 3.8). Does this mean that the system must have 1) velocity AND displacement capabilities or 2) velocity OR displacement capability (one or the other)? Also does this mean that a DUT profile will be specified in terms of a maximum velocity/displacement limit?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Yes, the VSCS must have velocity AND displacement capabilities, and yes the DUT profile shall be specified in terms of maximum displacement limit,<br />but No not for maximum velocity.</p>

<p>This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures in accordance with FAR 13.3 Simplified Acquisition Methods, and FAR Part 13.5</p>
<p>The resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-049. The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $6.5 million.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted as a full open competition with set aside for a small business only. The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 334516 and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Government=s anticipated delivery date is one year after receipt of purchase order.</p>
<p>The Government=s acceptance terms and FOB point are the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>Background Information<br />The Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Branch of the Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is one of the premier cardiovascular programs in the country that develops new methods for the study of cardiovascular disease and the application of image-guided therapies. The Cardiovascular Interventional Program has conducted work that includes wholly real-time MRI guided vascular interventional procedures in humans, as well as preclinical development of novel interventional procedures for the treatment of congenital heart disease.</p>
<p><br />The procurement of a new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Cardiovascular Interventional Coil shall improve the performance of rapid imaging for interventional applications and enable new procedures to be developed. A coil is sought which contains multiple surface coil elements optimized for accelerated imaging, and fenestrations, which will allow direct access to the thorax.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of the proposed acquisition is to identify qualified organizations that can manufacture a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coil, which has fenestrations (windows) to allow the passage of interventional devices. The coil will be used for preclinical and clinical MRI guided cardiovascular interventions at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), conducted on a clinical Siemens 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner. The coil must conform to the specific technical requirements listed below.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />The NHLBI requires that the MRI Cardiovascular Interventional Coil be of clinical grade to support sterile patient procedures, and to interface to MRI scanners currently installed, as well as the next generation. Detailed requirements are listed below.<br />Services to be performed<br />The Contractor shall deliver an MRI Cardiovascular Interventional Coil to NHLBI, along with supporting files that enable the coil to be recognized by and function with the MRI scanner. The coil should connect to the existing MRI system, as well as the next generation system. A delivery timeline and warranty period should be specified.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements:<br />(1) The coil must connect to a Siemens 1.5 Tesla scanner. The NHLBI currently has an Espree, which will be upgraded to an Aera. The coil must be able to connect to both models.<br />(2) The coil should cover the anterior and posterior surfaces of the thorax.<br />(3) The anterior portion of the coil should accommodate different body shapes. This may be accomplished either by the use of a flexible form factor or by multiple segments.<br />(4) The coil should cover a nominal imaging field of view of a minimum of 30cm (Right - Left) x 30cm (Head - Foot).<br />(5) The coil should contain a minimum of two fenestrations on each (Right, Left) side of the anterior portion of the coil, to allow access to the intercostal spaces.<br />(6) It is desirable for the coil to contain fenestrations along the midline of the chest, to allow access to the sub-xiphoid space.<br />(7) The fenestrations in the coil should be a minimum of 3cm long in the smallest dimension.<br />(8) The fenestrations should be able to made sterile, so that sterile devices that pass through remain sterile. <br />(9) The coil should contain a minimum of 8 elements in each (anterior and posterior) portion, to enable parallel imaging. More than 8 elements are desirable.</p>
<p><br />Evaluation Criteria<br />The proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria;</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria (total 100 points)<br />The proposals shall be evaluated by NIH with regards to the design and anticipated performance of the coil. Weight shall be given to the timeliness of delivery, technical performance, and overall design<br />1) Schedule (20 pts)<br />a. The final version of the coil must be delivered within one year after the contract is awarded. Prototypes may be delivered for testing and technical feedback at intermediate times. <br />2) Performance (35 pts)<br />a. The coil must perform equivalently or better than the current Siemens cardiac array (also called body array), in terms of signal-to-noise during non-accelerated imaging. NHLBI is willing to work with the vendor to perform these tests at the NIH.<br />b. The coil must perform equivalently or better than the current Siemens cardiac array (also called body array), in terms of signal-to-noise and "G-factor" when performing accelerated imaging. NHLBI is willing to work with the vendor to perform these tests at the NIH.<br />3) Design (45 pts)<br />a. The coil must connect to a Siemens 1.5 Tesla scanner. The NHLBI currently has an Espree, which will be upgraded to an Aera. The coil must be able to connect to both models. <br />i. A coil file must be supplied by the vendor, which will enable the coil to be recognized by the Siemens scanner.<br />ii. The coil code must not conflict with any currently used product or custom coils used. This code should be chosen together by the NIH and the vendor.<br />c. The coil should cover the anterior surface of the thorax. For the posterior portion, one of two options are acceptable:<br />i. A second coil to cover the posterior portion (preferable).<br />ii. Use of the Siemens spine coil to cover the posterior portion. However, the performance of parallel imaging must still be acceptable.<br />d. The anterior portion of the coil should accommodate different body shapes. This may be accomplished either by the use of a flexible form factor or by multiple segments.<br />e. The coil should cover a nominal imaging field of view of a minimum of 30cm (Right - Left) x 30cm (Head - Foot).<br />f. The coil should contain a minimum of two fenestrations on each (Right, Left) side of the anterior portion of the coil, to allow access to the intercostal spaces.<br />g. It is desirable for the coil to contain fenestrations along the midline of the chest, to allow access to the sub-xiphoid space.<br />h. The fenestrations in the coil should be a minimum of 3cm long in the smallest dimension.<br />i. The fenestrations should be able to be made sterile, so that sterile devices that pass through remain sterile. <br />j. The coil should contain a minimum of 8 elements in the anterior portion of the coil. If a posterior portion is delivered, a minimum of 8 elements should be included in the posterior portion as well. More than 8 elements are desirable.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NIAID- NOI-11066, a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-49 dated January 24, 2011. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414, which has a size standard of 500. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure fifty (50) Leukapheresis/Tissue Specimens and sixty (60) Blood Specimen samples from Maple Leaf Medical HIV Research Collaborative Inc. The purpose of this requirement of samples is to continue investigation from rare HIV patients as we are actively studying whether HIV can be eradicated in patients. Our plan is to study cells from such individuals in order to understand the factors involved in accelerated decay of HIV in vivo. These specimens can only be obtained from 0.1-0.2% of the HIV patient population and the only known source at this time is Maple Leaf Medical HIV Research Collaborative, which has a large cohort of these patients. This requires screening of a large number of patients that will be subjected to determination of his or her CD4+ T cell count, plasma viral load, and disease status. Upon the screening procedures, a selected number of patients will be subjected to leukapheresis followed by cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It is vital to the lab's ongoing research to continue using Maple Leaf Medical HIV Research Collaborative because the data being used must be consistent with previous results under Protocol #Z01A1000851-05 Role of Viral Reservoirs in the Pathogenesis of HIV Disease. It would be detrimental to the research of the Government to change vendors at this time. Award will be based on 1) capability to meet salient characteristics, 2) price, and 3) delivery. Delivery shall be on an as-needed basis for ten (10) months from date of award to Bethesda, Maryland, 20892. The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor. The FOB terms are "Destination" and Net 30. The following Federal Acquisition Regulations provisions and clauses apply to the acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; Far 52.212-3 Offeror Representation and Certifications Commercial Items; Far 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; Far 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; and FAR 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003). A completed copy of provisions at FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representation and Certifications Commercial Items must be included with submission and can be found at Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) https://orca.bpn.gov. By submission of an offer, the Offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective Awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. The CCR website is http://www/ccr.gov. [Note: Lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration will make an Offeror ineligible for award.] All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by the Agency. Offers must be submitted no later than 5:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on&nbsp;March 4, 2011. For delivery of responses through the Postal Service, the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, Room 2NE52D, MSC 4811, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4811.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Additional questions and answers received as of 17 February 2011:<br /><br /><br />Q: I have not been able to find any rolls of tape that are 100 yards. Do you have a particular brand or manufacturer in mind? Or would you accept 60 yard rolls?<br />A: If you can't find 100 yard rolls then 60 yards per roll is ok. However, the minimum number of yards per city package is 100, so if providing 60 yard rolls the quote would have to include two 60 yard rolls per city package. Amendment 0002 to the solicitation changed the salient characteristic of CLIN 0030 to a minimum of 100 yards per city package.
<p><br />Q: CLIN's 0026 - 0029 contain conflicting information regarding which Onguard boot they want, or rather, the item listing asks for 2 different boots in one description (see below). The Hazmax E-Z fit is 11" and sized S, M, L, XL, and the Hazmax Kneeboot is 16" and in sizes 6 - 15.<br />A: We are requesting the 16" Hazmax Kneeboot in four different size ranges. We understand the 16 inch comes in Sizes 6-15 and have matched the numerical sizes to small, medium, large, and extra large. Size small corresponds to numerical sizes 6-8, size medium to numerical sizes 9-10, size large to sizes 11-12 and size XL to sizes 13-15. So for size small, we are requesting a quantity of 20 in the size range of 6-8. Amendment 0002 to the solicitation changed the name from Hazmax EZ-Fit Boots or equivalent to Hazmax Kneeboots or equivalent.</p>
<p><br />Q: The vendor we are working with to obtain the Dupont Tychem Level B Protective Coveralls and the Dupont Tychem Level C Coveralls is selling the items in packs of 6 or 12. So instead of the requested quantities of 100, 200, 250 and 1000 for line items 0016-0019 it works out to quantities of 102, 198, 252, and 996. Is this acceptable?<br />A: No, the quantities listed in the solicitation are firm quantities and the quote must provide at least the requested quantities of 100, 200, 250, and 1000 for these line items.</p>

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses, and General Purpose Warehouses located West of the Mississippi River (AR, AZ, CA, CO, IA, KS, LA, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, NM, NV, OK, OR, SD, TX, UT, WA, WY).  The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Cody Cotten, 817-886-1077; or by e-mail at cody.d.cotten@usace.army.mil .  FOR INFORMATION ONLY: FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Business Process. USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but are also the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned. Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization. Of those forty one, Fort Worth District (SWF) has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WT) facilities, Reception Station Barracks, Drill Sergeant Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses, Support Supply Activity Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The IDIQ contracts for Barracks are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) and Northeast ( CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion. The IDIQ contracts for Warehouses are located in East and West of the Mississippi River and have been distributed accordingly.<BR>SCOPE OF WORK: <BR><BR>Central Issue Warehouses:  The primary mission of the CIFs is to provide a single point for receipt, storage, issue, exchange, and return of all authorized organizational clothing and individual equipment items at the specified United States Army Installation.  CIF facilities provide storage capabilities combined with office space, used in the administration of issuing soldiers equipment as needed.  The facilities support open storage for deployment functions as necessary by the Army Unit occupying the building.  The functional and operational requirements of the CIW require that the design be based on the characteristics of the material being handled and stored, the volume and flow pattern through the facility, and the inventory pattern.  Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will vary as required to meet project specific requirements.<BR>Support Supply Activity Warehouses: SSAs will provide a facility capable of storing and maintaining the Army prepositioned stocks (APS) and items required for active duty operation.  The facility is similar to a parts wholesale warehouse.  The functional and operational requirements of the SSA require that the design be based on the Adapt-Build Model standard design.    Therefore, the overall building design and configurations will not vary.<BR>General Purpose Warehouses: GPWs will be capable of supporting the storage of various equipment and materials, up to a Moderate-hazard level.  GPW facilities may have substantially differing design and operational requirements in order to meet the Armys needs on a worldwide basis.  The facility type will provide an acceptable relationship between actual equipment dimensions, performance characteristics and the building dimensions.  GPWs are intended to be similar both functionally and technically to private sector industrial warehouses  Supporting facilities include utilities; electric service; water, sewer, gas; paving, walks, curbs and gutters; storm drainage; site improvements and information systems.  Access for persons with disabilities will be provided in public areas.  Comprehensive building and furnishings related interior design services are required.  Comprehensive warehouse pallet and racking systems related to warehouse functional design services are required.  Air conditioning will be provided in administrative areas, and warehouse areas will be ventilated and heated.  Supporting work includes fire protection sprinkler and fire detection systems of the warehouses.  <BR>It is the intent of Government to issue design-build and adapt-build Request for Proposals (RFPs) under the contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation, which may be used as the basis for subsequent RFPs/task orders at the same or other installations within the region.<BR>CONTRACT INFORMATION:   <BR>This solicitation will be evaluated under the Two Phase Design Build Process.  In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offerors) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the performance capability proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 5 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror, whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.  To meet the minimum guarantee, the Government anticipates awarding the initial task at time of contract award unless funds are not available to award.  In that case, the Government will award the contract with the minimum guarantee.  <BR>The following evaluation criteria listed are of descending importance and shall be used in this solicitation unless modified by amendment prior to receipt of proposals: Phase I  Specialized Experience; Past Performance; and Organization and Technical Approach;  Phase II  Volume I: Building Functional, Aesthetics and Space; Quality of Building Systems and Materials; Site Design; and Sustainability Requirements.  Volume II:  Proposed Contract Duration and Summary Schedule; and Utilization of Small Business Concerns.  All technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price.  <BR>Estimated solicitation issue date is on or about 18 Oct 2010 under solicitation number W9126G-11-R-0053.  This procurement is HUBZone set-aside.  Phase 1 Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about 18 Nov 2010 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction).  The Small Business Size Standard is $33.5 Million.<BR><BR>MATOC: <BR>The Government intends to award at least two and up to five contracts as a result of this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right to award only the initial task as a C-type, stand alone contract if it is determined that firms responding do not have the past performance, required bonding, or demonstrated experience for a contract of this magnitude.  The remaining capacity would then be re-advertised as a full and open competition.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any remaining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed among the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance. The Government reserves the right to award additional contracts for the MATOC pool from a separate solicitation.   Other solicitations for similar work in this same region may be advertised to meet the Governments needs for this facility type.  THIS SOLICITATION IS SET-ASIDE FOR HUBZone.<BR><BR>The total estimated contract capacity is $263,000,000.  The estimated duration for each contract award will be an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to 4 Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of 60 months.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract for a lesser duration than stated herein if it is determined in the best interests of the Government.  The minimum guarantee will be $ 2,500.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.   The minimum task order limitation is $1,000,000.  The maximum task order limitation for the contracts is $19,000,000.  The maximum combination of orders is $17,500,000.

<DESC>The work includes the construction of an approximately 720 foot earth channel between the end of an existing concrete box culvert and Kennedy Avenue, including demolition of miscellaneous features, clearing and grubbing, constructing new steel channel walls and anchorages adjacent to the existing box culvert, earthwork for the channel, deep soil mixing, and stone channel base material. An existing 90-inch diameter sanitary effluent outfall main is to be relocated, while remaining active; including the use of pile supported temporary and permanent piping. The work also includes construction vibration monitoring and control, site drainage, pavements, fencing, pile tests and incidental related work.<BR>The project work occurs in three general phases. The objective of Phase 1, Exploratory Excavation and Preparation, is to locate and document the existing outfall main so that a new relocated main can be accurately constructed. Work in this phase includes: clearing and grubbing along with degrading portions of the site; cutting off flows of surface water into the site by plugging the existing box culvert near one end of the work area and building an earthen berm near the other end; determining precise location and elevations of the existing outfall main; and installing a cofferdam and bracing system along with protective measures adjacent to the outfall main. In Phase 2, Sanitary Outfall Main Relocation, the objective is to construct a new main along an alignment below the new channel while keeping effluent flows continuous.
