<a href="mailto:elizabeth.morin3@va.gov">Elizabeth Morin, Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>Project No. 542-12-106, Correct Electrical Deficiencies Phase 2. This is not a request for proposals. This announcement is being issued in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineering (Public Law 92-582) and implemented in the Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FAR) Part 36. Architectural and Engineering (A&E) firms permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering are requested to send two copies of an SF 330 (3/2013 Edition) and CD from qualified and eligible 100% SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.  The VA Medical Center (CVAMC) in Coatesville, PA is seeking professional A&E services for Project No. 542-12-106,  Correct Electrical Deficiencies Phase 2 . The consultant shall provide all professional A&E services necessary to develop complete drawings, specifications, cost estimates, project phasing, site visits and construction period administration associated with renovating and modernizing all antiquated electrical systems throughout the CVAMC Campus within the constraints of the construction budget consistent with the Veterans Affairs (VA s) project team goals as prioritized during project meetings and field surveys.  Modernization will include, but is not limited to circuit breaker panels, motor starter equipment, proper type and sizing of wire, automatic transfer switches, bonding and grounding. Conduct preliminary project scope meetings and site survey investigations to develop the necessary elements for conceptual layout schemes with proposed alternatives consistent with the VA s project team goals as prioritized during preliminary project meetings, field surveys and studies. The A&E firm shall assess the CVAMC with CVAMC electricians input and investigate the entire campus thoroughly to make a long-term, all-encompassing electrical retrofit of FPE panels and the associated wires, motors and motor starters, ATS s and ancillary equipment. These associated wires should be replaced because the FPE breakers don t trip. This causes the wire to overheat and eventually causing jackets and the copper to be brittle. The amperes then are amplified due to poor connection/conductivity. Upon replacement of the breaker panels, the existing wire will not be able to be warrantied or even deemed safe. Even more critical are the higher load motor starters whose coil contacts are often highly pitted, drawing higher amps, and do not have replacement parts. Motors running at continuously high amps suffer from wire and insulation degradation.  The work to be conducted shall include, but not be limited to:
Replacement and removal (R/R) of all Federal pacific Electric equipment throughout.
R/R of all outdated, undersized, and non-commercial grade wiring as in building 9.
R/R all overloaded electrical panels as in building 12, and 138.
Inspect grounding and bonding on internal transformers and R/R.
R/R outdated lightening protection to include fencing at substation.
R/R aged ATS s as in building 10.
R/R, repair, and/or rewire conduits through garage door Oval 1 access point.
A/E Assessment is to begin within 30 days of award of contract. 

In order to minimize patient safety and inconvenience, and maximize a minimal down-time there are several critical points to be adhered to:
No power will be disconnected unless approved by the COR in order to ensure that life safety and functionality to the patient ward is considered the highest priority. Frequent after-hours work must be conducted and must be highly coordinated with the COR, the Electricians, and the CVAMC medical staff.
There will be multiple locations that the electrical panel box can remain and the internal breakers and blocks can be replaced. This will save many hours of labor, allow a new internal package, minimize greatly down-time and inconvenience, and save the CVAMC a great amount of money. 
Throughout the entire project, an applicably sized portable generator will power the load (the facility or individual circuits) in order to minimize time without power.
The CVAMC is an open campus with 450 live-in patients and extensive out-patients. The contractor will be thoroughly briefed and responsible on the need for patient safety with respect to the use of tools.
Contractors will need to remain highly flexible to rearrange scheduling around mealtimes, high-traffic scenarios, inspections, medicine distribution, etc. An extensive partnership and coordination must be designed between the contractor, the Contracting Officer, the CVAMC engineering staff, and the CVAMC medical staff. 
Contractors will provide emergency escape lighting when applicable.
Contractors will pay very specific attention to removing power to life support systems and critical safety devices.
Contractors will warranty that all circuits are properly marked and tested.
ALL work will comply with National Electrical Code (NEC) National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 70E Standards for Electrical Safety in the Workplace, and NFPA 99 Health Care Facility Codes.
All circuits affected will be annotated on blueprints to include as-builts. Three (3) hard copies and three (3) CD s will be provided prior to completion of project. 
All abandoned wire, starters, and related equipment will be recycled by the contractor and submit a receipt as proof. Empty or abandoned conduit will have the covers removed at junction boxes and applicable elbows and conduit marked as empty. 
The contractor must provide their own storage. The CVAMC has a small field where a construction trailer can be placed only for the duration of the project. 
Work to be performed between the hours of 7am thru 5pm Monday through Friday. Any disruption of power to the facility must be coordinated through the aforementioned management. It is understood that there will be the need for frequent after-hours work which must be extensively coordinated.
The A&E shall obtain all environmental and other necessary permits that would be required prior to construction commencing.
The A&E shall base their design to meet the following sustainable energy requirements:
USGBC LEED: Design elements to qualify for LEED Silver, with no formal certification required. 
Executive Order 13514
EPACT 2005
EISA 2007
VA HVAC Design Manual
VA Sustainable Design & Energy Reduction Manual (April 2010 or later)
All works are to be in accordance with National Electrical Code (NEC), Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospital Organizations (JCHAO) and the National Fire Prevention Administration (NFPA) codes.
Drawings containing sensitive areas and/or critical infrastructure such as security systems, IT server room, telecomm/data closets, etc., must be encrypted (FIPS 140-2 standard) during transmissions and at rest when outside of VA owned or managed facilities. Paper copies should not be left unattended and secured at all times when not in use (e.g., locked drawers and offices). 
Contractor will be required to comply with physical security requirements to include  checking in with the VA Police or VA sponsor/COR each time they come on site to perform services and obtaining a VA compliant ID badge which must be worn at all times while on VA property.
Contractor must be escorted by authorized VA personnel at all times while performing work in sensitive IT areas (i.e., telecommunications/data closets and server room).

The scope of work includes but is not limited to the following: Investigative work must be completed within the scope of this project. The design must be completed within 365 days. The A&E shall provide the services indicated in this Overview, Supplement A, Supplement B and Supplement C.  These services will be provided in distinct phases: 

Conceptual   Preliminary User Group Meetings & Field Surveys 
30% Submittal   Schematics 
60% Submittal    DD  Design Development 
90% Submittal    CD  Construction Documents 
100% Submittal   Bid [Final] Documents
