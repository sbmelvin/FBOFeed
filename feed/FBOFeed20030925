The contractor will be responsible for providing transcription of a variety of specialized medical reports dictated by patient care physicians and other authorized medical professionals.  These specialized reports may be categorized into four groups: medical reports, diagnostic reports, pathologic reports and letters to outside physicians.  Additionally, the contractor will be responsible for assigning ICD-9-CM codes to relative information dictated in medical reports.  The estimated volume for a single twelve (12) month period is as follows:  Medical Reports and Letters Volume, 28,500,000 words, 26,000 reports/letters; Diagnostic Reports Volume, 6,200 reports, 17,546 pages; Pathologic Reports Volume, 18,960 reports; Coding Volume, 26,700 codes.

The RIS receives orders from the hospital information system and sends corresponding reports back to the hospital information system through an interface.  Radiologists and other Imaging Sciences clinicians dictate results of imaging procedures into a Dictaphone Digital Dictation System and those reports will be transcribed by a contractor directly into RIS.  Reports created in the RIS are sent to the dictating clinician for review and finalization.  Final results are sent to the hospital information system through an interface following electronic review, verification and electronic signature of the responsible clinician.  The estimated volume for a single twelve (12) month period is as follows: 57,850 reports.  The period of performance will be for a basic twelve (12) month period, with options to renew for five (5) additional twelve (12) month periods.

As such, it is the Government’s belief that only Appleton Marine, and/or their authorized distributors have the capability of supplying this Main Fall Winch and related items while guaranteeing the same form, fit, and function with existing equipment.  The nonavailability of technical and engineering data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, therefore it is intended to award a sole-source fixed-price purchase order to Appleton Marine and/or one of their authorized distributors, no later than 15 October 2003.  However, other sources can submit information detailing their capabilities to  provide this particular Main Fall Winch and related items.

This information MUST BE RECEIVED IN THIS OFFICE WITHIN 5 CALENDAR DAYS FROM THE DATE THIS NOTICE IS PUBLISHED.  Information received after this deadline shall not be considered for this acquisition.  The submission of this data for review does NOT impede the award of this purchase order, but will qualify acceptable submissions for follow on acquisitions.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Request For Quotation (RFQ) Number HSCG40-04-Q-50001 shall be available for download on or about September 26, 2003.

<DESC>This acquisition is to increase the scope of Contract No. N68335-02-D-0023 with Northrop Grumman, Sykesville, MD for the Advanced Recovery Control System (ARC).  The scope increase is for a VAC  "Bench Tester" and the incorporation of the EA-18G aircraft arresting gear parameters into the VAC System.   This bench tester would supply electrical, pneumatic and static force loads.  In addition, the bench tester would exercise the VAC system and sub-systems to ensure proper manufacturing and software loading was accomplished prior to delivery.  The currently proposed VAC Bench Tester will not simulate an aircraft carrier arrestment, but will simulate the electrical and pneumatic loads.   With an upgraded ARC Bench Tester, the Government will be able to conduct extensive reliability testing on the VAC system and subsystems in a more realistic carrier environment.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Any interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete  this proposed increase to the scope of the contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The point of contact is June Manganello at 732) 323-2735 or E-Mail: june.manganello@navy.mil.  Note: 22

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing Request for Proposals Number R-CHI-00677 in support of the HUD's Headquarters, Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), Affordable Housing Research and Technology Division      (AHRTD). Five (5) contracts are expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation to provide studies related to the HUD programs known as Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing (PATH). This procurement is being issued on a negotiated basis. The 5 contracts expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation will cover the following PATH categories and brief descriptions: PATH 9 - Creating Whole House System Solutions -----While many research and intellectual groups have loosely defined the concept of the 'whole house,' most of these have only suggested broad changes in the ways that individual home
building firms function and the home building industry is structured. The PATH Roadmap, however, has suggested the current industry must go beyond individual changes and into advancing wholistic approaches to designing, constructing, and maintaining homes, or systems thinking. This project will define both technically and contextually the technical and operations components of a whole house. This involves reviewing past      examples of whole house approaches, and assembling categories for the technological systems necessary to accomplish this concept. PATH 11 - Durability/Moisture: Applying System Solutions----- One of the goals of the Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing (PATH) is to increase the durability of housing while maintaining affordability. The presence of moisture is perhaps the most significant durability issue to be addressed in the design of homes.Moisture needs to be looked at as an aspect of the whole house and its construction as well. To approach this, a comprehensive plan shall be created as to how to coordinate research and other activities leading to better moisture resistance in single family housing that looks at the
whole house aspects of the problem. PATH 12 - Whole House Research: Disentangling Utilities----- New subsystems in housing-like indoor plumbing, electric wiring,central HVAC-have been simply "added to" the home rather than "integrated
into it. This problem has become critical as more systems are panelized; installing utility systems in conventional stud construction is awkward and often ends up compromising     structural or insulating integrity. This project focuses on how to integrate utilities into these building systems or disentangle them from these building systems to best achieve more      affordable housing. PATH 13 - Panel's Research I: Wall Panels Benchmark and Performance Requirements----- The broad purpose of this project is to define what panelized wall systems
are currently available and their technical specifications, how do they perform and in what applications are they most used, and what are the standard performance criteria that all panelized wall systems need to meet in order to integrate with existing methods of construction. This project involves reviewing all panelized wall systems currently on the market, assembling categories for the technical product specifications necessary to identify similarities and differences. After the literature review and analysis, a detailed study of the conflicting technical
performance attributes (e.g., structural performance vs. weight limitations vs. material durability, etc.) must be performed. Suggested parameters for these attributes will also be
developed. PATH 14 - Tools for Streamlining the Code Enforcement Documentation and Communication Process----- This project will examine the tools currently available to code enforcement offices, tools currently available in industries with similar requirements, and potential tools which could be developed for use by code enforcement offices to document their uses and potential. The solicitation package will provide additional information regarding the above PATH projects. This is a new acquisition. There are no current contractors performing this work under individual contracts nor historic data is available concerning these individual contracts nor any other PATH programs.-----This solicitation is total set aside for small business
concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 (engineering research and development laboratories or services) ,and the size standard is 500
employees, average for the last three years. See Numbered Note 1. Five individual cost-reimbursement type contracts are expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation,however the government reserves the right to award the most appropriate type. Four out of the five contracts are to be completed within 12 months, and one (1) out of the five (5) contracts is to be completed within 8 months. Solicitation package will be available on or about 15 days from this notification and proposals will be due on or about 45 days from this announcement. For a solicitation package you may write to Alfredo Valentin, Contract Specialist, HUD, Contracting
Branch, 77 W. Jackson Blvd, Room 2517, Chicago, Illinois 60604-3507 or you may contact Alfredo Valentin at 312-886-2760 Extension 2509. You may also send a fax request to
     312-353-8965 or E-mail Alfredo_Valentin@hud.gov (use underscored key). Please make

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to procure selected spare parts managed by the DSCP, Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC), and Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR).  Under this effort, called the Strategic Material Sourcing/Rapid Manufacturing Initiative (SMS/RMI), parts have been arranged into various market baskets that group items based on their shared attributes.  Federal Supply Groups (FSGs) to be included in this effort include: 10, 17, 20, 25, 34, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 53, 62, and 81.  

The market baskets are comprised of a mixture of high and low demand items, and consider other industry attributes such as similar manufacturing processes and/or materials, and prospective competitive representation.  Specific information associated with this initiative will be available at http://www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/smsrmi/ .

The resultant contract(s) terms will provide for indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity types with an anticipated eleven (11) year contract term, consisting of a 5-year base period and three (3) 2-year option periods.  All items to be furnished under the resultant contract(s) will be ordered by issuance of delivery orders.    Each contract entered into under this prospective program will include surge and wartime readiness sustainment requirements.   We anticipate the use of Electronic Commerce. 

This Presolicitation Notice has been designated as a partial small business set-aside on the Fed Biz Ops for identification purposes only. This identification is to draw attention to both small and large business. Commensurate with shared attributes and competitive representation specific to each market basket, it is anticipated that respective market baskets will be identified as either a Hub Zone, 8A, Veteran Owned, Veteran Disabled, Woman Owned, Total set aside, Partial set aside or Unrestricted. Market baskets identified as unrestricted will be limited to those requirements where there is no reasonable expectation that at least two responsible small business offers will be received; as substantiated by prior experience, market research, and industry feedback.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

1. Overview: AF 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, chapter 2, allows weapons simulators to be used to qualify personnel with weapons. Weapons simulators are needed at all Air Combat Command (ACC) bases to provide continuing weapons qualification training when small arms ranges are closed for repair, ammunition is unavailable, or for northern tier bases when weather prohibits their use. During FY03 and FY04, 14 bases within ACC will be closing their ranges for major renovations. These renovations will last from weeks to months, according to the level of work being performed. Considering ACC Combat Arms sections annually provide weapons qualification training to over 75K people, the lose of even a few days of training time can directly effect ours Wing’s arming ability. Weapons simulators can also be used to provide unique training opportunities for specific missions. Units can use the systems to conduct judgmental training by the use of shoot-don't shoot scenarios or, by the use of authoring stations, they can create localized training scenarios to provide realistic training. AFI 36-2226 mandates simulator weapons must perform in all respects like actual weapons. To meet the need of the command and AFI 36-2226 requirements, the following requirements were developed: 

2. Weapons requirements to be included in the price of the system: 2.1. System must have 10 M16A2 rifles, 10 M9 pistols, and 10 M4 carbines with flat top universal rails.  2.2. Weapons must be capable of using owner installed optics, laser and inferred pointers as they were designed without interfering with system operations or affecting warranties. 2.3. Weapons and system used to control weapons, must use accurate and validated ballistics for each type of weapon. Ballistic data must have been previously validated by another federal agency.  The integration of another companies validated ballistic data into the training system will satisfy the Air Force’s validation requirement’s under this section. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:  There must be a high degree of variation in ballistic effects for different types/sizes of ammunition.  While some ammunition may have a relatively flat trajectory over typical shooting distances, others may have a pronounced arc, forcing the shooter to learn to compensate.  The most obvious example of this is the fact that a pistol does not shoot like a rifle.   A more subtle example involves the way some ammunition drifts during its flyout.  This drift causes the projectile to move left or right based on the direction of its spin.  When firing a weapon such as the 40mm MK19, this drift must be modeled, if the shooter is to be expected to ever fire the real weapon accurately.  In addition a high-fidelity simulator must teach the shooter to compensate for the effects of wind.  This windage effect is not only a matter of wind speed and direction, but also of firing distance.  In order to correctly calculate this effect, ballistics must be factored in.  Another function of ballistics is to terminate the flight of the projectile at the proper distance.  In the absence of correct ballistics, the projectile will fly to the incorrect distance or virtually forever.  Each of these computations allows for the proper adjustment to the flight path of that round, given the amount of time, distance, and wind that has elapsed since the round left the weapon.  The system uses that information, along with a highly precise laser detection system to provide characteristics matching that of real ammunition in real weapons.   Additionally, basic trajectory data is provided at one meter intervals in ballistic tables from launch to the terminal range of a given projectiles trajectory.  Unit effects data is provided at range increments appropriate to the weapon involved.  The unit effects to a constant height are used for constant height and to a constant range.  Unit effects to a constant height are used for horizontal targets; unit effects to a constant range are used for vertical targets.  Ballistic data used in the calculations include:  ballistic air density, ballistic air temperature, ballistic range wind, ballistic vertical wind, ballistic cross wind, altitude of the meteorological datum plane, grid declination, non-standard meteorological data, thrust factors, base burn time, weight of projectile, twist of rifling, diameter of projectile, center of gravity of projectile, and axial moment of inerta.  All data integrated into the ballistic equations per weapon type and projectile type for calculations.  Small arms training systems must use this data on a per weapon type projectile type to accurately calculate the terminal point of the projectile on all targets based on the vertical and horizontal range. SMALL ARMS TRAJECTORIES AND VALIDATION:  Data calculated are basic trajectories at one-meter range increments to the given weapon’s maximum range, plus unit effects data.  The weapons covered are the M16A2, M249, M9, M203, MK19, and M1200.  During validation the following data is measured by placing a simulated target at one meter and then moving it to the maximum range at one-meter increments and   taking measurements of the simulated strike of the projectile at each increment.  Once this is done a comparison of the same data that is in government or commercially available ballistic data is conducted to ensure that they match within an acceptable range.  In the case of one of the systems the mean is + or - .0001.  2.4. Weapons must operate and function the same as actual service weapons. System operator must have the ability, at any time during scenarios, to inject real time malfunctions/stoppages. 2.5. Air supplied to the weapons must be supplied by a light weight, easily portable, low noise, air compressor that can be locally repaired or replaced with an off-the-shelf model, if needed. 2.6. When a weapon becomes unserviceable, to minimize training interruption the immediate availability of replacement weapons (within 24 hours) from the vendor is mandatory. 2.7. At a minimum, all weapons must have a one-year warranty on parts, labor, shipping and handling. 2.8. All weapons must have a minimum life expectancy of 225,000 rounds. 2.9. At a minimum, weapons and supporting systems must maintain a minimum in-commission rate of 85%. 

3. Simulator requirements to be included in the price of the system: 3.1. Software and licenses must be assigned per system, not location or individual. Each system will be equipped with original copies of all programs used in the system in the event a system must be reloaded. 3.2. The system must be a complete turnkey operation to include all power cords, cables, and other items to make the system operational. 3.3. System must be able to operate on European or US electrical standards without the use of additional external transformers. 3.4. System must come equipped with a 19-inch color CRT monitor or a 17-inch color flat panel monitor. 3.5. Each system must have a built in capability to edit any and all scenarios or courses of fire (COF) used on the system.

<DESC>The General Services Administration is concerned by the limited interest demonstrated for this procurement from certified HUBZone small businesses.  As described in solicitation amendment 0001, a third and final site visit has been scheduled for 10:00 AM local time on June 27, 2003 at the Foley U.S. Courthouse in Albany.  The agency will carefully consider the attendance of prospective HUBZone offerors as an indication of interest in this procurement.  The set-aside will be reevaluated should the contracting officer determine that the government is unlikely to receive bids from two or more HUBZone certified firms with average annual gross receipts not more than $12 million.  Prospective offerors also are urged to carefully consider the allowable level of subcontracting for this procurement.  No more than 75% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel may be spent on employees from other than HUBZone small business concerns.  Please immediately direct any additional questions to the points of contact listed below in order that this procurement may proceed in an orderly and efficient manner.  The General Services Administration appreciates the interest already expressed and is committed to providing ample additional opportunity before altering the set-aside.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has the stated mission to reduce the burden of neurological disease—a burden borne by every age group, by every segment of society, by people all over the world. To support this mission, NINDS: Conducts, fosters, coordinates, and guides research on the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of neurological disorders and stroke, and supports basic research in related scientific areas. Provides grants-in-aid to public and private institutions and individuals in fields related to its areas of interest, including research project, program project, and research center grants. Provides individual and institutional fellowships to increase scientific expertise in neurological fields. Operates a program of contracts for the funding of research and research support efforts in selected areas of institute need. Conducts a diversified program of intramural and collaborative research in its own laboratories, branches, and clinics. Collects and disseminates research information related to neurological disorders.

NINDS has targeted Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) for a pilot program in accelerated therapeutics development. SMA is a devastating neurological disease of childhood for which no effective treatment is currently available. SMA causes degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem, leading to muscle weakness and, in severe forms of the disease, death. It is the most severe of the common genetic neurological diseases and is the leading heritable cause of infant death. SMA is an ideal candidate for targeted therapeutics development. It is caused by the loss of function of a known gene, SMN1. Thus, there are tractable strategies for developing treatments based on replacement of the lost function. Multiple therapeutic avenues are available, including drug development, gene therapy and stem cell therapy.

NINDS’ research goal for Spinal Muscular Atrophy is to efficiently translate a mechanistic understanding of SMA into a testable therapy suitable for clinical trials. The NINDS strategy for achieving its research goal is to fund parallel therapeutic pathways in a rapid milestone-driven process that will identify a promising therapeutic candidate. This project will require a high level of scientific expertise and experience on the part of the contractor. Furthermore, efficient progress will involve an unusual degree of acceleration and integration of multiple research projects, and thus success will also require that the contractor use creativity and flexibility in applying that scientific expertise. 

It is anticipated that one award may be made for a period of four years in September 2003.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division, Energetic Materials Branch (MNME) seeks commercial quotations for a highly-specialized pulsed-laser spectroscopic diagnostic system.  The following paragraphs explain the minimum technical specifications/requirements for the tunable excitation laser component of this system, consisting of a Nd:YAG pump laser and a wavelength-tunable Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO).  

Basic Configuration:  In this paragraph, system components to be provided by the vendor are discussed. Those to be provided by AFRL/MNME are identified as “government furnished equipment (GFE).”  The GFE will not be made available to the vendor for testing.  The output of a Nd:YAG pump laser will be used to drive a wavelength-tunable Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) with both items residing on an optical table (GFE).  Vendor will provide any internal or external beam steering optics required to redirect the Nd:YAG output for a secondary function (relay imaging focusing onto a target; these relay imaging optics and the target are GFE) without mechanical displacement of either the Nd:YAG pump laser or the OPO.  Sufficient internal or external beam dumps will be provided for safe operation of the system.  Vendor will supply any interface computer card required for communication between the laser system’s electronic control unit and an IBM-compatible personal computer (GFE).  This computer will run a Windows 2000 compatible software package to control the function of, and collect output wavelength and other performance data from the laser system.  The system will include all power supplies, power cables, and control cables required for operation with any combination of the following electrical services:  208 VAC three phase, 30 amp, 60 Hz; 240 VAC single phase, 40 amp, 60 Hz; 110 VAC single phase, 20 amp, 60 Hz operation.  

Mechanical Dimensions:  Vendor will include a mechanical sketch of the entire system with correct external dimensions and relative component placements in their quotation.  The Nd:YAG laser, OPO, and beam steering optics must fit onto a 4 foot x 10 foot section of the optical table.  Free space within this 4x10 foot section will be reserved for the GFE relay imaging optical system, which is proposed to occupy a 6 inch wide by 12 inch tall corridor extending straight out along the Nd:YAG fundamental output port; functionally equivalent alternative placements of these relay imaging optics proposed by the Vendor will also be considered.  Due to extreme lab space limitations smaller power supplies (shorter than 30 inches) capable of fitting underneath the optical table are desirable.  

Anticipated Environmental Variations:  The laser system will be required to operate in a laboratory environment with poor temperature and humidity control.  Typical temperature variations during working hours can cover a 6 degree Celcius (°C) range, with occasional variations over a 10 °C range also possible.  Vendor will clearly state the temperature ranges over which the following System Performance and Warranty requirements will be met.  Vendor is invited to describe any special design or manufacturing considerations for their system which may mitigate against potential problems caused by the anticipated environmental variations.  

System Performance:  Vendor will provide “typical” test data from previously manufactured laser systems for all of the following technical requirements for the purpose of source selection.  Vendor will provide actual test data from the laser system built for AFRL/MNME for all of the following performance requirements as a deliverable.  The Nd:YAG laser will operate at 10 Hz and will provide at least 1.5 Joules per pulse at the 1064 nanometer (nm) fundamental for the secondary function; higher pulse energies are desirable.  Short-term 1064 nm pulse energy variations will not exceed ± 3 % for 99 % of the pulses over any 1 hour period.  Long-term (8 hour) average 1064 nm pulse energy drift will not exceed ± 3 %.  Duration of the 1064 nm pulse must fall within the 5 to 10 nanosecond (ns) range.  Timing jitter between the 1064 nm pulse and an externally accessible TTL trigger output signal must not exceed ± 1 ns.  The 1064 nm laser linewidth will not exceed 0.003 reciprocal-centimeters (cm-1).  The 1064 nm beam near field intensity spatial profile will approximate as closely as possible a “top hat” or “flat top” distribution (essential for the secondary application), with over 99 % of the beam energy contained within a 1 cm radius from the beam center.  The pointing stability of the 355 nm OPO pump beam will not exceed ± 30 micro-radians.  The OPO will provide tunable output covering the 450 nm to 1700 nm wavelength range; a small tuning gap near 710 nm is acceptable, but the absence of such a gap is preferred.  Vendor is invited to propose a wavelength extension option to provide for tunable output into the ultraviolet spectral region.  The OPO will provide pulse energies of at least:  50 milli-Joules (mJ) at 500 nm, 50 mJ at 600 nm, 30 mJ at 800 nm, 10 mJ at 1000 nm, and 5 mJ at 1600 nm.  Short-term OPO pulse energy variations will not exceed ± 10 % for 99 % of the pulses over any 1 hour period.  Long-term (8 hour) average OPO pulse energy drift will not exceed ± 10 %.  Duration of the OPO pulse must not exceed 10 ns.  Timing jitter between the OPO pulse and an externally accessible TTL trigger output signal must not exceed ± 2 ns.  The OPO linewidth must not exceed 0.08 cm-1 throughout the tuning range.  The diameter of the OPO beam (99 % beam energy) will not exceed 1 cm.  The divergence of the OPO beam will not exceed 2 milli-radians.  

Hardware/Software Manuals:  Vendor will include pricing for all technical manuals necessary to operate the proposed hardware and software.   

Serviceability and Warranty:  Vendor is invited to describe any special design or manufacturing considerations for their system which may reduce or eliminate the need for on-site service visits.  Vendor will clearly describe which parts are covered under the standard Warranty, the duration of the standard Warranty, and their estimated daily labor rate for an on-site service visit.  Vendor is invited to propose as an option an extended Warranty plan which will cover all parts, labor, and travel charges for a limited time period.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 0001 is to increase the quantity from one system to three systems (rooms 2801, 4301 and 4101), extend the date for receipt of proposals, respond to vendor questions received to date and establish a date/time for a site visit.  QUESTION #1:  In reviewing the solicitation SP4700-03-T-0049 I noticed that you have specified 2 NEC 42MP3 Plasma Displays (PX-42VM3A). As the video conferencing vendor for the House of Representatives, I have sold numerous 42MP3 units over the past 2 years and I have purchased each one from Electrograph. The 42MP3 unit has been discontinued for several months. The replacement unit is the NEC 42VP4. I spoke with Vince Shuster (Zone Manager, Electrograph) and he confirmed this as fact. Will DLA accept the NEC 42VP4 as a substitution item for the 42MP3?  ANSWER:  Yes, provided they are of equal or better quality.  QUESTION #2:  This is fairly in-depth proposal. Was there an incumbent company who prepared this solicitation, or was this design done by the Manufacturer Polycom?  ANSWER:  We did have assistance preparing the proposal by a technical expert.  QUESTION #3:  Will there be an opportunity for a meeting on this proposal, so that our Engineers can double check the specifications on the design to make sure it is viable and all the pieces are in place? If so, when would be a convenient time to do a site walk through, Thurs (9/25), or Fri (9/26)?  ANSWER:  Yes, we are available for a site visit on Friday, 26 Sep 03, 9:00 a.m.  Please be in the main lobby at 9:00 a.m. for escort to the Conference Rooms.  QUESTION #4:  Since this proposal is due on a Sunday (9/28), is there a possibility of an extension to Monday (9/29)?  ANSWER:  Yes, we can reestablish the closing date/time as 29 Sep 03, 2:00 p.m.  QUESTION #5:  Can we do a site survey?  ANSWER:  See response to question #3 above.  QUESTION #6:  The Project Scope says 8 ceiling speakers, but the Audio Sound System description says 4.  Please clarify.  ANSWER:  There should be six ceiling microphones and four ceiling speakers.  QUESTION #7:  The Maintenance section says installation by Polycom and warranty through SPS and AVAYS.  Please confirm this refers to only the Polycom equipment and all other equipment is the responsibility of successful bidder, and please define what SPS and AVAYS stands for or who they are.  ANSWER:  Warranty covers all equipment, installation and cabling.  A Polycom engineer works with SPS.  SPS handles all interfacing with equipment warranties.  SPS stands for Strategic Products and Services and AVAYA Communications is their business partner.  QUESTION #8:  The projector brand name is given as HP, but there is no model or specifications given.  Please provide either the specific model or specifications we should bid on.  ANSWER:  HP Digital Projector Model VP6100 Series (1,500-2,000 Lumens).  QUESTION # 9:  After reviewing the pre solicitation notice, would like to respond with a responsible proposal, however, based on information given we are requesting a site survey and or building drawings and documentation to estimate installation and labor requirements.  If you could please advise It would be greatly appreciated.  ANSWER:  See response to question #3 above.  QUESTION #10:  Do you have specific part numbers for the Crestron Isys unit and Crestron wireless module?  ANSWER:  We are looking for either these units or something similar that will allow the whole system to work and be compatible with Polycom or Tandberg conferencing equipment.  QUESTION #11:  Do you also need a quote for Polycom’s onsite maintenance?  ANSWER:  Yes.  QUESTION #12:  What are the dimensions of the room – the amount of cable required seems like a lot.  ANSWER:  Circular, roughly 15 feet diameter.  QUESTION:  The part number for the Polycom SoundStation is not valid – what specific model are you looking for?  ANSWER:  VTX or equal.  Offers are due 29 September 2003, 2:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.  Delivery may be made to Andrew T. McNamara Headquarters Complex, 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Suite 1145, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6220.  Please contact Ms. Brenda Geist (brenda.geist@dla.mil) for information regarding the solicitation.  This requirement is based on an ALL OR NONE basis.  Facsimile proposal or electronic proposals will be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Inertial Reference Units (IRUs) for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Project of NASA/GSFC.  SDO is the first mission under the Living with a Star (LWS) Program as part of the Sun Earth Connection (SEC).  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun and enhance our understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow on to the highly successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. SDO will be in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and with an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will also have a mission life requirement of 5 years, with a goal of 10 years.  SDO will be a three-axis stabilized satellite with spacecraft attitude knowledge requirements of &lt; 10 arcsec and jitter requirement of less than 5 arcsec with a maximum expected rate range of approximately 2 deg/sec.  The observatory will operate on 28 +/-7 V dc power.	 The SDO Project is interested in single fault tolerant, 3-axis inertial reference units and pertinent life test data. Requested information is as follows:  MECHANICAL {Mass (kg), Size Envelope (cm), Vibration levels for qualification and acceptance (Grms), Description of mechanical interface/mounting (drawings requested)} ELECTRICAL {Description of electrical interface and voltage protection features, Description of power interface(s), Peak power consumption (W), Steady state power consumption (W), Input voltage range (+/-V),  Inrush current (A)}  THERMAL {(General interface, survival temperature range (deg C), Operational temperature range (deg C), Thermal dissipation (W) during steady state operation and any other significant mode.} PERFORMANCE: {Rate range(s) (deg/sec), measurement resolution for each range (deg/sec), Rate saturation output/output data outside the rate range (polarity signal or invalid data), scale factor, scale factor stability (PPM or %FS), scale factor linearity (PPM), scale factor asymmetry (PPM), bias (deg/sec), bias stability (deg/hr), bias temperature sensitivity (deg/sec/deg C), random drift (deg/sec), standard deviation of angle random walk (deg/hr^(1/2)), standard deviation of rate random walk (deg/hr^(3/2)), magnetic sensitivity} DATA {Type(s) of command and data interface available, Description of input commands and output telemetry (Command and Data Interface Control Document requested), Update rate of the IRU output (Hz), Type of rate output (Ex: whole angle, incremental angle, rate measurement)} RELIABILITY {EEE Parts classification (Class A/B), Mean Time Between Failure, State of component development.

The AIBU is a major component of the F-16 C/D avionics systems. Radar, electronic warfare, navigation and communications depend upon the proper operation of the AIBU to coordinate signal emissions and receptions. If the AIBU should fail, the pilot could not operate the radar, electronic warfare, navigation, and communication systems at the same time.  The item is critical for ensuring reduced vulnerability to threats and increased survivability in a combat operational environment.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes the fulfillment of Public Law 2319 and is the periodic announcement of a Qualification Requirement, which is available for the manufacture of the C/D Band Antenna, part number 16VE221-1, NSN: 5895-01-146-9283WF.  The C/D band Antenna is a major component of the F-16 A/B/C/D defensive avionics systems in that it receives threat radar signals and sends them to the ALR-69 or ALR-56M for signal analysis. This allows proper situation awareness for the F-16 pilot in a high-threat air defense area and activation of the correct electronic warfare systems to defeat the threat and allow mission completion. If the C/D band Antenna should fail, the pilot would not receive proper threat radar signals and the on-board defensive electronic warfare systems would not work correctly. The item is critical for ensuring reduced vulnerability to threats and increased survivability in a combat operational environment.

<SUBJECT>79 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  
The following items are under consideration: SKILCRAFT Savvy Cleaning Products (7930-00-NIB-0144 – BK-14 Heavy Duty Degreasing Detergent – 32 oz; 7930-00-NIB-0145 – BK-14 Heavy Duty Degreasing Detergent – 1 gal; 7930-00-NIB-0146 – BK-14 Heavy Duty Degreasing Detergent – 5 gal; 7930-00-NIB-0147 – BK-14 Heavy Duty Degreasing Detergent – 55 gal; 7930-00-NIB-0176 – BK-1260 General Purpose Disinfectant Detergent – 32 oz; 7930-00-NIB-0177 – BK-1260 General Purpose Disinfectant Detergent – 1 gal; 7930-00-NIB-0178 – BK-1260 General Purpose Disinfectant Detergent – 5 gal; 7930-00-NIB-0179 – BK-260 General Purpose Disinfectant Detergent – 55 gal; 7930-00-NIB-0127 0 TR-43 Commercial Vehicle Cleaner – 1 gal; 7930-00-NIB-0142 – TR-43 Commercial Vehicle Cleaner – 5 gal; 7930-00-NIB-0143 – TR-43 Commercial Vehicle Cleaner – 55 gal). In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

(End of clause) 

5352.242-9500 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS (MAY 2003)	

(a) Security Requirements.  The Contractor shall adhere to the installation security requirements as provided for in AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management, and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Supplement to AFI 31-601. When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the Contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, as applicable.
 (b) The Contractor shall submit a letter to the Contracting Officer specifying the personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form O-111 requesting a Contractor Identification Badge or vehicle pass. The Contractor shall submit a USAFA Form O-111 on each employee requiring access to an installation. The Contracting Officer or Sponsoring Official will endorse the request and forward a copy to the issuing base pass and registration office or Security Forces for processing. The individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original Form O-111 to the issuing base pass and registration office or Security Forces for processing. When reporting to the registration office to obtain a vehicle pass, the authorized Contractor individual(s) should also provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and any documents required by local Security Forces procedures.
(c) In lieu of USAFA Form O-111, Application For Personnel And Vehicle Passes To Work Under Air Force Contract, or a temporary AF FM 75, Visitor Pass, the Contractor shall obtain Contractor Identification Badges and/or vehicle passes for all Contractor personnel who make frequent visits (i.e., more than 7 visits per calendar year) to perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their Contractor Identification Badges in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the Contractor’s employees from accessing the installation(s) until Contractor Identification Badges and vehicle passes are obtained. 
(d) During performance of the contract, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site. Credentials and vehicle passes shall be returned to the issuing office within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.
(e) Background Checks.  All employees of the Contractor shall comply with USAFA security requirements while on the installation.  Prior to Contractor personnel working on USAFA installation properties, the Contractor and all Contractor personnel shall agree to USAFA conducting a criminal background check. USAFA Security Forces shall conduct the criminal background check accessing the appropriate state crime information center and national crime information center database to include, but not limited to any state listed by the employee as current and past addresses.  
 
(f) Convictions.  Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years involving violence, weapons, explosives, physical assault, espionage, illegal drugs, theft or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require removal of the employee from the effort under this contract.  For convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the Contractor may recommend retaining the employee.  Any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years involving the same offenses as stated above shall constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately remove the employee from effort under this contract.  Employees removed by the Contracting Officer may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA.  The Contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. The Contracting Officer shall be immediately notified of all such cases, and the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to restrict the employee’s use on this contract until the case is resolved.  This action does not relieve the Contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.

(g) Warrants.  If during the course of Contractor Identification Badge processing, any Contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding the warrant. However, the Contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. The Contracting Officer shall be immediately notified by the prime contractor of all such cases, and the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to restrict the employee’s use on this contract until the case is resolved.

(h) Prior to use of an employee on this contract, the Contractor shall validate that the employee is a United States citizen or holds a valid resident alien status. If the employee is not a United States citizen, the Contractor shall validate the individual’s proof of alien registration with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service. The Contractor will cooperate in the Security Forces’ processing of its employees for Contractor Identification Badges for access to the USAFA under this contract. 

(i) If this contract requires that any of the Contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check (NAC) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check.  In that event, the Contractor agrees to fully cooperate in the processing of the NAC background check.  Those employees shall also be subject to the background check required for issuing a Contractor Identification Badge, as described above.

(j) Removal of Contractor Employees.  The Government reserves the right to direct the removal of an employee for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons.  This action does not relieve the Contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.
(k) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the Contractor Access Identification, the prime Contractor shall ensure that all Contractor Identification Badges and vehicle passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office within 21 calendar days.
(l) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of payment.
(m) All references to Contractor above include the Contractor and Subcontractors.
(End of clause)

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division, Energetic Materials Branch (MNME) seeks commercial quotations for a highly-specialized pulsed-laser spectroscopic diagnostic system.  The following paragraphs explain the minimum technical specifications/requirements for the tunable excitation laser component of this system, consisting of a Nd:YAG pump laser and a wavelength-tunable Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO).  

Basic Configuration:  In this paragraph, system components to be provided by the vendor are discussed. Those to be provided by AFRL/MNME are identified as “government furnished equipment (GFE).”  The GFE will not be made available to the vendor for testing.  The output of a Nd:YAG pump laser will be used to drive a wavelength-tunable Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) with both items residing on an optical table (GFE).  Vendor will provide any internal or external beam steering optics required to redirect the Nd:YAG output for a secondary function (relay imaging focusing onto a target; these relay imaging optics and the target are GFE) without mechanical displacement of either the Nd:YAG pump laser or the OPO.  Sufficient internal or external beam dumps will be provided for safe operation of the system.  Vendor will supply any interface computer card required for communication between the laser system’s electronic control unit and an IBM-compatible personal computer (GFE).  This computer will run a Windows 2000 compatible software package to control the function of, and collect output wavelength and other performance data from the laser system.  The system will include all power supplies, power cables, and control cables required for operation with any combination of the following electrical services:  208 VAC three phase, 30 amp, 60 Hz; 240 VAC single phase, 40 amp, 60 Hz; 110 VAC single phase, 20 amp, 60 Hz operation.  

Mechanical Dimensions:  Vendor will include a mechanical sketch of the entire system with correct external dimensions and relative component placements in their quotation.  The Nd:YAG laser, OPO, and beam steering optics must fit onto a 4 foot x 10 foot section of the optical table.  Free space within this 4x10 foot section will be reserved for the GFE relay imaging optical system, which is proposed to occupy a 6 inch wide by 12 inch tall corridor extending straight out along the Nd:YAG fundamental output port; functionally equivalent alternative placements of these relay imaging optics proposed by the Vendor will also be considered.  Due to extreme lab space limitations smaller power supplies (shorter than 30 inches) capable of fitting underneath the optical table are desirable.  

Anticipated Environmental Variations:  The laser system will be required to operate in a laboratory environment with poor temperature and humidity control.  Typical temperature variations during working hours can cover a 6 degree Celcius (°C) range, with occasional variations over a 10 °C range also possible.  Vendor will clearly state the temperature ranges over which the following System Performance and Warranty requirements will be met.  Vendor is invited to describe any special design or manufacturing considerations for their system which may mitigate against potential problems caused by the anticipated environmental variations.  

System Performance:  Vendor will provide “typical” test data from previously manufactured laser systems for all of the following technical requirements for the purpose of source selection.  Vendor will provide actual test data from the laser system built for AFRL/MNME for all of the following performance requirements as a deliverable.  The Nd:YAG laser will operate at 10 Hz and will provide at least 1.5 Joules per pulse at the 1064 nanometer (nm) fundamental for the secondary function; higher pulse energies are desirable.  Short-term 1064 nm pulse energy variations will not exceed ± 3 % for 99 % of the pulses over any 1 hour period.  Long-term (8 hour) average 1064 nm pulse energy drift will not exceed ± 3 %.  Duration of the 1064 nm pulse must fall within the 5 to 10 nanosecond (ns) range.  Timing jitter between the 1064 nm pulse and an externally accessible TTL trigger output signal must not exceed ± 1 ns.  The 1064 nm laser linewidth will not exceed 0.003 reciprocal-centimeters (cm-1).  The 1064 nm beam near field intensity spatial profile will approximate as closely as possible a “top hat” or “flat top” distribution (essential for the secondary application), with over 99 % of the beam energy contained within a 1 cm radius from the beam center.  The pointing stability of the 355 nm OPO pump beam will not exceed ± 30 micro-radians.  The OPO will provide tunable output covering the 450 nm to 1700 nm wavelength range; a small tuning gap near 710 nm is acceptable, but the absence of such a gap is preferred.  Vendor is invited to propose a wavelength extension option to provide for tunable output into the ultraviolet spectral region.  The OPO will provide pulse energies of at least:  50 milli-Joules (mJ) at 500 nm, 50 mJ at 600 nm, 30 mJ at 800 nm, 10 mJ at 1000 nm, and 5 mJ at 1600 nm.  Short-term OPO pulse energy variations will not exceed ± 10 % for 99 % of the pulses over any 1 hour period.  Long-term (8 hour) average OPO pulse energy drift will not exceed ± 10 %.  Duration of the OPO pulse must not exceed 10 ns.  Timing jitter between the OPO pulse and an externally accessible TTL trigger output signal must not exceed ± 2 ns.  The OPO linewidth must not exceed 0.08 cm-1 throughout the tuning range.  The diameter of the OPO beam (99 % beam energy) will not exceed 1 cm.  The divergence of the OPO beam will not exceed 2 milli-radians.  

Hardware/Software Manuals:  Vendor will include pricing for all technical manuals necessary to operate the proposed hardware and software.   

Serviceability and Warranty:  Vendor is invited to describe any special design or manufacturing considerations for their system which may reduce or eliminate the need for on-site service visits.  Vendor will clearly describe which parts are covered under the standard Warranty, the duration of the standard Warranty, and their estimated daily labor rate for an on-site service visit.  Vendor is invited to propose as an option an extended Warranty plan which will cover all parts, labor, and travel charges for a limited time period.
