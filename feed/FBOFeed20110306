<p>7.0 STATEMENT OF WORK:<br />7.1 Provide services of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) authorized Technical Representatives, experienced with the TAKE Main Diesel Generators installed onboard all TAKE Class vessels.<br />7.2 The OEM Technical Representatives shall test the generator windings insulation resistance in accordance with reference 2.1 and the following:<br />7.2.1 Measure the Polarization Index on each Main Diesel Engine Generator in accordance with reference 2.1.<br />7.2.2 Prior to measuring insulation resistance, remove all external connections to the generator and completely discharge the windings to the grounded machine frame.<br />7.2.3 Apply a constant 500 volts DC between the winding and the ground using a direct-indicating megohmeter, for 10 minutes. The PI is calculated ratio of the 10-minute to the 1-minute value of the insulation resistance, measured consecutively. Record resistance values after 1-minute and after 10-minutes. Calculations shall be as follows, Polarization Index (PI) = Resistance after 10 minutes/Resistance after 1 minute.<br />7.2.4 Tested values shall be compared against previous readings to track changes. If history is not available, the recommended minimum values of PI for all machine components insulation classes per IEC 60085-01:1984 are: Thermal Class Rating --- Minimum PI<br />Class A --- 1.5<br />Class B --- 2.0<br />Class F --- 2.0<br />Class H --- 2.0<br />7.2.5 Upon completion, provide condition report identifying all findings and deficiencies to the Chief Engineer and Port Engineer.<br />7.2.6 Notify the Chief Engineer to perform final inspection prior to reinstallation.<br />7.3 The OEM Technical Representatives shall clean and service the generator in accordance with reference 2.1 and the following;<br />Warning: Before starting any maintenance work, ensure that all electrical circuits to the generator are switched off, with isolators/circuit breakers locked in the open (off) position. Remove all fuses from auxiliary supplies. Ensure the rotor of the generator cannot turn. Dry insulation with high insulation resistance is capable of holding electrical charge for several hours. For reasons of safety, it is essential that the winding to be services on be adequately earthed for a stator winding of this size we would recommend an earthing period of approximately one hour. 3 Ensure all standard shipboard safety precautions have been followed to prevent injury to personnel or damage to machinery.<br />WARNING: Solvents should only be used in well-ventilated places and care should be taken with regard to naked flames. A warning label should be placed in a prominent position stating that the machine should not be energized until complete evaporation of the solvent and machine casing has been adequately ventilated. It is assumed that ship/site procedures exist regarding safety clothing etc. To be worn during the handling of solvents and these procedures shall be followed.<br />WARNING: During the draining/removal of the cooler, water spillage may occur. Care should be taken to prevent any spillages from entering the machine and windings. If this cannot be prevented, any leaked water must be dried prior to the windings being energized. If an excessive amount of water enters the windings, a pi check should be carried out (section 3.8) followed by a dry-out (section 6.9) if necessary. Any pools of water that have collected in the machine or in the area surrounding the machine should be completely dried. It is assumed that ship/site procedures exist regarding spillages and slipping hazards and these procedures should be followed.<br />Note 1: The coolers are five section coolers and have been designed for vertical withdrawal of the stacks without removing the complete cooler from the top of the generator.<br />7.3.1 Remove and Clean CACW cooler. Refer to reference 2.1 section 6.4.<br />7.3.2 Turn water supply off, drain cooler and disconnect.<br />7.3.3 Remove the fasteners around the stack endplate at the water connection end.<br />7.3.4 Remove the cover box at the return end.<br />7.3.5 Remove the bolts, nuts, and washers from the bottom flange and the top angle flange of the end duct.<br />7.3.6 Hoist end duct. The frame of the cooling stack has holes for lifting shackles. The stack should be lifted from the generator using these holes.<br />7.3.7 Set the stack up on blocks under the frame, not the dins, so that there is space all around it, and blow the fins out with clean dry compressed air at no more than 21 psi. If the dirt is oily, the fins may be sprayed with a warm detergent solution bit if this is done, dry the stack afterwards with air before it is replaced in the housing.<br />7.3.8 On the water side, remove both water box covers and rod the tubes through. Soft deposits can be removed with a brass brush but hard scale may need special treatment, see reference 2.1 for clarity.<br />7.3.9 Waterbox gaskets shall be examined for leaks. If a leak is found, remove the header box and fit with gasket as specified in reference 2.1.<br />7.3.10 Check for leaks in length of a tube between endplates.<br />7.3.11 Remove overall cover. See reference 2.1 section 6.4.<br />7.3.12 Clean all air ducts in the stator.<br />7.3.13 Clean the windings<br />Note 2: Do not allow solvents to soak into the windings as this may cause porosity of the insulation and allows the penetration of semi-conducting dirt detrimental to insulation resistance.<br />Note 3: The preferred method of turning the rotor is to use the barring equipment fitted to the diesel engine, which varies from one make to another.<br />7.3.14 Check the end windings and ensure that all supports and bindings are tight.<br />7.3.15 Check all connection for cleanliness and tightness. Look for signs of overheating.<br />7.3.16 Clean around the bearing pedestal. Examine the location around the insulation between the pedestal and the stool.<br />7.3.17 Check air gaps, air seals and oil seals. Faulty seals should be replaced as these will reduce the efficiency of the cooling and the machine may run hot.<br />7.3.18 Inspect the exciter and PMG windings and the rectifier assembly, cleaning as required.<br />7.3.19 Clean the cooler.<br />7.3.20 Replace overall cover and CACW cooler.<br />Note 4: When the cooler is reinstalled, release any trapped air using the vent plugs in the header box.<br />7.4 Perform operational test in accordance with reference 2.1.<br />8.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS: None additional.</p>
