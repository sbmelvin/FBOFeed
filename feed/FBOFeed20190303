<DESC>BACKGROUND
<p>The National Water Strategy 2016 - 2025 prepared by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI) states that Non Revenue Water (NRW) is one of the major issues that impact the water supply availability in Jordan. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI) placed NRW reduction as one of their highest priorities to sustain the water sector in the medium to long-term and maintain adequate resources to meet future demands. Reduction of NRW is also important at the utility level.  Reducing NRW will not only generate extra income to the water utilities, it will significantly reduce the operational costs to treat and pump the lost water. Reducing NRW means that water utilities will collect more revenue from the same amount of water treated and distributed, which will provide additional funds for reinvesting in the maintenance of local water networks and ensuring its sustainability: a "virtuous cycle". <br />USAID is supporting NRW reduction across the country to complement other projects such as supply expansion and network restructuring. USAID and GoJ have signed two Umbrella Fixed Amount Reimbursement  Agreements (FARAs) for NRW Project Phase I and II with total estimated cost of $212.1 million. The NRW Phase I started in January 1, 2015, and ends on September 30, 2019. The NRW Phase II Umbrella FARA started on August 5, 2018, and ends on December 30, 2023. The NRW Phase II includes more procurement of NRW-reduction equipment, restructuring and isolation of new District Metering Areas (DMAs), pressure management, replacement of old pipes, leak detection and repair, and installation/replacement of water meters, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems and other equipment, as necessary. <br />USAID/Jordan is considering a project to provide technical assistance to the NRW program, and improve water utilities' self-reliance by improving their capacities to plan, design, procure, and manage infrastructure upgrades so that future upgrades can be completed autonomously.</p>
