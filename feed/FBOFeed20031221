<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format are Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is NWWG9520049999 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC2001-18).  The contract will be a firm fixed price per day charge purchase order.  The per day charge will include all costs necessary to perform the contract.  Quoted estimates are to be itemized on a per day basis and shall identify the following:  estimated transit times from port to site and port-of-return, vessel rental fees (if applicable), vessel reconfiguration and restoration costs (if applicable), fuel/oil consumption, and food and accommodations for one NDBC and two SAIC contractor representatives, estimated transit times, boat rental fees (if applicable), and all other charges necessary to complete the trip.  This Statement of Work (SOW) provides information necessary to prepare quotes to deploy NDBC 6-meter buoy 6N37 at NOAA station 46076.  The contractor shall submit quotes on two options:  Option No. 1 is to load the vessel in Homer, AK Coast Guard Station, and return to Homer, AK to unload personnel and equipment.  Option No. 2 is to load at Homer, AK and return to a port chosen by the contractor with facilities to off load NDBC personnel and equipment.
The buoy shall be deployed at coordinates 56 Degrees 13 Minutes 34 seconds North, 155 Degrees 27 Minutes 27 Seconds West; approximately 25 nautical miles southwest of Tugidak Island, AK and 19.6 nautical miles north/northeast of Chirikof Island, AK.  The buoy is a boat shaped aluminum buoy, with dimensions of 20ft L x 8ft W x 8ft H, drawing a 5ft draft with a weight of 20,000 pounds.  The mooring consists of two sections.  The upper mooring section is a 6 ft nylon insulator at the top portion followed by a swivel.  The remainder of the mooring consists of 360 ft of 1-1/2 inch open link chain with a 6000-pound anchor.  
Deployment is scheduled to commence on or about January 18, 2004, and shall conclude with return to designated port.  Once at the deployment site, the ship shall deploy the buoy and mooring components.  The buoy can either be loaded on deck or towed by the mooring to the deployment site.  To tow by the mooring, a hawser will be connected to the first 90 ft of chain and the buoy shall be towed by the hawser.  After the buoy has been successfully deployed, the vessel is required to remain on station a minimum of three hours for system testing.
A minimum working deck area of 25 ft X 50 ft is required.  The deck must have sufficient pad-eyes or hold-downs on the deck to accommodate equipment for transit and to conduct operations.  The hold-downs or pad-eyes must be capable of supporting 6,000 pounds.  Winches and capstans are not required but are very helpful to serve as a cross deck.  The vessel must be capable of transporting a full mooring consisting of one 6,000-pound anchor and 500 ft of 1-1/2 inch open link chain (11,000 pounds) that must be faked out on the stern or side of the vessel.  On-board equipment must be provided for welding, acetylene cutting, and electrical power of 120/208 VAC.  Communications equipment to maintain contact with shore-based personnel must also be provided.  The vessel shall provide a crane operator and sufficient personnel to assist in handling of tag lines while on station which will be 6 to 8 hours.  The ship must have the capability to hold position within 25 meters and have DGPS for marking the position of the anchor.  The amount of notice needed to ship equipment is 5 days.  A rigid hull inflatable boat (minimum 5 meters) and operator is required to service the buoy during deployment.  The boat must be capable of operation in Beaufort Force 4 seas.  
The stern section of the vessel shall be free of bulwarks and obstructions to accommodate deployment of the mooring.  The edge of the deck that runs along the stern section must not have any sharp edges that might chaff the mooring line.
The vessel shall be capable of conducting deck operations in Beaufort Force Sea State 5.  Comfortable quarters and mess facilities for three NDBC and SAIC contractor personnel are required.
There are maximum sea states in which the vessel is expected to operate.  The decision whether to go or no-go when considering weather conditions shall be made by mutual agreement between the NDBC representative and the boat Captain, with the Captain having the final authority to postpone, cancel, or delay the mission.  Due consideration will be given to the safety of the vessel and personnel aboard at all times.  A no-go decision because of weather will not be considered a cancellation of the contract.
The Captain shall be licensed for offshore transportation to the location specified.  The vessel must meet all United States Coast Guard requirements.  Vessel Specifications sheets shall be provided with the quote.  The contracted vessel will load the NDBC gear, personnel, and buoy at the U.S. Coast Guard Base Homer, AK and preferably return to the same location.
NDBC reserves the right to conduct a survey of the vessel prior to awarding the contract.  The contractor must carry adequate liability insurance to cover personnel, equipment and any damage/loss that might result from operations during the course of the trip.  Complete replacement cost for a 6-meter buoy is approximately $245,000.00.
OSHA compliant safety practices shall be followed at all times.
Description of vessel, equipment and specifications must be provided with quote.  The following FAR provisions apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration, FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; FAR 212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders.
