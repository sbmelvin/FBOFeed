<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate with JD Power and Associates/Power Information Network on a Sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) only one responsible source.

The acquisition is to establish a purchase order for a base period of 12 months and one additional 12 month option period, for detailed estimates of imputed services of multipurpose motor vehicles (MVs) for calendar year 1997. Capital services flow (CSF) methodology will be used to estimate the value of MV services. Services from the stock of MVs in operation will be imputed using a market-equivalent measure. This measure assumes that the value of MV leases is a good proxy for the market value of MV services. Like the rental equivalent for owner-occupied housing, MVs will be grouped, or “clustered” into categories by models. For cars, these are: Subcompact; compact; intermediate; standard; and luxury. For trucks, these are: Class 1-2; Class 3-5; SUV’s and vans. Four types of “motor-vehicle rental equivalent” (MVRE) will be computed, one each for personal cars, personal (light) trucks; business car fleets, and business (light) truck fleets. The vendor will provide the following detailed data series for utilization by autos, and small trucks at the “model” Level; Separate data for: Leased motor vehicles, personal, business, business fleets; Purchased motor vehicles: personal, business, business fleets. Frequency: Monthly transactions in all cases and monthly internal rate of return (IRR). Model Year; Leased and purchased motor-vehicle transactions are needed for current model year and the previous model year, e.g.: 1997 model purchased in 1997, 1996 model purchased in 1997, 1996 model purchased in 1996, 1995 model purchased in 1996, 1995 model purchased in 1995, 1994 model purchased in 1995, 1994 model purchased in 1994, 1993 model purchased in 1994, 1993 model purchased in 1993, and 1992 model purchased in 1993. Leased motor-vehicles data: “actual” leasing data at the national level, in addition to 1997, data for earlier years and given that PIN started collecting “actual” leasing data in California in 1993 and expanded to national level, California data and the national data for an overlapping year (for example 1998). Need the information on how the PIN sample gets augmented from the California level to the national level. Metrics: Detailed components to compute IRR, which are composed of the following: Net Capital Cost, Base Monthly payment, Term, Security Deposit, Acquisition Fee, Residual Cost, and if there are other elements, there needed also. Purchased motor-vehicle data: Vehicle cost, Vehicle Price, Vehicle price less customer cash rebate, and Transaction count. The collection of this data should be based on sound data sampling techniques and methodologies. 

Power Information Network is uniquely qualified to provide the dataset, outlined in the requirement. Power Information Network conducts data retrieval not available to BEA for imputed services of multipurpose motor vehicles from each states Motor Vehicles Administration’s (MVA) registration data for motor vehicles in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. This data is obtained from state MVA offices and manufactures as required by BEA.

Offerors certain they can meet the requirements are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is soley within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis. (Note 22 applies with a 15-day posting)

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

HSAR 3052.209–70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE 
                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b) (1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of Electronic Protective Measures Modem System (EMS). The competitive bidding is limited to companies engaged in delivering similar capabilities to their National authorities. NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the Infrastructure Committee. The total value is estimated at 10 million Euros ($12 million USD).

The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) is IFB-CO-11789-EMS. The NATO project number is 2001/5CM03013-0. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

1. NATO has identified the need for a Super High Frequency (SHF) Anti-Jam (AJ) Satellite Communications Network Modem capability within NATO IV and NATO V Satellite Communications System. That capability is to be provided by the Electronic Protective Measures (EPM) Modems System (EMS).   

2. EMS shall support at SHF the communication and associated control capabilities under jamming conditions for deployed CJTF operations at Medium Data Rates (MDR) [64 kbps, 2Mbps]. 

3. EMS shall comply with Ratification draft of STANAG 4606 edition 1, dated 25 August 2004.  

4. EMS equipment shall meet the environmental conditions that apply for operations involving land or maritime deployments. The TRANSEC function and the control messages exchanged between control entities over the air (i.e. between the Network controller and controlled terminals) shall be secured in accordance with NATO security policy.

5. EMS shall operate within the coverage area involving a group of land and/or maritime users deployed under one or more beams supporting three concurrent Major Joint Operations (MJO) or more than three concurrent Operations smaller than an MJO.

6. EMS shall support operations where users are all in the same coverage; such as Land, Maritime, NATO.

7. EMS shall support operations where users are spread under coverages which do not overlap and are cross strapped on board of the satellite, i.e. between:

(a) Land coverage and NATO coverage (including when Land coverage and NATO coverage do not overlap);

(b) Maritime coverage and NATO coverage (including when Maritime coverage and NATO coverage do not overlap).

8. EMS shall support point to point and network mode of operations as defined in STANAG 4606, Edition 1. Specific maritime mode of operations such as:  

(a) Listen only; 

(b) Electronic Supportive Measures as per STANAG 4606, Edition 1; and 

(c) Operation in presence of worst-case maritime platform dynamic with a minimal degradation in performance.

EMS Main Components:

1. Channel Units (CU): Cus can be configured either as Communications Units or Control Units, and are installed into rack mounted assemblies.

2. Local Management Equipment (LME): LME is able to manage a given number of rack-mounted assemblies. Not that an LME could possibly be physically integrated in a rack-mounted assembly.

3. A fit (for a SGS/SGT, a TSGT or any other NATO installation) is defined as the association of a LME and CUs, integrated in one or several rack mount assemblies, according to the quantities.

4. EMS Planning Computers (EPC): EPCs are required to support mission planning services at the SATCOM Active Control Center (SACC) premises. A second EPC at the SATCOM Backup Control Center (SBCC) premises serves as a backup. Note that the EPC requirements describe the functions that are required to plan and configure an EMS network. The EPC requirements may be implemented as multiple distinct functional processing entities, and utilize multiple LRUs (Lowest Replaceable Units) as appropriate.

EMS Deliverables:

The scope of work encompasses the delivery of equipment within 3 Contract SLICES, the first one being firm, the others optional. An additional 4th SLICE is to be potentially used as a baseline between the selected bidder and any NATO Nation.

1. Execute the systems engineering, project management, quality assurance and configuration management requirements of the Contract.

2. Adapt an existing Electronic Protective Measures (EPM) system design to the requirements of the technical specifications of this contract.

3. Put such a design into production.

4. Deliver EMS capabilities in accordance with the Contract Schedule and ensure that preparation activities are completed in accordance with the installation requirements of the delivered EMS system.  This in general involves test and evaluation of all the subassemblies, assemblies, components and parts, system integration and in particular, involves:

(a) Ensuring that the delivered EMS capabilities are and approved by the National Cryptographic Security Agency of the selected contractor and validated by SECAN.

(b) Assisting the Purchaser in installing EMS capabilities in two NATO Transportable SATCOM Ground Terminals (TSGT).

<DESC>This replaces the previously posted synopsis, N0002405R4143, dated 10 February 2005.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has a requirement to inspect, disassemble, repair, overhaul, modify, replace and test AN/STC-2(V) and Marcom Integrated Voice Communications Systems (IVCS) Equipment and Components for AEGIS Class ships.  A Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with L3 Communications, 1 Federal Street, Camden, NJ 08102 for a period of 36 months will be issued.  L3 Communications is the sole producer of the AN/STC-2(V) IVCS and is currently providing the MarCom IVCS systems for AEGIS Class ships.  The government does not have a technical data package which would permit competitive acquisition of IVCS hardware or repair services, and the Statement of Work cannot be modified to allow other sources.  See numbered note 22. Note 22— The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit LCR Electronics, Inc., 9 S. Forrest Avenue, Norristown, PA 19401-5217 on a sole-source basis for two (2) each JWICS Filter Cabinets, part number F18836-4W Rev. 1.  LCR Electronics hardware is a core component of the DJC2 power system.  It is used to provide secure EMI-filtered power to the “high side” of the DJC2 communications system during periods where shore power is available.  It currently fits within a specific location in the established load plan, and is a fielded part of the system.  While there are other hardware components that would fulfill the form, fit, and functionality of these items, a monumental amount of time and money for training, redevelopment and delivery of interactive electronic training aids, redesign of systems engineering, retesting, reintegration, approval by Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), replacement of existing systems for c!  onfiguration control, and rewriting and re-approval of IATO documentation would result.  Current estimates of this impact for one DJC2 program hardware item was estimated at approximately 16 months and $1.3M.  Equipment will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 334414 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees.  FSC is 5915.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) has requested the assistance of the Nations in identifying firms within their national industrial base that may be interested in participating in the System Engineering & Integration (SE&I) effort supporting the Active Layer Theatre Ballistic Missile Defense (ALTBMD) Program and receive comments on an outline of the Statement of Work (SOW) for the ALTBMD System Engineering and Integration Support Contract.

It is stressed that this letter is NOT a Notification of Intent to Call for Bids.

In 1998, NATO agreed to a program plan for an ALTBMD capability. This first phase of the program was fulfilled in May 2004 with the completion of a Feasibility Study and approval of a NATO Staff Requirement (NSR). The NSR recommended enhancement of the three major capabilities: The Air Command & Control System (ACCS), the Bi-SC Automated Information System (Bi-SC AIS) and the NATO General purpose Communication System (NGCS).

NATO has developed a concept for a Program Management Organization (PMO) that will oversee the enhancement of the three capabilities. An independent PMO has been established, which includes a Program Office (PO) hosted by NC3A. The PO is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the ALTBMD Program. It will be responsible for the correct implementation of the ALTBMD tasks.

In support of the PO role in coordination and oversight of the implementation of the enhancements, a contractor will be engaged for System Engineering and Integration (SE&I) efforts. The attached document describes a top-level outline for a SE&I SOW. The outline provides a high level description of tasks and activities envisaged to be executed by the SE&I contractor. The outline has been developed as a first step in the development of a preliminary SOW for the Invitation for Bid (IFB) for acquisition of the SE&I services.

Please note that NC3A will soon issue a solicitation to provide contractor management support to the ALTBMD PO. The selected contractor for this support contract may be excluded from participating in the SE&I.

The Market Survey solicits industry comments to the attached SOW outline. These comments may address the overall scope of the effort and/or particular aspects described in the outline. In addition, industry views on whether the scope of the effort is excessive in some areas or omits important aspects in other areas are welcome. The comments of industry are requested in order to improve the overall quality of the development of the SOW for the Invitation for Bid. Please be assured that NC3A will treat your comments on a confidential basis and that they will not be shared with other industries.

NC3A is constrained by NATO procedures to award contracts only on a fixed price basis. Industry is invited to comment on the application of fixed price contract(s) to this effort. Industry is further welcome to provide their views as to whether implementation strategies such as Incremental or Spiral Development are applicable to the SE&I project and, if so, provide a description of how such increments or spirals could be constructed.

As a secondary objective, the Market Survey is intended to gauge the interest of NATO countries industries in participating in the IFB for the SE&I contract and their capabilities to provide some or all of the required services. NC3A would like to determine the number of firms interested in undertaking the role of prime contractor and the potential pool of industry available in subcontracting roles. Companies that respond to the Market Survey are asked to describe their specific strengths in areas described in the Attachment, which are important for the execution of the SE&I contract.

It is anticipated that the formal Invitation for Bid will be issued in the 1st Quarter of 2006.

ELIGIBILITY

A Declaration of Eligibility is NOT REQUIRED for this Market Survey. However, a Declaration of Eligibility will be required for those firms interesting in bidding on the forthcoming Invitation for Bids (IFB) once its Notification of Intent (NOI) is issued later this year. Therefore, firms whose facility is located within the United States are encouraged to go ahead and seek certification with the U.S. Department of Commerce in order to qualify to bid on this and future IFB opportunities.

Please visit the following website for more information regarding receiving certification and the required Declaration of Eligibility for future IFBs:

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A  PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.   The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) intends to negotiate and award  a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Dr. Jie Wen, 101 Rockville Pike #107 Rockville, Maryland 20852, to continue to provide the Laboratory of Oral Infection and Immunity with professional laboratory support services to explore the molecular basis and mechanisms responsible for antineoplastic effects of the innate immunoregulatory molecule, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor.  The knowledge obtained will help the development of rational targeted therapies for the prevention and treatment of cancer.  Specifically, the tasks to be performed by Dr. Wen, are to work on the use of cDNa arrays and proteomics by identifying molecules that are for the fibrinolytic, metastatic and immune modulatory effects of SLPI, to complete cell culture, cell transfection for protein expression, RNA extraction, large scale isolation of cellular protein, assays of apoptosis, and DNA manipulation.  Dr. Wen, will also utilize mRNA to assess the genomic-wide expression of genes relevant for the tumorigenic effects of these molecules. Validate the results using real-time PCR analysis, determine the effects of these molecules on the proteomic profile of cells exposed to these agents their associated molecules from cells, and keeping careful records of all experiments that will be performed.  The performance of the contract will be evaluated daily and if it the performance is considered to be substandard in the judgment of the Project Officer,  it shall be documented, and corrective measures of improvement shall be accomplished as well.  Period of performance is a minimum of 40 hours per week Monday thru Fridays performing studies, starting November 1, 2005 thru April 30, 2006.  Failure to arrive on time or to follow the time schedules or instructions as indicated shall be considered default of the contract. The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills and expertise that Dr. Wen, possess and continues to provide  support in protocol #3243.  She is an expert in molecular biology and has extensive experience in the evaluation of proteases and signal transducing pathways in cells necessary for theses experiments.  An     award to any other source would affect the NIH’s anticipated outcome based upon Dr. Wen, experience, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.   The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest  and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number “NHLBI-PS-(DE)-2005-002-DDC,” may be submitted to the  National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20814-7902,  Attention: Deborah Coulter.

The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipt of $18.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under the North American Industry Classification System.  Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by small businesses, small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantage individuals. The NRC intends to issue a Commercial Item, Firm-Fixed Price contract for a one (1) year period of performance with three (3) one-year option periods.  NOTE: THE ATTACHMENTS (Statement of Work and Minimum Specifications for Vehicles) ARE ATTACHED.  Offeror shall submit firm-fixed prices for each period of performance inclusive of the option years. OBJECTIVE:   The contractor shall lease to NRC up to three (3) new, full-size, six passenger (Class IV) sedans and one (1) sport utility vehicle, (hereafter referred to as vehicles) on an annual basis for an estimated of four years (an initial base year with three additional one-year optional periods). REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall lease to the Government, up to four (4) vehicles at a firm fixed price.   All vehicles provided by the Contractor during the period of performance of this contract, or any extension, shall have the minimum specifications listed in the attachments. There are three option periods under this contract as follows: (1)  The Government shall have the option to lease up to four vehicles, for a first one-year period, at the firm fixed unit prices set forth of this contract. Should the Government elect to exercise it’s option for the first year lease, the Government shall also have the option to retain the same vehicles received for the base year of the contract. (2) The Government shall have the option to lease up to four  vehicles, for a second one-year period, at the firm fixed unit prices set forth of this contract.   Should the Government elect to exercise it’s option for the third year lease, the Government shall also have the option to retain the same vehicles received for the previous year of the contract.  (3) The Government shall have the option to lease up to four vehicles, for a third one-year period, at the firm fixed unit prices set forth of this contract. Should the Government elect to exercise it’s option for the third year lease, the Government shall also have the option to retain the same vehicles received for the previous year of the contract. (4) The Government shall have the option to exchange to another type of vehicle with at least 30-days notification to the Contractor.  The Contractor shall have the vehicles available for pickup by the NRC at the Contractor’s facility in any location within the Metropolitan Washington, DC area.  The vehicles shall be available for the Government’s pickup on the delivery schedule date as set forth in Clause No. 52.212-2 under this contract, which at such time, the term of the initial base year (1st-year) lease shall begin. The vehicles will be garaged at NRC’s headquarters, located at the One White Flint North Building, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland.  NRC is exempt under 41 CFR 101-38.204, from the requirement to display official U.S. Government license tags and other identification.  The Contractor shall therefore furnish all required tags from the State Of Maryland for the vehicles prior to the Government’s pickup of the vehicles. The Government will install telephones and reading lamps in each of the leased vehicles and will remove this equipment from the vehicles upon expiration of the contract.   WARRANTY: The manufacturer’s standard warranty for the leased vehicles shall cover the entire period under this contract or any extension.  Any towing that may be required for warranty service shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor. MAINTENANCE: The Contractor shall perform all routine maintenance on the leased vehicles in accordance with the maintenance schedule recommended by the manufacturer (i.e. oil and oil filter changes, lubrication, tire rotation, fluid replenishment, etc.).  RETURN OF VEHICLES:  At least 30-days prior to the expiration or termination of this contract, the Government will contact the Contractor to determine a destination within the Washington Metropolitan area mutually agreeable to both parties for the return of the vehicles.  The Government will return the vehicles to the Contractor at the mutually agreed delivery destination, not later than five work days after expiration or termination of the contract period for the vehicles.  The Contractor shall be responsible for performing an appraisal of the physical condition of each vehicle returned by the Government, prior to that vehicle being released from the Government’s custody, and shall furnish the Government with a copy of the appraisal upon it’s completion.  The Government shall not be responsible for any damage not listed on the appraisal report. The Government will assume full responsibility for reconditioning the vehicles at it’s expense, excluding normal wear and tear as defined below .  For purposes of this contract lease, “normal wear and tear” is defined as those dents, dings, paint chips, scratches, pitted but not cracked windshields, and interior wear such as soiled carpets and seats, normally occurring to a motor vehicle over the contract period of use, in both a rural and metropolitan area.  In any event, the Government’s liability for any reconditioning of the vehicles shall be limited to replacement of glass and exterior trim, and repair to body damage attributable to collision only, and to interior damage such as cut, torn, burnt materials, as well as mechanical repair.  Contractors are cautioned that the Government, by signing the damage estimate, does not acknowledge liability therefore.  This can only be accomplished by an authorized NRC Contracting Officer after evaluation and consideration of all factors.  SUPPLIES OR SERVICES: The Government estimates that each vehicle will be driven approximately 5,000 miles per year and does not anticipate use of the vehicle in excess of this mileage.   State the expected lead time of the vehicles in your proposals.   It is estimated the initial one-year for the vehicles would begin on November 10, 2005. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this Request of Quotation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the Request for Quotation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Past Performance; (2) Technical specifications; and (3) Price.  Technical and past performance, when combined are more important than price. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  PAST PERFORMANCE: The Offeror shall demonstrate successful past performance in performing work that is similar in size and scope to this procurement.  The Offeror shall submit all contracts performed during the past five years similar size and scope to this procurement. This shall be done by describing current and past work of a similar or identical nature in such a manner that an evaluation can be made of the performance history and the relevance of this experience to the requirements of the solicitation.  It is incumbent upon the Offeror to provide information which is accurate and current as the NRC will attempt to contact some of the references to verify the information provided.  The Offeror shall provide the information requested using the format specified below.  Each contract reference shall be limited to one page in length: 
(a) Contract or Purchase Order Number; (b) Name and Address of Government Agency; ©) Point of Contact;(d)Contracting Officer; 
(e)Current Telephone Number and Facsimile Number;(f)Technical Representatives; (g) Estimated value of Purchase Order/Contract Award;(h) Period of Performance of the Contract or Purchase Order (including extensions);(i)Outline how the contracted effort is similar or identical in nature to the NRC’s requirement, with a brief technical description sufficient to permit ready assessment of the described project’s relevancy to the NRC’s requirement.  It is not sufficient to just note that it is similar in magnitude, size and scope.  The NRC may, but is not required, to contact some of the references provided and inquire as to the offeror’s performance.  The NRC may also consult other sources of performance and customer satisfaction on current and past contracts.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of advanced radar technology that will overcome deficiencies in existing and planned radar systems to detect, track, and identify aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, space debris, ground vehicles, and subsurface complexes in clutter and countermeasure environments.  The survivability of new and existing systems must also be improved without the use of decoys.  Upgrades to existing ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) Platforms and demonstrations to support transition to the next level of technology development, and evolutions to new sensors and concepts (Unmanned Air Vehicles, Space Based Platforms, etc.) need to be addressed.  Sensor concepts should include multiple configurations with characteristics supporting diverse multimission requirements including Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Multiband SAR/Tomographic Imaging features, and Foliage Penetrating (FOPEN) Radar.  These concepts include both Monostatic and Multistatic solutions.  Lookdown Bistatic concepts should include bistatic receivers using radiators of opportunity (TV, FM etc.) with large wideband receive antennas.  Areas of interest include new and innovative advances in system architectures, hardware, software and/or signal processing algorithm improvements, diverse transmit waveforms, survivability, positional estimation improvements, unique concepts in radar system design, Multi-Basing Look Down Surveillance (Air and Space), Augmentation of Reconnaissance Capabilities (development of new surveillance capabilities in Reconnaissance sensors), Ground Penetrating Radar, Bistatic/Multistatic Radar (Non-cooperative emitter stand alone sensors and Cooperative augmentation of existing ISR Platforms through UAVs), the architecture and signal processing for expendable UAV radar probes and theater missile defense.  Additional technology areas include the measurement, test, analysis and modeling efforts that are required to support the development of advanced radar systems. The primary emphasis is to identify and demonstrate promising technologies for both monostatic and multistatic radar sensors in the areas of Space Time Adaptive Processing, both Adaptive and Knowledge Based (KB), Multi-Channel Signal Processing Techniques, Innovative and Wideband Processing Techniques, Multi-Dimensional Processing Techniques, Improved radar system performance developments in spread doppler clutter environment for a theater application and, in general, technologies that may significantly improve the performance of advanced radar systems.  In some cases, AFRL Rome may be able to provide further information.  Contact the technical POC.  The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.

Passive Sensing:  AFRL Rome Research Site is also soliciting white papers for efforts to develop technology to support a passive sensing capability for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and strike functions providing Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI), Synthetic Array Radar (SAR), Interferometric SAR (IFSAR), Electronic Support (ES) and Electro Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) with no gaps in temporal/spatial/spectral coverage.  The effort will occur over a 36 month period, with a projected expenditure of $3.2 M.  The objective of this effort is to provide a comprehensive and quiet sensor capable of sensing and exploiting the entire RF spectrum.  This sensor is envisioned to meld the surveillance capabilities of a passive radar (commonly known as bistatics) with the capabilities of an advanced ESM suite resulting in an advanced sensor that shares, as much as possible, a common architecture, aperture and information.  We wish to develop a sensor with the following operational capabilities:  Shared resource management; common antenna and receiver; ISR Surveillance capability; ES; ES Cueing of radar; adaptive control; improved resistance to jamming; sources provide ESM Identification plus LPI radar illumination; greater ESM sensitivity; and scanning phased array for radar.  For the sensor development, it will be necessary to perform system functional analysis of both passive radar and ESM systems to determine common functions that can be combined into a single unit, determine receiver key performance metrics and conduct trade-off studies to determine architecture performance.
The recommended date for the submission of white papers for this topic area (passive sensing) is 14 Nov 2005.  The technical point of contact for this topic area is Paul Gilgallon, AFRL/SNRD, 315-330-4409.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Radar Operation Center (ROC) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Telelogic North America, Inc., 11911 Freedom Drive, Suite 1180, Reston, VA 20190 for annual maintenance renewal of Telelogic DOORS® (Dynamic Object Orientated Requirements Software), the software tool used by the open systems and engineering team. The maintenance is required to provide the latest version in the development of the open systems for the WSR-88D radar.  Telelogic DOORS® software is used by the ROC to provide requirements management/traceability and maintain key interface control documents. Telelogic DOORS® software also serves as the key document change management control facility for the Radar Products Generator (RPG), Open Principle User Processor, (OPUP) and the Radar Data Acquisition (ORDA) documentation. The ROC depends on Telelogic DOORS® for testing support as well, because it provides a means to tie test steps to specific requirements which is vital to successful verification of system performance. Without Telelogic DOORS®, the ROC would be unable to effectively manage and control critical baseline documentation used to support the NEXRAD computer systems. In addition, the ROC would lose the significant Telelogic DOORS® investment the ROC, National Severe Storms Lab (NSSL) and the RS Information Systems (RSIS) ORDA team have already made in this application. Telelogic North America, formerly QSS Inc., is the manufacturer of the software and the only vendor who provides the maintenance.

<DESC>NOTES TO ALL POTENTIAL RESPONDERS: This RFI is a follow-up to RFI W15P7T-05-R-S521 published on the FEDBIZOPS website, and has been modified to reflect changes based on industry response. In addition, the Government has identified new parameters for which we are seeking additional information. 1.	PURPOSE: The Government is soliciting responses from industry as to their specific capabilities in the area of manufacturing, systems integration, system test and derivative production activities. This effort is in support of urgent operational and warf ighter needs in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and countering the RCIED.  2.	BACKGROUND: The system is currently in production and is under contract to the Government for that effort.  At the current time, the Government is investigating alternative means of meeting increased system production to satisfy higher rate production  quantities, and expedited delivery to the OIF/OEF operational theaters.  New requirements have been identified for the program: increased quantities, high rate production and delivery, and shortened timelines to delivery. 3.	SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The System is a wideband ECM device comprised of a Receiver/Transmitter (R/T) subsystem consisting of a chassis with five circuit card assemblies (CCA), power amplifiers, power conditioning. The system design is current, state-of-t he-art design with surface mount, multi-layer CCAs, with embedded firmware/FPGA controlling system operation in two modes: as an active transmitter and in a reactive mode. There is an associated Remote Control Unit (RCU) for remote operation via direct cab le interface to the R/T unit.

<SUBJECT>89 -- Notice of Our Valued Suppliers
<DESC>MEMORANDUM FOR DSCP SUBSISTENCE PRODUCE VENDORS

To Our Valued Business Partners:  

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued support of our war fighters.  During these times, it is important that the level of support remain high, while remaining aware of the ever-changing world events which can cause disruption to customer support.  We here at the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), as well as our customers and their respective Headquarters personnel, appreciate all you have done, and will continue to do, to support our war fighters.

The DSCP is a leader in providing its customers with cost savings, and quality product, and is always striving to continue to improve its way of doing business.  To continue to improve DSCP’s service to its customers, the Produce Acquisition Branch is initiating a new business initiative.  In lieu of issuing weekly buys to support troop, DeCA Commissaries or School Lunch Programs, DSCP will be entering into long term Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQC’s).  An IQC contract will be awarded to a full line produce provider to delivery an entire catalog of items to one or more customers exclusively.  The IQC contract will greatly reduce the amount of paperwork that is handled by DSCP and its customers.  The new business practice will also reduce cost for the customer.  There are some areas within the DSCP Produce network that already operate under this new business practice, others are just beginning.  DSCP Produce plans to have customers throughout the continental United States under long-term contracts within the next 12-18 months.  

In addition to supporting the customer through the use of IQC contracts, DSCP Produce intends to utilize an electronic ordering system.  In an effort to streamline our ordering and receipt process, future contracts will require vendors to be able to accept, acknowledge and receipt orders through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).  Therefore, to continue to provide produce to our customers, vendors must be EDI compliant within the next 18 months.  

The system currently used by DSCP Customers is Subsistence Total Ordering and Receipt Electronic System (STORES).  STORES will electronically submit a customer’s order directly to the contracted vendor.  It also automatically sets up the invoice process that is completed when the customer acknowledges receipt at time of delivery.

The EDI Guidelines for Implementation to can be found at the DIBBS website (https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/) under Notices (at bottom of page).  This document outlines the points of contact and EDI transaction sets that you as a vendor will be responsible for implementing.  Although a timeframe has yet to be developed for full implementation, the sooner your company is EDI capable the better equipped it will be to assist in providing the customers with improved services.  

If your company is able to exchange information electronically through ANSI X12 format, we could set your company up as an EDI vendor immediately, being able to receive orders and send invoices electronically.  The transaction set for an order is an 850, while the transaction set for an Invoice is an 810.  It is highly recommend that you utilize these transactions sets in unison to provide a seamless order and payment process.  While this is a business decision for your firm, there are companies available for a fee that will turn your flat files into EDI Invoices (810 transactions).

To reiterate, all produce vendors must be EDI compliant within the next 18 months to continue providing product to our customers.  If you have any questions, concerns or need assistance, please contact Frank Holder, frank.holder@dla.mil, 215-737-3311; Joanne Bonese, Joanne.bonese@dla.mil, 215-737-2913 or Dawn Leason, dawn.leason@dla.mil, 215-737-4364.

<SUBJECT>A -- U.S. Joint Forces Command has new Technology Transfer Authorities
<DESC>USJFCOM (Norfolk VA) has new technology transfer authorities:  In March 2005, the Office of the Secretary of Defense delegated Technology Transfer Authority (TTA) to U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) similar to those of national labs.  This TTA will allow USJFCOM to partner with the private sector and provide the means for the exchange of personnel and technical data, the assessment of technology, and collaboration on research and development efforts.  This will accelerate the development of new ideas into integrated capabilities for the joint warfighter.  USJFCOM Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA):  To coordinate its technology transfer activities, USJFCOM stood up the Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA).  That office coordinates engagement with the private sector, offers advice on technology transfer, and assists with the technology transfer mechanisms like Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), intellectual property agreements, patent licensing agreements, and personnel exchanges.  The ORTA helps to identify new technologies that will help fulfill warfighter requirements.
Engaging with the private sector:  The private sector is encouraged to engage directly with personnel and directorates within USJFCOM if those parties are known.  In cases where private industry or academia does not know the appropriate parties within USJFCOM, contact should be made by sending an email to the ORTA at tech.transfer@jfcom.mil explaining the nature of the desired engagement.  If the objective of the engagement is to demonstrate a capability or to provide a capabilities presentation or to initiate a CRADA, the email should include a submission appropriate to allow USJFCOM to determine interest in the engagement.  Submission types include:
Executive summaries; White papers; Technical papers; RFI; responses; Capability briefs; Unsolicited proposals; Requests to demonstrate capabilities; Requests to provide capability briefs; 
Other (telephone contacts, personal contacts).  USJFCOM will review and distribute the submission to appropriate subject matter experts in the various directorates, labs and subordinate commands.  Even in cases where contact is made directly to a specific party, it is requested that a copy be submitted to tech.transfer@jfcom.mil.  This will allow the ORTA to ensure that all organizations within USJFCOM are aware of your submission.     How JFCOM will handle submissions:  Emails sent to tech.transfer@jfcom.mil are reviewed daily by the Engagement Review Team, comprised of representatives from the ORTA, Science Advisor, J5 Industry Engagement, Business Office/Contracts, Public Affairs Office, and Legal Office.  The review team will:  Acknowledge receipt of the submission and log it for review; Ensure that industry submissions and requests are appropriately distributed and staffed; Provide industry with status and response feedback related to their submissions; Maintain an engagement tracking system; Identify promising CRADA opportunities.  Legal/Contractual Issues:  Since the Engagement Review Team includes representatives from the legal and the business manager codes, we can immediately ensure that proper information is available on FAR-related matters.  For example, if a submission is received that is clearly in the general area of an ongoing procurement action by USJFCOM, we can flag that and notify the submitting organization that we cannot address that submission until the procurement action has concluded.  Scope of technology transfer at JFCOM:  Technology transfer takes on two primary forms at USJFCOM.  The traditional form of technology transfer is to ‘spin off’ technologies developed at a government lab to the private sector.  In the case of USJFCOM, the more common form of technology transfer will be to ‘spin on’ technologies from the private sector to USJFCOM.  Our technology transfer authorities provide mechanisms to partner with the private sector for both ‘spin on’ and ‘spin off.’  The primary mechanism is the CRADA.  What is a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)?  A Cooperative Research and Development Agreement is a legal agreement between a government laboratory and one or more non-government parties such as private industry, academia, or non-profit organizations. CRADAs offer both parties an opportunity to collaborate, to leverage each other’s resources and to share risks in conducting mutually beneficial R&D. The government partner may provide personnel, facilities, and equipment to perform the cooperative research, but may not provide funds to support the CRADA. The other party may provide personnel, facilities, equipment, and funding. 
A CRADA: Identifies the R&D objectives; Defines the individual responsibilities of each party toward achieving stated objectives; Defines the resources that each party will provide; Establishes the intellectual property rights of both parties to the products developed under the CRADA.  CRADAs can incorporate a variety of arrangements to protect intellectual property, but in all cases the government retains a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to inventions developed under the CRADA.  CRADAs can have durations ranging from a few months to multiple years.  Summary:  The receipt of Technology Transfer Authorities, the establishment of the ORTA and the pursuit of CRADAs are key elements of USJFCOM’s ongoing effort to improve engagement with the private sector and to speed the delivery of improved capabilities to the warfighter.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --
(1) The solicitation number;
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;
(5) Terms of any express warranty;
(6) Price and any discount terms;
(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address;
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(j) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.
