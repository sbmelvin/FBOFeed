INTRODUCTION: This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract that is being procured in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers Statute (Public Law 92-582), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.6, VA Acquisition Regulation 836.6 and Public Law 109-461.  Pursuant to 38 USC 8127(d), competition is restricted to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms, as there is a reasonable expectation that two or more offers from SDVOSB firms will be received as a result of this notice. 

This announcement is NOT a request for proposal. NO solicitation package will be issued until after an evaluation has been made on the submitted SF 330s. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. Any requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. No material will be issued and no solicitation package or bidder/plan holder list will be issued.

B. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Network Contracting Office (NCO) 23, is seeking to acquire AE Design, Construction, Historic Preservation and other Design Services that follow all local, federal and state regulations and guidelines.  These services are essential for the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide high quality and cost effective facilities in support of our nation's Veterans. The Omaha Construction Team s key customers are, but not limited to the Omaha, Grand Island, Lincoln, Fort Meade, Hot Springs, and Sioux Falls Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and their VA Community Clinics (formerly known as Community Based Outpatient Clinics) which proudly work at the front lines of service delivery.

The VA anticipates awarding up to five (5) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside IDIQ AE contracts for work within North Dakota and Iowa.  Fixed-Price (FFP) contracts will be negotiated and awarded for a base period of one (1) year plus four one (1) year option periods.  The amount of the contract awarded to each SDVOSB firm will have a total contract capacity of $10,000,000.00 over the life of the contract. The minimum guarantee amount shall be $1,000.00 for this contract.  The contract is anticipated to be awarded in 2018 and completed in 2023.

AE services will be acquired by the issuance of Task Orders against this contract for work within the boundaries of the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 23. (See the attached Map for VA locations within Nebraska and South Dakota). In accordance with FAR 52.216-19 - Order Limitations, the minimum order shall not be below $1,000.00 and the maximum single order shall not be greater than $2,000,000.00.  If remaining capacity falls below $1,000.00, the Government will consider the contract complete. 

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICs) codes for this acquisition are Architect or Architect/Engineer firms with an approved NAICS Code of 541310   Architectural Services, with a small business size standard of $7,500,000.00 in average annual receipts and 541330   Engineering Services, with a small business size standard of $15,000,000.00 in average annual receipts. 

To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. Representations and Certifications must be completed electronically via this site.  Register via the SAM Internet site at www.sam.gov or by contacting the SAM Customer Service at 
1-866-606-8220.  

Firms must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status and ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status. Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz.gov at the time SF 330s are submitted, when the proposal is received as a result of the solicitation issued to the most qualified firm, and on the date of contract award will result in the offeror s proposal and SF 330 being deemed not acceptable. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.

Quality Control Plans will be required at the time of award. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under the resulting contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Labor Standards, as determined relative to the employee's office location (not the location of the work). Also, in accordance with Executive Order 13658, the minimum wage for certain federal contractors is $10.20 per hour as of January 1, 2017.

The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.

Evaluation Criteria include:
Criterion 1 - Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services
Offerors will be evaluated in terms of the qualifications, competence and experience of the key personnel and technical team proposed to accomplish this work.

Example projects shall note project s square footage.  All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed for each team member proposed to manage and/or perform work under this contract.  To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF 330 Part 1, Section F Item 25  Firms from Section C Involved in this Project,  block (1). Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21.  Include an e-mail and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c).  Include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above.  If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work they provided towards the performance of the overall project.  If a project was performed by a joint venture, and not all joint venture partners are on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract.  Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the team member/team entity on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.
NOTE: If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) projects for this criterion. Projects shall be submitted on the SF330.  For submittal purposes, a Task Order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project. Instead, list relevant completed Task Orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above. Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement may not be evaluated. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being rated lower. 
All information for Criterion 2 should be submitted in Part 1, Section F of the SF 330. The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part 1, Section F in evaluating Criterion 2.

Criterion 3   Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project.  For this procurement, the firm must be located within the five (5) state region of Nebraska, Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota, or Minnesota

Criterion 4   Past Performance of the A/E firm and partners on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules
Evaluating past performance and experience will include information provided in Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) or CPARS/ACASS for Criterion 1 projects and may include other information provided by the A/E firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criteria.  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a lower rating.  NOTE: Past performance information should be provided only for projects listed under Criterion 1.
SUBMIT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION FOR EACH PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1.  IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion   1.  AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS IS AVAILABLE.  IF A CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.  Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF 330.  If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, offerors should complete and submit with their responses the first page of the PPQ (Attachment), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors may submit a PPQ previously submitted under a different Notice/RFP (legible copies are acceptable) if it is on the same form as posted with this Synopsis.  Offerors should follow up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If requested by the client, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Network Contracting Office 23, Attn: Kenneth Spohn via email at kenneth.spohn@va.gov prior to the response date.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their response PPQs or CPARS previously submitted in response to other A/E services procurements.

<p>PROPRIETARY INFORMATION:</p>
<p>The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this market survey. The Government acknowledges its obligations under Federal Acquisition Regulation 3.104-4 (18 U.S.C. &sect;1905) to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br />1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all<br />caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.</p>
<p>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (excessive breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting, or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate, when only portions of an electronic file are proprietary, use the restrictive legends &lsquo;PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."</p>
<p>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</p>
<p>6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</p>

<RESPDATE>051819
<CONTACT>Danny Cohn, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014027111, Email danny.cohn@nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) NO. NIH-NIDA-NINDS-19-5221036, ENTITLED: "Clinical Support Services for the Research Efforts of the Stroke Branch, Section on Stroke Diagnostics and Therapeutics, NINDS, NIH" WILL BE ISSUED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON OR ABOUT May 20, 2019. <br /><br />It is anticipated that up to two (2) cost-reimbursement contracts will result from the issuance of the solicitation. The government anticipates issuing the solicitation under full and open competition. <br /><br />Purpose: <br />The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire the services of up to two acute care hospital(s) (hereafter identified as the Contractor) located within 15 miles of the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD (9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892) to support the research efforts of the NIH/NINDS Stroke Branch, Section on Stroke Diagnostics and Therapeutics (hereafter identified as NIH Team). The overall program is designed to study the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the clinical evaluation of acute stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients, and to develop acute stroke therapies. Although the Contractor will not be developing or conducting any of the research under this program, they will be providing clinical services and support including but not limited to: 24/7 standard clinical care for stroke and TBI patients, patient identification and referral; MRI and CT support for imaging of prospective patients for referral and research subjects; vascular neurology physician services; nurse coordinator services; emergency preparation and blinding of study drugs by a hospital pharmacist; chemistry and hematological laboratory tests required by the NIH Team research protocols; general radiological services; neurosurgical and neuroradiological services; interventional radiology services; neuro-intensive care and monitoring. This contract will only reimburse the services necessary to support the research initiated and conducted by the NIH Team. <br /><br />Background:<br />This acquisition will provide acute care hospital setting for NIH Team staff to recruit, enroll, study and treat acute stroke and TBI patients. This project is a continuation of a long-term (15+ years) collaborative effort the NIH Team has had with two local hospitals to provide clinical support services to facilitate research into acute cerebrovascular diseases and TBI. The NIH Team will recruit patients who present to the Contractor's hospital with symptoms of an acute stroke or TBI and will employ use of non-invasive MRI methodologies to evaluate the disease and help develop new therapies for the treatment of these diseases. The research protocols conducted at these sites are designed and performed by the NIH Team. The services provided by the Contractor to the NIH team are standard clinical services, nothing innovative or unique, and Contractor staff will not be required to analyze or interpret data based on the NINDS research protocol objectives.<br /><br />Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform the scope of the contract requirement, including the following:<br /><br />1. Elements of Stroke Unit: The Contractor shall provide beds for patients on the Stroke Service with ICU level and ICU-step with appropriate levels of neuroscience nursing staffing and beds equipped with standard cardiovascular and neurointensive monitoring equipment. <br />2. Designation as Research Team: The Contractor shall recognize the NIH Team as the designated research team. It is understood that the research activities of the NIH Team may not involve all patients with acute cerebrovascular and/or TBI disease. <br />Upon approval of the NIH Team, Contractor staff may participate as associate investigators of the NIH Team's research protocols. Interdepartmental collaboration will be essential to the goals of this contract and enhance the research. The Contractor shall foster and facilitate an adequate and acceptable collaboration between the NIH Team and the other hospital departments, and between the NIH Team and private practice physicians. For conflicts over research issues, priority shall be given to the specifics of protocols approved by NIH and the Contractor's IRB committees. Except for emergency or life-threatening situations, no deviation in the care specified by an approved research protocol shall be instituted (i.e., no orders written) by a physician without prior discussion and agreement by the NIH Team's research protocol medically responsible investigator.<br />3. Patient Referral: The Contractor's Emergency Department and/or Contractor's Stroke Team shall facilitate the referral of acute stroke and/or TBI patients for possible enrollment into the NIH Team's research protocols. Upon identification of appropriate patients specified in the NIH Team's research protocols, the Contractor's staff shall promptly notify the NIH Team for possible recruitment into a research protocol. The ability of the hospital to meet the patient referral will be reviewed quarterly. The NIH Team shall be provided with access to patient demographic and admission information to determine whether compliance with the referral rate is being met. Inadequate referral activity that jeopardizes the success of the NIH research protocols may preclude the Government from exercising any future options under the contract. <br />4. Support Staff and Ancillary Services: Other hospital-based services shall be provided to support standard stroke care and are essential elements of Joint Commission certified Primary or Comprehensive Stroke Centers. These include, but are not limited to, nursing, neurosurgery, interventional neuroradiology, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. The cost associated with such support is the responsibility of the Contractor. <br />5. MRI Facility and Equipment: A major research focus of this program is the use of MRI in the evaluation and investigation of stroke and traumatic brain injury patients. Thus, a state-of-the-art MRI scanner (3T) and facility is critical for the program's needs. <br />a. Patient Preparation Area - This area shall be used to prepare, examine, and interview patients. The room shall be capable of patient exams, minor procedures and general patient preparation.<br />b. Patient Treatment Area - This area shall be used to monitor or treat patients with standard or experimental therapies while within the MRI facility. Cardiovascular monitoring equipment and emergency resuscitation equipment (&lsquo;crash cart') will be available in this area. This area will be stocked with sufficient supplies of medications required by the NIH Team. A nurse will be available whenever needed to assist in monitoring patients undergoing studies in the MRI facility.<br />c. MRI Facility Location - The state-of-the art MRI scanner shall be located near the Emergency Department such that patient transport from the Emergency Department to the MRI facility can readily and routinely be accomplished in less than 5 minutes. The scanner shall be available 24/7 for use in the evaluation of acute stroke and TBI patients. Access to the state-of-the art MRI scanner by NIH Team shall include scheduled research time during normal operating hours (M-F 8a-7p), and additional hours may be scheduled for other times. The MRI scanner shall be immediately accessible for emergency evaluation of stroke patients (no greater than 15-minute delay between notification of technologist of emergency stroke case and scanner readiness for the patient). Access to the MRI scanner by the NIH Team for emergency, clinical follow-up, or research scans, will not require approval by the Contractor's radiologist or other staff. Outside of normal operating hours, the scanner shall be available for NIH Team stroke research studies. Use of the MRI scanner by the NIH Team may not be limited in any manner by the Contractor. <br />d. Scanner Upgrades - Contractor shall be responsible for coordinating and implementing required scanner upgrades as necessary. The NIH Team shall be kept informed of any contemplated maintenance, changes, or upgrades to the MRI system. No changes shall take place without the input and agreement of the NIH Team. Payment of upgrade and maintenance costs with the use of contract funds will be determined on a case-by-case basis. <br />6. Radiology Services: In addition to MRI unit, the Contractor shall provide 24 hour access for clinical scanning of stroke patients in a state-of-the-art CT scanner for stroke patients including capacity for CT angiography and CT perfusion. <br />Clinical stroke imaging protocols will be determined through collaboration and agreement between the NIH Team and the Contractor's radiologists.<br />The Contractor shall make available 24-hour interventional neuroradiologist coverage with emergency on-call neuroradiological services for image interpretation or interventional procedures. The requirement for interventional procedures will always be available for emergency diagnostic angiography and intra-arterial thrombolysis of cerebral arteries and other endovascular therapies and research collaborations. Contractor's neuroradiologists shall provide stat reads of emergency CT scans and MRI scans. The neuroradiological services may also, at the NIH Team's designation, be provided by NIH personnel in addition to the Contractor's personnel, and the contractor would not limit granting of clinical privileges or access to required hospital resources to such designees without just cause.<br />7. Medical Staff Privileges and Billing: Upon request and following standard application and review, the Contractor shall grant clinical privileges to NIH personnel to perform clinical services and procedures for which they have adequate training and experience in support of the clinical and research needs of the NIH Team. Such privileges and/or access to required hospital resources shall not be denied for reasons of competition with other Contractor's staff or clinical services for any reasons other than professional competency. NIH employed physicians will not charge or bill for their clinical services and the Contractor may not bill for NIH employed physicians either directly or indirectly. The Contractor shall not hire for employment any member of the NIH Team while that member is an NIH employee or within 1 year of termination of NIH employment, without prior permission of the NIH team.<br />8. Training: The NIH Stroke Program has an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) vascular neurology residency program. The Contractor shall agree to enter into a Program Letter of Agreement with NIH to allow the NIH vascular neurology residents to do inpatient and outpatient rotations at the Contractor's site. The Contractor shall provide vascular neurologist(s), at least one of whom shall be American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) Board Certified in Vascular Neurology, to serve as faculty for this training program and to assist with the education and training of the NIH vascular neurology residents during their inpatient and outpatient rotations. Contractor shall provide sufficient resources (faculty, space and other ancillary support) to ensure the outpatient rotation provides valuable teaching experience for the NIH vascular neurology residents. <br />9. Community Outreach: The hospital shall provide, at no cost to the Government, community outreach services to educate the potential patient population in the Contractor's community about stroke prevention and treatment, about the NIH clinical care and research programs and to foster a receptive attitude toward participation in NIH research studies.<br />10. In-service Training: The NIH Team shall be responsible for training Contractor's clinical staff members in the NIH Team's research protocol requirements. Sufficient time and access to the Contractor's clinical staff to provide education and training regarding research protocols shall be provided.<br />11. Non-transfer of Acute Patients: The Contractor shall seek designation with the various HMO plans to be recognized as an acute stroke center for that provider. This will help reduce the number of patients who are transferred from the Contractor's emergency room or within 24 hours of admission to another hospital because of insurance membership constraints. <br />12. Patient follow-up after hospital discharge: Patients seen by the NIH Team will be referred to an appropriate physician for follow-up (non-research related) care. The NIH Team will need to maintain contact with the patient once they are enrolled in a research protocol and will contact or see patients in follow-up for the purpose and according to the requirements of the research protocols.<br />13. Research Pharmacist Availability: It is anticipated that drug treatment research protocols will require emergency preparation and blinding of study material (drug or placebo) by a pharmacist. Thus, during the activity of such protocols, a pharmacist must be available always in hospital (24/7) to perform the functions required by the protocol on an emergency basis. Only actual effort associated with preparing study materials or providing research pharmacy services as related to implementation of research protocols shall be an allowable cost to the contract.<br />14. Diagnostic Tests/Supplies/Services: The majority of diagnostic tests shall be performed as part of clinical services and thus not reimbursable cost under this contract. It is anticipated that research protocols may require chemistry or hematological laboratory tests to be performed and reported urgently (stat) that may not typically be considered stat. Thus, the laboratory shall make available the resources to perform the tests required by the research protocols and in a manner required by the protocols. The Contractor shall provide these tests as required by the research protocols. The costs for any diagnostic tests related to the research protocols shall be allowable costs under this contract. The NIH Stroke Team may elect to send their research laboratory tests to an outside facility for processing. <br />15. Costs of patient transfer from another facility: The cost of transferring a patient by air or land from another facility to the Contractor's hospital may not be passed on to the Government unless the primary reason for the transfer is participation in an approved research protocol of the NIH Team and the research participation was initiated (e.g., inform consent obtained) prior to the transfer.<br />16. Division of Cost Responsibility: The cost requirements of the program that are of clinical necessity (e.g., routine clinical care, maintenance of stroke center certification) shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. <br />Any cost to establish and maintain emergency and inpatient clinical, laboratory, and radiological services as required to maintain stroke center certification shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. This will include any costs of upgrading or expanding human or equipment resources not currently available or sufficient to meet the needs of the care of stroke patients.<br />The cost of those elements required by the research protocols of the program shall be the responsibility of the Government and shall be allowable costs under this contract. <br />Note, if a patient's insurance company declines to pay for a clinical service the cost of that service will not be reimbursed under this contract.<br />17. Research Costs: Research patient care costs shall be reimbursed by this contract in accordance with, if applicable, the Contractor's HHS negotiated research patient care rate agreement. In absence of such agreement the research patient care costs will be reimbursed by this contract at the Medicare reimbursement rate. <br />18. IRB Approval: All research performed by the NIH Team shall be reviewed and approved according to IRB requirements for NIH and the Contractor. <br />19. Computer Networks: The Contractor shall allow and facilitate the NIH network to be installed at their hospital site. The Contractor's CT scanners and MRI scanners shall be made accessible to NIH computer network. All NIH Team office facilities at the Contractor's Hospital shall require high speed computer links with the NIH's and Contractor's computer networks. <br />20. Proprietary Research Data: The resulting research data collected shall be proprietary to NIH Team except for medical necessity. Any use of the research data collected by the NIH Team cannot be used by non-NIH personnel for scientific, academic, educational, commercial or other purposes without the permission of the NIH Team and in accordance with NIH policy. <br />21. Space Requirements: Adequate office space and office furnishings for 8-10 members of the NIH Team shall be provided on hospital premises by the Contractor. This space shall be in proximity to the MRI facility and the Stroke Unit. During the contract period the clinical and research activities and staffing of the program may grow. If space requirements of the NIH Team increase, sufficient and acceptable space and furnishings shall be made available to the NIH Team. If the Contractor requires relocation of the NIH Team offices, the costs of relocation and renovation to a comparable space shall be the responsibility of Contractor. This office space shall be computer network accessible to both the Contractor's and NIH's computer networks.<br />22. Clinical Research Infrastructure: The Contractor shall provide the clinical infrastructure to support the research protocols of the NIH Team as discussed in the general and specific requirements of this statement of work. In addition, the Contractor shall provide medical records support to ensure that copies of consents generated by the NIH Team are incorporated into the appropriate hospital medical records. <br />23. Reporting Requirements: The Contractor shall prepare and deliver written quarterly reports on the numbers and types of patients referred to NIH Team. These reports shall be electronically delivered to the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer Representative (COR).<br />24. Publicizing Relationship: The Contractor shall get prior written approval from Contracting Officer to publicize, or to use for marketing purposes, their relationship or association with NIH/NINDS.<br />25. Program Management and Control Requirements: The Contractor shall appoint either a senior administrator or Stroke Center Medical Director as Principal Investigator (PI) to serve as a liaison between the NIH Team, Contractor's corporate management and clinical support staff. In addition, if NIH Team deems necessary, monthly meetings shall occur between the PI and NIH staff to assure referral of patients, contract compliance and support of the NIH clinical and research protocols.<br /><br />The NINDS anticipates awarding up to two (2) cost-reimbursement contracts with a one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods, for a total period of performance of up to five (5) years, if all options are exercised. There is no obligation for the NINDS to exercise any Option Period; NINDS may end the contract after the Base Period or after any Option Period.<br /><br />Offerors are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) when submitting an offer or quotation, and shall continue to be registered until time of award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from a solicitation.<br /><br />Processing time should be taken into consideration when registering.

<DESC>A Design for Maritime Superiority (2018) describes an operational architecture for distributed maritime operations (DMO) that "... will provide accurate, timely, and analyzed information to units, warfighting groups, and fleets."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A critical component of this architecture is the tactical grid to connect distributed units into groups and distributed groups into fleets. Communications and networking technologies that can provide seamless, robust, connectivity are key enablers for the tactical grid. These technologies will be deployed on a variety of platforms, both manned and unmanned, operating under challenging battlefield conditions (lack of infrastructure, mobility, spectrum limitations, interference, multipath, atmospherics, size/weight/power constraint, etc.) in different environments (land, maritime [includes both surface and undersea], and space).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Successful Command and Control (C2) and decision making, at all levels of command, for DMO is critically dependent on these communications and networking technologies.
<p>The goal of the Communications and Networking Program within the Office of Naval Research (ONR 311) is to support the Navy's Information Warfare vision by developing measurable advances in technology that can directly enable and enhance end-to-end connectivity and quality-of-service for mission-critical information exchange among widely dispersed naval, joint, and coalition forces. The vision is to provide high throughput robust communications and networking to ensure all warfighters - from the operational command to the tactical edge - have access to information, knowledge, and decision-making necessary to perform their assigned tasks.</p>

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Baltimore District, Real Property Services Field Office (RSFO) has a requirement for a design-bid-build (DBB) construction services to be procured under a Two-Step Invitation for Bid (IFB) process. The NAICS code is 236220 with a size standard of $36,000,000.</p>
<p>The Government intend to award a Firm-Fixed-Price contract only to one contractor.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: Design-bid-build (DBB) construction services for a MILCON project to construct a training campus consisting of a team room building, a classroom building, ready bay building, troop aid station building, and a medical training building. These buildings will be slab on grade construction with a pre-engineered building (PEB) structure. The existing operations center building and latrine building will also be renovated. The total square footage of new building construction is approximately 36,500 SF. The total square footage of buildings to be renovated is approximately 13,500 SF. Supporting facilities include all site-related work to include stormwater management and parking, utilities to each building, and demolition of existing structures at the project site.</p>
<p>The period of performance is 548 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>In accordance with DFARS 236.204 - Disclosure of the Magnitude of Construction Projects, the magnitude of this project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.</p>
<p>This will be a Two-Step Sealed Bid Process. The two-step procedure is designed to obtain the benefits of sealed bidding by awarding a contract to the lowest price, responsive, responsible offeror. A firm-fixed-price contract will be awarded to the responsive and responsible Bidder, whom the Government determined had an acceptable STEP 1 proposal, conforms to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable, and bids the lowest price.</p>
<p>STEP 1 under this bidding process consists of the request for, submission, evaluation, and (if necessary) discussion of a technical proposal. Only one technical proposal may be submitted by each offeror. The proposals are evaluated for technical acceptability. The technical proposal shall not include prices or pricing information. The Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal as submitted. The Government may proceed with the second step without requesting further information from any offeror; however, the Government may request additional information from offerors of proposals that it considers reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable, and may discuss proposals with their offerors. A notice of unacceptability will be forwarded to the offeror upon completion of the proposal evaluation and final determination of unacceptability.</p>
<p>In the STEP 2, the normal sealed bid process will be followed. Only bids based upon technical proposals determined to be acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions in Step One, will be considered for award. Each bid in STEP 2 must be based on the bidder's own technical proposal. Each bidder shall comply with the specifications and the bidder's technical proposal.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that STEP 1 will be released on or about 20 MAY 2019. The solicitation will be provided in an electronic format, free of charge to all authenticated account holders of Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) System. Step Two of the solicitation will be provided via amendment and will only be available to those offerors selected to advance.</p>
<p>Contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM) database to receive a Government contract award. Contractors must also be registered in Representations and Certifications Applications (included in SAM). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this acquisition must be in vendor's SAM registration.</p>
<p>Note: Update SAM profile to include all applicable NAICS Codes associated with your company. Vendors may register for SAM online at www.sam.gov or by calling 1-866-606-8220</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Request for Information - FA8630-19-S-6010</strong><br /><br /><strong>THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE.</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates an (competitive or noncompetitive) acquisition to provide:</p>
<p>Enterprise Content Management (ECM) is what AFSAC utilizes to deliver content (such as common office types i.e. PDF, XLS, etc.) to FMS stakeholders. The current ECM solution that is being utilized is ASG Report.Web, which allows AFSAC to manage and deliver financial reports, logistic reports and technical order documents to AFSAC's foreign partners around the globe. AFSAC has been utilizing this solution since April 2003 and in March 2019, ASG announced the sunset of this program, which will end all support for this ECM. The requirement is to provide a specialized distribution repository with powerful enterprise archiving and records management. The ECM must provide the necessary software, license, material, documentation and electronic delivery of content for AFSAC stakeholders in support of AFLCMC/WFR ECM modernization; with the ability to migrate current business rules from the existing product into the new product solution. The ECM must also have a Certificate of Networthiness (CON) and be on the Air Force Approved Software List.</p>
<p>Support. Contractor will need to provide an ECM product solution that is a specialized distribution repository with powerful enterprise archiving and records management. In addition, the product solution must provide the necessary software, license, material, documentation and electronic delivery of content for AFSAC stakeholders in support of AFLCMC/WFR ECM modernization. The contractor will need to provide training to assigned AFSAC personnel.</p>
<p>Infrastructure. The contractor shall provide an ECM product solution that can review the current environment, develop a migration plan, install/configure a new ECM with Virtual Printing Service (VPS), test end-to-end, provide knowledge transfer to AFSAC personnel and supply Site Configuration Documentation detailing architecture of the new environment, Active Migration Support and Migration Performance, Audit Trail, and Minimal Business Impact. Specifically, the product solution will provide expertise in providing Independent Verification and Validation analysis and code review of the ECM modernization. Verification is to ensure the ECM meets business rules and user requirements, has built in compliance of all Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs), and operates as a system without manual processes and manual system intervention. The VPS is required to capture data from Mainframe print queues, burst them into reports for customer delivery to AFSAC foreign partner customers, and interact with our existing systems.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Each company responding should indicate their business size: other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and/or HUBZone in accordance with the stated NAICS code and size standard.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this acquisition is 511210, Software Publishers, with a size standard of 1000 employees. Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard.</p>
<p>All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract.</p>
<p>Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this request for information is voluntary. This request for information notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</p>
<p>Product Solution. All interested firms who wants to be considered for any resulting contract should submit a product solution that outlines the required product specification listed in the RFI. The product solution should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. The response must not exceed 10 pages with 12-point font with at least 1" margins.</p>
<p>Submit request for information packages via e-mail to Carl Henderson at carl.henderson.5@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Modernization". If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email.<br /><br />An AFLCMC Wright-Patterson Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from respondents and others for this request for information. Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer for resolution. In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, will be included in this RFI. The AFLCMC Wright-Patterson Ombudsman is Lt. Col. Brian Miller; (937) 255-5512 or brian.miller.5@us.af.mil.<br /><br />Questions related to this request for information must be submitted via e-mail to Mr. Carl Henderson at carl.henderson.5@us.af.mil NLT COB 10 May 2019. No further questions will be entertained after that date.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 18 MAY 2019, 4 p.m. EST.</strong></p>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (market survey).  This is not a request for quote (RFQ) or a request for proposal (RFP).  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.  The Government will not pay for any cost incurred in responding to this announcement.  Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought synopsis shall be voluntary.
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is for Market Research purposes only.  The information submitted in response to the Sources Sought Notice will not be utilized to determine vendor standing in any future/potential Request for Quote/Request for Proposal, nor will it be utilized to determine if a vendor is qualified to submit a Request for Quote/Request for Proposal for any future/potential requirement.  The notice and the information received shall not be used to determine how well respondents can perform a requirement, which can only be evaluated in response to a solicitation.  Vendors will not receive formal notification or feedback on any information submitted in this Sources Sought request.  All future/proposed submissions/solicitations requirements solicited on a Government Point of Entry will be evaluated independent of any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice.  No vendor will be provided information on solicitations issued on a Government Point of Entry based on this Sources Sought request.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is relative to the NAICS code 315990.  The Small Business size standard for this NAICS code is 500 employees.  Large and Small Businesses are invited to answer this market survey to determine market capabilities.</p>
<p>This sources sought is issued to find potential sources capable of providing B-TEK Workhorse truck scales (or equal). Project will include removal and replacement of current Cardinal Truck Scales with the new B-TEK scales (or equal) as well as installing new B-TEK (or equal) scales. The installation will require construction work.</p>
<p>Attached is the draft Statement of Work. In addition to the requirements addressed in the Draft Statement of Work, a soil test will be required so that a structural engineer can design the foundation for the new floor scale. Since the location of the new floor scale is being installed in a facility that currently has a 6" slab over a capillary water barrier on compacted fill, we do not anticipate there being any unsuitable soil conditions encountered. The original building foundation was designed for a maximum soil pressure of 2,000 PSF with 2'-0" minimum footing width.</p>

The purpose of this SS is to conduct Market Research to determine an acquisition strategy for a one-time firm fixed-priced purchase order to purchase two CO2 incubators.

The Research Service located at the Cincinnati VAMC needs to procure two CO2 incubator to perform experiments.

Currently we have four lab members actively doing cell culture in two incubators, and they have constant humidity and CO2 maintenance issues, due to which we sometimes have only one functional one.  The cell incubators are already crowded at times, and with new students joining the lab this summer through the University of Cincinnati s Summer Undergraduate Research Program, we are sure to have more cell culture incubator users on the way.


The cell culture incubator maintains the proper temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels necessary to culture healthy mammalian cells in order to perform all cell based experiments. For our xenograft animal model too, we first need to grow sufficient cells to inject the animals and grow the tumor. 


The cell culture incubator is used to both maintain cell populations, and to keep cells healthy under various experiments.

  Maintaining health mammalian cells. This incubator must be able to maintain a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius and a CO2 level of 5%. 

  Sterilization of system. The incubator must also have racks which can be disassembled and removed for proper cleaning with 70% ethanol once a week. The inside walls of this incubator must also be able to handle a 70% ethanol cleaning once a week. They should be autoclavable or heat sterilizable.

Potential sources must demonstrate experience and knowledge of required services and
capability to provide such services. Potential sources should submit:
  business name and address;
  point of contact;
  business size, and any applicable business socio-economic category;
  capability statement;
  provide information for recent and relevant projects similar in nature;

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought for potential expansion of a Supply Chain Management Contract for TF33 Engine Support
<SOLNBR>To_Be_Advised_at_Time_of_Issuance_FHZ
<RESPDATE>051019
<CONTACT>Richard D. Alexander, Acquisition Specialist, Phone 8042795059, Email richard.alexander@dla.mil
<DESC>DISCLAIMER: THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS POTENTIAL SOURCES SOUGHT (PSS) OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.<br /><br />This PSS is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. The Government requires that only non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for the use of any proprietary information submitted. Responses to the PSS will not be returned. The responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this PSS. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this PSS.
<p>PURPOSE: This Sources Sought Notice is issued as a means of conducting market research to determine if other companies, besides Pratt &amp; Whitney, are capable of integrating with ongoing efforts to provide performance-based logistics (PBL) support for the TF33 Engine Platform to include, but not limited to, support of cold start items on the TF33. The TF33 powers the USAF B-52 aircraft among other aircraft. The proposed contract action is for additional PBL support for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to support the objectives by responding to this notice. All responses received by the notice response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Information received in response to this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or commitment by the Government. The Government intends to expand its partnership with the PBL provider to include supply support, demand planning, forecasting, material management, engineering support and sustainment elements, packaging, storage/warehousing, reliability improvements, and field customer service/engineering support of the TF33 Engine manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney, and the associated TF33 Bill of Materials (BOM) of DLA managed consumable parts to support United States Air Force (USAF) customers. This expansion is under existing subsumable contract SPE4AX19D9417. This contract action will be a Requirements-type, Firm Fixed Price Contract, for a period up to five years.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES: The overarching objectives of this acquisition are to decrease TF33 Engine repair delays due to outstanding consumable requirements, and fill requisitions within material availability priorities by emphasizing improvement of lead times for cold start items. In order to meet these objectives, the contractor must have the ability to integrate with the "cleanse and analysis" of the entire BOM to identify cold start and other items that pose a challenge to meeting lead times, analyze drawings for any/all items to determine if updates are required, identify sources in the supply base to build the items as well as identify any tooling needed, drive changes into the weapons system configuration, and understand, analyze, and assess the implications-both in terms of performance and operational usage-of any potential configuration change. In addition, the contractor will be required to make recommendations for Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) along with being responsible for obsolescence management and mitigating Diminishing Manufacturing Source (DMSMS) challenges for the TF33 Bill of Materials (BOM).</p>
<p>The contractor must have the ability to perform an In-Depth NSN analysis of the TF33 BOM to identify potential Sourcing and Tooling issues, Processes, Engineering Stability, Executability, and build the TF33 Cold Start NSN population. The contractor must have the ability to perform a tooling availability, location, condition assessment, and provide a recommended tooling solution if required, for each Cold Start NSN. The contractor must have the ability to Identify/ Develop/ Update Technical Data Packages (TDP) &amp; Build to Packages (BTP) for each Cold Start NSN. In addition, the contractor must have the ability to identify/develop and warm the supply chain on all Cold Start NSNs with the goal to ensure the supply chain is ready to respond once an order is placed. The contractor will combine current usage data, replacement factors and their Cold Start NSN analysis, forecast, and make buy recommendations (buy time/quantity) to DLA/USAF on Cold Start NSNs.</p>
<p>Performance metrics associated with this acquisition may be tied to material availability improvements as well as reliability improvements and backorder management.</p>
<p>The contract will allow for an expansion of support based on developing and evolving TF33 Engine requirements from DLA and/or USAF. The material list is attached as part of this Sources Sought. However, the list may increase based on the results of the BOM Analysis.</p>
<p>RESPONSES: The Government requires that only non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for the use of any proprietary information submitted.<br />1. Responses are required by no later than 10 May 2019.<br />2. Reponses must include the following information:<br />a. Company Name<br />b. Address<br />c. CAGE Code<br />d. Point of Contact<br />e. Phone<br />f. Email<br />g. Web page URL, if available<br />h. Small business type or category you represent, if applicable.<br />i. Identify as a U.S. or Foreign Owned Entity<br />j. Indicate whether your interest is a prime contractor or as a subcontractor<br />3. Respondents must address:<br />a. Their capability to satisfy all objectives listed above, to include a description of the extent and content of prior experience on PBL efforts that are similar in nature and scope and,<br />b. Their experience with the TF 33 Engine.<br />c. Their access to engineering and logistics data for the TF33 Engine.<br />d. Their transition and implementation actions and timeframes to successfully execute the anticipated requirements of this acquisition.<br />e. Willingness to provide upfront pricing for full term of contract</p>
<p>SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION: Responses to this Sources Sought Notice must be readable by Microsoft Office or Adobe software. Response this Sources Sought Notice shall be unclassified and not exceed 20 pages in length. Please note: emails containing file types such as .zip, .xlsx, .docx, or other macro-enabled extension, may not be delivered to the intended recipient.

<p>Federal Bureau of Investigation Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG)</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG) is conducting market research to obtain access to a Forensic Psychiatrist in the area of Behavioral Science and conflict resolution to successfully conduct FBI investigations through the use of consultation services regarding bizarre, vicious, or repetitive crimes; training on these specialized topics; advice on current and future research projects; and operational assistance responding to critical incidents.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the FBI is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Vendors are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.

<DESC><strong>Description: </strong>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p><strong>Background:&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify;">The National Insitute of Mental Health (NIMH) Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) for early psychosis is an evidence-based, multi-component team intervention that has been shown to improve clinical and functioning outcomes, reduce inpatient days, and potentially also reduce costs, among young people who are identified and engaged in treatment soon after initial onset of psychotic symptoms. The number of CSC programs in the United States has increased twenty-fold over the last decade, supported in part by research studies initiated by the NIMH as well as dedicated funding from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA) Community Mental Health Services Block Grant program. Currently, almost every state has at least one CSC program, with a total of more than 260 nationwide.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">While this growth has made CSC services much more widely available, it is important to recognize that most programs are in urban areas and that many persons in need of this intervention may live some distance from the CSC program, which limits access to needed interventions. As such, it may be particularly valuable to utilize patient-empowering technology (PET) to facilitate various components of the CSC intervention, to maintain and enhance engagement, reduce patient and family burden, and ultimately improve outcomes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives: </strong>The purpose of this acquisition is to review and evaluatie currently available digital health technology applications to identify any that may be directly suitable, or readily adaptable, for use in augmenting the delivery of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC)  for early psychosis, including extending CSC services into underserved areas.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The Contractor shall provide the following sevices:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall survey the scientific and health technology literature to identify digital technology applications that have been applied to facilitate the key roles, clinical services, and core functions of CSC for early psychosis. Components of CSC are outlined in the NIMH white paper, "Evidence-Based Treatments for First Episode Psychosis: Components of Coordinated Specialty Care" (https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/raise/nimh-white-paper-csc-for-fep_147096.pdf). <br />The contractor shall identify and/or develop a standardized, reliable, multidimensional evaluation process to classify, and rate the quality and evidence of relevant PETS.  Evaluation factors might include: ease of use, reliability, quality, efficiency, evidence base,  effectiveness, security, engagement, customization, cost, and suitability to the CSC environment. <br /><br />The contractor shall identify PETS that meet core requirements and are directly suitable, or readily adaptable, for implementation in augmenting the delivery of CSC for early psychosis, including extending CSC services into underserved populations. From the list of promising digital technology applictions, develop probe questions to structure needs assessment interviews with a sample of CSC providers and service users.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall identify at least 8 CSC clinics from the pool of ~265 programs supported through SAMHSA's Mental Health Block Grant set-aside for first episode psychosis programs. (See "Snapshot of State Plans for Using the Community Mental Health Block Grant 10 Percent Set-Aside to Address First Episode Psychosis".) CSC programs selected should represent geographically disparate and ethnically diverse patient populations.  The Contractor shall conduct a needs assessment with at least 3 providers and 4 patients at each of these clinics to determine if and how PETS might be integrated into the CSC care pathway.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall utilize the results of the needs assessment, identify key CSC services that might be augmented or in some cases replaced by PETS. For example: technology to promote medication adherence, increase engagement in care, efficiently connect patients and providers, deliver vocational/educational rehabilitation, and case management services, provide crisis management, and provide case consultation.<br />The Contractor shall also provide consulting services to the NIMH as follows:</p>
<p>Provide technical assistance to NIMH leadership in identifying knowledge gaps and/or research opportunities to evaluate existing and new digital mental health technology.</p>
<p>Provide technical expertise to NIMH on conducting portfolio analyses of the existing NIMH digital health research grant portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong> 8 months from the date of award.  The contract will include two (2) options periods for an additional 12 months.</p>
<p><strong>Capability statement /information sought:</strong> Contractors that believe that they possess the ability to provide the required equipment, should submit documentation on their ability to meet each of the project requirements to the Contract Specialist.</p>
<p>The Contractor should directly and specifically state in the, capabilities statement, which project requirements can be meet and/or supplied. The Contractor must also provide their  DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HubZone, etc., pursuant to the applicable NAICS code and any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the acquisition requirements.</p>
<p>The information submitted must be must be in and outline format that addresses each of the elements of the project requirement and in the capability statement /information sought paragraphs stated herein.  A cover page and an executive summary may be included but is not required.</p>
<p>The response is limited to two (2) page limit.  The 2-page limit does not include the cover page or executive summary.</p>
<p>The response must include the respondents' technical and administrative points of contact, including names, titles, addresses, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>All responses to this notice must be submitted electronically to the Contract Specialist.  Facsimile responses are NOT accepted.</p>
<p>The response must be submitted to Jeffrey E. Brown, Contracting Officer, at jeffrey.brown@nih.gov.</p>
<p>The response must be received on or before May 13, 2019 at 12 pm, Eastern Time.</p>

<p><br />Title: National Child Welfare Capacity Building Center for Courts (Center for Courts) Support for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)/Administration for Children and Families (ACF)/Children's Bureau (CB)</p>
<p><br />Description:<br />The Children's Bureau (CB) in the Administration for Children and Families seeking interested capable sources to perform the services of the National Child Welfare Capacity Building Center for Courts (Center for Courts). The Center for Courts serves as a focal point for national child welfare expertise and evidence-informed training and technical assistance services for Court Improvement Programs (CIP), Tribal Court Improvement Programs (TCIP), courts and child welfare attorneys, and the CB's State and Tribal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) Implementation Partnership Grantees.</p>
<p><br />The Center for Courts provides nationally-informed, expert consultation to the federal government and delivers a comprehensive array of training and technical assistance services and workforce development support. These services and support are designed to build the capacities of state and tribal courts, CIPs, TCIPs and child welfare attorneys to meet federal requirements, to participate in federal monitoring and related state and tribal child welfare program improvement planning activities, to implement national child welfare policies and programs, to improve practice and service delivery, and to achieve prevention, safety, permanency, and well-being outcomes for children, youth, and families.</p>
<p>The legal and judicial community will rely on the Center for Courts for expert-level subject matter expertise in child welfare law, the role of courts and attorneys across the prevention continuum, child maltreatment, the full continuum of child welfare practices, and a range of topics related to safety, permanency, and child and family well-being. The Center for Courts will also have extensive knowledge of practice and administration in state public child welfare agencies across the country and an in-depth understanding of federal laws, funding, monitoring and requirements related to child welfare, including the Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) and Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) processes.</p>
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>CB has funded a technical assistance center for the legal and judicial community for approximately twenty years through cooperative agreements (formerly the National Resource Center for Legal and Judicial Issues, and most recently, the Child Welfare Capacity Building Center for Courts). The Children's Bureau has identified the need to provide enhanced levels of support to CIPs and TCIPs; therefore, the present cooperative agreement that ends this fiscal year will be provided as a contract moving forward, in order to , promote strategic legal and judicial workforce development. Both efforts are critical to realizing CB's goals of strengthening families through prevention and improving safety, permanency and well-being outcomes for children. This contract will be designed to serve three distinct programs and include additional responsibilities for completing legal and judicial workforce development tasks.</p>
<p>Scope of Work<br />The Contractor must be prepared to immediately and fully assume all of the responsibilities of the existing Center for Courts (providing the full array of services at its current volume of delivery within six months of contract award) so that individualized services to state and tribal courts, CIPs, and TCIPs, in particular, can continue without delay.</p>
<p>The Center for Courts employs innovative and proven strategies to:</p>
<p>1. Provide universal, targeted, and intensive capacity building training and technical assistance (T/TA) to State Court Improvement Programs and Tribal Court Improvement Programs (jointly hereafter CIPs) to build and enhance CIP capacity in continuous quality improvement (CQI) work<br />2. Engage and support CIPs in CQI efforts to improve court efficacy in child welfare proceedings and enhance collaboration between courts and child welfare agencies<br />3. Integrate service planning and delivery and achievable measurable, sustainable systemic change that results in greater safety, permanency, and well-being for children, youth and families<br />4. Promote and facilitate collaboration between CIPs and title-IV E and tribal social service agencies in work toward shared outcomes and in addressing federal requirements and other CB identified goals and priorities<br />5. Create focused, individual capacity building plans for each CIP and provide T/TA to support each CIP capacity building plan which may include credible, expert-level training and coaching on child welfare topics and practice issues to groups of child welfare legal professionals to build their knowledge, skills, and peer networking<br />6. Develop and propose annual work plans for information gathering and synthesis, product development, dissemination, national training and coaching, and peer networking activities that are driven by CIP needs and CB priorities<br />7. Design, produce and disseminate high quality, Section 508 compliant state-of-the-art, universal capacity building resources and opportunities for CIPs. In consultation with CB, the Center for Courts will draw from its work with CIPs to identify a discrete number of topics on which the Center will develop universal products to build and enhance CIP capacity. These products may include tools and toolkits, online training curricula, practice aides, project design and implementation guides, and virtual learning opportunities for practitioners. <br />8. The Center for Courts will create a timeline for the creation and dissemination of such products and use the latest technologies to maximize access, engagement, and effectiveness.<br />9. Develop publications, curricula, tools, and innovative resources based on strategic goals and plans for national dissemination<br />10. Engage CIP and TCIP creating focused, individual capacity building plans for each CIP and providing T/TA to support each CIP capacity building<br />11. Closely and effectively partner with federal staff in CB's Central and Regional Offices as well as other federally-funded technical assistance entities<br />12. Maintain competent and highly skilled staff to perform Center for Courts activities, including but not limited to national "expert level" subject matter expertise in the areas of: child welfare law, child protection, foster care and permanency, adoption and guardianship, implementation, and continuous quality improvement<br />13. Respond promptly to inquiries from the Government with accurate, well-organized, and detailed information about program activities and Center for Courts services<br />14. Deliver credible, expert-level training and coaching and host in person and virtual events on child welfare topics and practice issues to groups of child welfare legal professionals to build their knowledge, skills, and peer networking<br />15. Perform ongoing quality assurance and continuous quality improvement activities within the Center for Courts<br />16. Demonstrate accountability through accurate invoicing, routine program and fiscal reporting, including detailed analysis of cost by activity and topic</p>
<p>Additional Information<br />No more than 12 FTEs are anticipated to be necessary to assume the current level of services delivered by the Center for Courts and to achieve program objectives in the first year of the contract. The Center for Courts must be capable of serving as a focal point for national child welfare expertise and easily accessible training and technical assistance services for courts, CIPs and child welfare attorneys; responding to federal requests for information within tight timeframes; designing and delivering e-learning experiences, as well as virtual and/or in person training; providing individualized consultation to CIPs and TCIPs, conducting intensive capacity building projects to support program improvement, and delivering an array of services designed to build the capacities of CIPs and TCIPs to integrate service planning and delivery and achieve measurable, sustainable systemic change that will improve practice and service delivery, and achieve safety, permanency, and well-being outcomes for children, youth, and families.</p>

<DESC>The New York District plans to solicit and award an Invitation for bid construction project for the CEAC-Parking Structure Project in FY19.
<div>
<p>This notification serves three (3) purposes:</p>
<p>A. To notify potential bidders of the Government's intent to solicit a brand name(s) only component for this project.</p>
<p>B. To identify potential sources that can provide an equivalent to the brand name only item(s).</p>
<p>C. Notification of the Army's intent to solicit brand name components as described below.</p>
<p>1. The items described below, under summary of requirements, are embedded in the construction project.</p>
<p>The contract will be issued as a competitive Invitation for Bid solicitation. Only the components described below will be sole source, if no other sources are identified that can provide an equivalent system. In the event no equivalent sources are found, the brand name only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. A subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval for sole sourcing. Supplies of the brand name component will be provided directly to the Contractor(s) and not to the Government.</p>
<p>2. Summary of Requirements:</p>
<p>A.   Complete Monaco Fire Alarm System</p>
<p>Due to post wide compatibility issues and based on the capabilities described below of a Monaco Fire Alarm system, all new construction and renovation projects at the USMA, West Point are now featuring the latest version of the Monaco Fire Alarm Control Panel. The MAAP Plus Analog Addressable Integrated Radio Transceiver and Fire Alarm Control Panel is capable of point reporting up to 1584 addressable device points via proprietary UHF radio signal to the Monaco D-21 Enhanced Central Radio Control Alarm receiving system at West Point Fire Department Dispatch. New Fire Alarm installations include Mass Notification Systems (MNS) in accordance with DoD Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-021-01. The existing RF infrastructure provided by Monaco supports the UFC requirements for primary MNS communications. The Monaco Fire Alarm and integrated MNS system has the capability to remotely activate the in-building MNS messaging system and provide live-voice announcements directly from the D-21 Central Station at West Point Fire Dispatch.</p>
<p>Each Fire Alarm System (FAS) and Mass Notification System (MNS) shall be a complete, supervised, non-coded, analog-addressable system, installed in class A configuration per NFPA 72. The FAS/MNS shall provide point reporting to the Fire Alarm Control Panel (FACP). The FACP shall in turn provide point reporting to the Monaco D- 21 Central Receiving Station at USMA West Point Fire Department Dispatch. Point reporting, also known as point to point reporting, is the capability to relay the status of each addressable device and certain system components such as Signaling Line Circuits (SLC) to the D-21 Central Receiving Station in real time. The FAS/MNS shall be tested and perform as a critical life-safety system. The FAS/MNS shall be compatible with and shall communicate seamlessly with the D-21 Central Receiving Station, without impairing operational function or reliability of any existing FAS or MNS. Use of interfacing relays between the FACP and communications transceiver to provide point or zonal alarm trouble status shall not be permitted.</p>
<p>All devices must comply with the Aug 1997 Federal Wireless communication commissions office of engineering and technology Bulletin 65, Evaluating Compliance with the FCC Guideline's for Human Exposure to RF Electromagnetic Fields.</p>
<p>B. Best Hardware Lock Cylinders &amp; Cores (Non-Electronic)</p>
<p>Due to compatibility and consistency issues with keying at the USMA, Best lock is the USMA standard for lock hardware. This applies to locks that are not electronic and have status monitor capabilities compatible with the electronic security access system. Hardware locksets shall accommodate Best lock cylinders and cores. The Contractor shall provide cores to secure building during construction and shall turn over hardware cores to the government upon completion of construction. Government will replace Contractor cores with Best lock cylinders and cores after each area of the projects are completed is turned over to Government.</p>
<p>C. Granite: Fletcher Granite &lsquo;Tapestry' Stone</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Tapestry' granite is used on many buildings on West Point to include Eisenhower Barrack, MacArthur Barracks, Washington Hall, and Mahan Hall.  The CEAC is directly across the street from Mahan Hall and has a bridge connecting it to Mahan hall.  It is a SHPO concern that the building fits in with the overall historical aesthetic of the historical area.  If a vendor would like to propose an alternate source of Granite, they will need to submit a 3'x3' mock up that can be compared to a similar mock up of &lsquo;Tapestry' stone.  They will also need to provide information on production capability and available quantity of stone.  The &lsquo;Tapestry' specifications and information can be found at the following website: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1802/5527/files/TAPESTRY_300dpi.pdf?14209440782844567964</p>
<p>E. Wedge Barriers: RSSI-2000, 5-post</p>
<p>This barrier meets DoD standards and is currently in use on the installation. The need to maintain a consistent and uniform level of security and appearance on this historic site by using the same type and style of barrier is essential.</p>
<p>F. Communication Enhancement System (CES)</p>
<p>The first responder two-way radios used at West Point are Motorola and they need to be compatible with the booster antennas installed in the facility.  Currently the installation's radios are compatible with the Motorola Solutions Communication Enhancement System.</p>
<p>3. Any vendor that wishes to provide an alternate source to the brand names above that is compatible with the above must provide a response with data supporting the claim within 15 business days of this announcement to New York District Corps of Engineering, Contracting Division.</p>
<p>4. This is a market survey and notification of intent only. This is not a request to respond to a solicitation. This requirement will be solicited at a future date.</p>

<DESC><br />This special notice references the ARL BAA which can be found at Grants.gov or FBO.gov document: W911NF-17-S-0003.
<p>Synopsis: The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is planning to consider proposed research and development solutions submitted under the ARL Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Basic and Applied Scientific Research topic Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) under the Information Sciences Campaign (section II.A.4.k.) in support of new technologies and translational research-based approaches in two (2) areas (1) Expeditionary Maneuver and (2) Air/Ground Reconnaissance.</p>
<p>1. AI/ML Research for Expeditionary Maneuver<br />Problem: How do Intelligent Systems reason about, interact with, navigate through, and manipulate a dynamic environment (to include the unknown physical world) to achieve complex Army relevant actions for the future multi-domain battlespace?</p>
<p><br /> Specific Areas of Interest:<br />&bull;	Methods to learn physics abstractions of objects from observations and to learn and validate models through interaction with the environment.<br />&bull;	Ability to infer, learn, and model the dynamics of complex objects, including humans, to include predicted outcomes of their physical interactions with the intelligent system.<br />&bull;	Enhanced physical scene understanding, through physical probing and learned experiences, for enabling maneuver and interaction planning for complex and resilient maneuvers and behaviors.</p>
<p><br />2. AI/ML Research for Air/Ground Reconnaissance<br />Problem: How do diverse, embodied agents collectively sense, infer, reason, plan, and execute in collaboration with Army warfighters and in the face of a peer adversary? Additionally, how to extend the reach, situational awareness, and operational effectiveness of Army Intelligent System/Soldier teams against dynamic threats in complex and contested environments.</p>
<p>Specific Areas of Interest:<br />&bull;	Intelligent systems that can learn and adapt to dynamic changes in the environment<br />&bull;	Self-organizing teams based on mission goals and available systems that can compose and share representations of the world to coordinate on the local and global level<br />&bull;	Ability to learn and interact with humans at multiple levels<br />&bull;	Systems that learn perception-action-communication loops to adapt and modify behaviors as the mission demands and the communication constraints and the data allows</p>
<p>Innovative research solutions are sought in the areas described above under section II.A.4.k. of the ARL BAA.

<DESC>BF Sisk Dam Safety of Dams Modifications Industry Day Notice

NOTICE: This is not a solicitation. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Region will host an Industry Day for the BF Sisk Dam Safety of Dams (SOD) Modifications Project. This project will be awarded in multiple phases, the first of which is scheduled for Fall of 2020.

The purpose of this Industry Day is to improve the Industrys understanding of Reclamations requirements, answer questions on the BF Sisk Dam SOD project, and solicit feedback from industry as part of our market research.

Projected Requirement Details:
The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), a water management agency within the Department of the Interior, desires to engage the heavy civil construction industry to provide a clear, concise, fair, and reasonable approach regarding the construction of the BF Sisk Safety of Dam Modifications Project. The project is located in Merced County, CA. Major project features include: raising the existing embankments twelve feet; foundation excavation including dewatering efforts; constructing shear key and downstream stability berms; blasting and excavating approximately 21 million cubic yards from onsite borrow areas; processing excavated material for use as filter, drain, riprap, bedding, rockfill, and miscellaneous fill for completion of a zoned embankment dam; modifications to the concrete spillway; removing and replacing existing toe drain pipe. Work will be scheduled so reservoir restrictions will not be required. However, the Dam and outlet works will remain functional for normal operations during construction. The estimated duration for all phases of construction is estimated to be 8 years.  The current plan is to complete the project in 4 distinct contracts.  The estimated cost of each contract is $250,000,000.00 to $500,000,000.00

The Government will provide draft drawings for informational purposes upon request prior to the industry dam.

Industry Day Details:
Reclamation announces an Industry Day for any entity or entities interested in constructing the BF Sisk SOD Modifications. Industry Day will be held in Los Banos, CA on May 24, 2019.

Map for location and directions from Interstate 5 will be provided upon registering for the industry day.

<CONTACT>David Marks, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-628-1407, Email David.Marks@noaa.gov
<DESC><div>See attached RFI for full details</div>
<div><br /></div>
2.	Request for Information (RFI) Regarding SWFO-L1 MOC<br />NOAA will use responses to this RFI to inform programmatic planning. Responses to this RFI are not intended to be burdensome, rather this is a request for concepts for cost effective, efficient ground receiving systems. The Government is seeking information only, with no obligation to reimburse any costs associated with the preparation and/or submission of a response.<br />2.1.	Areas of Interest<br />The primary area of interest for this RFI are options to develop, deploy, and operate NOAA's SWFO-L1 MOC, including mission planning, spacecraft and instrument commanding, maintaining state of health and trending, orbit ranging and station keeping, data acquisition, and data dissemination. NOAA is interested in solutions which will support the immediate requirements of the SWFO-L1 mission but also may provide the architecture, expandability and functionality for future NOAA missions. The ideal solution would support SWFO-L1 upon delivery and be capable (with additional investment) of supporting future NOAA requirements. Elements to consider include:<br />A.	How does the proposed solution architecture support the addition of future missions? <br />B.	How does the proposed solution integrate with the greater NOAA ground enterprise?<br />C.	What support does the proposed solution provide for standards or industry supported interfaces, protocols, and automation/test scripting<br />D.	How can the proposed solution take advantage of cloud computing and other new ground system technologies?<br />E.	What elements (if any) of the proposed solution (e.g., attitude control, ground station handoffs) are not available "out of the box" in the proposed solution? What is the effort required to add the required functionality?<br />F.	What elements (if any) (e.g. flight dynamics) would NOAA need to provide to support the proposed solution?<br />G.	If the proposed solution is to integrate SWFO-L1 services into an existing baseline, discuss what effort is required to add these services to the existing baseline and/or leverage existing capabilities?<br />H.	How does the solution approach to security support a FISMA compliant SCADA system? <br />I.	What are the respondent's recommended best practices for interface with a spacecraft vendor with respect to deployment of the proposed solution to maintain cost and schedule and to minimize technical risk? Such recommendations may include recommended schedule constraints and deliverable requirements for both ground systems vendor and spacecraft vendor.<br />J.	The response may also include a discussion why the proposed solution reduces the risk, cost or schedule compared with the alternate option of using a MOC delivered by the spacecraft vendor.<br />2.2.	SWFO Performance Baseline<br />To address SWFO-L1 MOC support, respondents should assume the following program characteristics:<br />A.	MOC functions required for SWFO support include:<br />a.	Flight Operations Functions:<br />i.	Flight Situational Awareness Monitoring and Reporting,<br />ii.	 Observatory Management,<br />iii.	Spacecraft and Instrument Commanding,<br />iv.	Real-Time Telemetry Operations,<br />v.	Flight System Operations and Engineering Support,<br />vi.	Flight Dynamics and Navigation,<br />vii.	Flight Vehicle Anomaly Activities,<br />viii.	Trending and Calibration,<br />ix.	Flight Vehicle Simulation ( support spacecraft vendor's simulator), and<br />x.	Flight Software and database management<br />b.	Ground Operations Functions<br />i.	Ground Situational Awareness Monitoring and Reporting, <br />ii.	Ground Resource Allocation, <br />iii.	Antenna Operations, <br />iv.	Ground Anomaly Execution, <br />v.	Performance Monitoring and Reporting, <br />vi.	Ground System Operations and Engineering Support,<br />vii.	Ground System Simulation, and<br />viii.	Training Support<br />B.	The average telemetry data rate will be approximately 30 to 40 kbps with a goal of a variable downlink data rate that would accommodate possible periodic stored data downlinks (100 kbps or greater). The command link will be approximately 2 kbps.<br />C.	Communications will conform to CCSDS standards. NOAA will provide directly, through partners, or through commercial fee for service, standards compliant command, telemetry, and spacecraft ranging equipment at the various ground stations. Respondent should disclose if their solution relies on unique or proprietary ground station hardware or software standards.<br />D.	SWFO will use several remote ground stations and hand off communications between stations to maintain 24x7 contact with the spacecraft. The ground system shall be able to dynamically add and remove ground stations.<br />E.	Transmission from spacecraft to receipt at NOAA and MOC shall be in real-time.
<p>F.	Given the SWFO LRD of October 1, 2024, the MOC should be successfully fielded by end of 2023 to support mission readiness activities.<br />3.	Cost Estimation<br />Although firm cost estimates are not specifically requested by this RFI, a rough order of magnitude (ROM) approximation is strongly encouraged; deployment schedule to support SWFO-L1 mission milestones is paramount, but a cost-efficient approach is important.</p>

<DESC>The objective of this work is to provide technical assistance to NRC staff in developing the technical basis for integrating risk insights into the regulatory framework for I&amp;C systems and components.
<p>This project will be divided in two stages to develop the technical basis for integrating risk insights into the regulatory framework for I&amp;C systems and components. The first stage includes three major tasks: (1) assess the technical feasibility of risk-informed approaches and integrating risk insights into the regulatory review framework for I&amp;C systems and components; (2) establish a risk-informed process that can be used to classify digital I&amp;C systems and components with respect to risk insights and safety significance and to focus licensee and NRC resources on those I&amp;C systems and components identified as being important to safety, taking into consideration the unique aspects of digital I&amp;C systems (e.g., increased complexity, increased connectivity, different system architectures, combining of functions); and (3) establish potential methods and analytical tools for estimating failure frequencies of digital I&amp;C systems and assessing and addressing uncertainties in these estimates. The second stage includes one major task, which is to develop recommendations for integrating risk insights into the digital I&amp;C regulatory infrastructure, including license review approaches and inspection focus, in a manner that complements the NRC's deterministic approach and supports the NRC's traditional defense-in-depth philosophy. This will minimize regulatory uncertainty associated with the review of I&amp;C upgrades for both operating reactors and new applications for future non-LWR designs.<br /><br />The government reserves the right to make multiple awards from this solicitation.</p>

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Launch Enterprise Systems Directorate (LE), Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA is releasing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 Launch Service Procurement (LSP).  The RFP is included as an attachment to this announcement.  The solicitation implements the strategy to ensure delivery of national security satellites to the desired orbit, on schedule, and with high reliability.  The approach will address the following priorities: achieve assured access to space (AATS), maintain mission success, transition off non-allied propulsion systems (e.g., Russian built RD-180 engine), improve program affordability, foster long-term domestic competitive environment, mitigate satellite integration costs and redesign impacts, and budget for and procure launch services on time.  SMC will award two requirements contracts for launch services delivering multiple National Security Space (NSS) missions with annual ordering periods from Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 through FY 2024.

The purpose of this two-step approach is to facilitate pre-screening by the U.S. Government such that detailed proposals are only sought from applicants whose concept papers demonstrate the most promise for award (this also helps to reduce unnecessary bid and proposal effort). The government's decision to invite a Proposal will be based upon the evaluation results of a timely and compliant Concept Paper submission. Only the most highly rated Concept Papers will receive an invitation from the government to submit a Proposal. <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">An Applicant that does NOT submit a timely and compliant Concept Paper, is NOT eligible to submit a Proposal for consideration for funding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An Applicant that does NOT receive an invitation from the Government to submit a Proposal is NOT eligible to submit a Proposal.</strong> An Applicant invited to submit a Proposal will receive feedback on their Concept Paper that is expected to improve their Proposal submissions. <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">To facilitate organizations who might want to come together to submit one proposal, all proposers invited for full proposal will receive each others' contact details and concept papers (sans budget section).<br /><br /></strong>Program Overview<br />The U.S. Army Research Office (ARO) in partnership with the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) seeks research and development of technology and techniques for detection of Trojans in Artificial Intelligence. TrojAI is envisioned to be a 2-year effort with multiple awardees coming together as a group of performers (hereinafter referred to as the "performer team"), which will work together to achieve the common program goals set forth in this BAA.<br /><br />Using current machine learning methods, an artificial intelligence (AI) is trained on data, learns relationships in that data, and then is deployed to the world to operate on new data. For example, an AI can be trained on images of traffic signs, learn what stop signs and speed limit signs look like, and then be deployed as part of an autonomous car. The problem is that an adversary that can disrupt the training pipeline can insert Trojan behaviors into the AI. For example, an AI learning to distinguish traffic signs can be given potentially just a few additional examples of stop signs with yellow squares on them, each labeled "speed limit sign". If the AI were deployed in a self-driving car, an adversary could cause the car to run through the stop sign just by putting a sticky note on it, since the AI would incorrectly see it as a speed limit sign. The goal of the TrojAI Program is to combat such Trojan attacks by inspecting AIs for Trojans.<br /><br />The performer team will develop and deliver software to automatically inspect an AI and predict if it has a Trojan. The AIs will be neural networks trained in a classification task. Initially, the AIs will classify small images, but later stages of the program may expand to AIs that classify audio or text or perform other tasks. The AIs will classify input data into a small number of classes at near-human or super-human performance. As a reference, the image classification tasks will be analogous to the German Traffic Sign Recognition, but performers should not assume that the input data or classes correspond to any public data sets. Trojan attacks will modify a portion of the AIs to recognize input triggers and cause misclassification, similar to the "speed limit sign" example above. The performer team will deliver software that detects which AIs have been subject to a Trojan attack. Performer software will take as input the AI's source code, architecture and compiled binary. The performer software may also receive a small number of examples of valid data from the AI's problem domain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The performer team should be prepared to initially develop methods for AIs made of feedforward networks (e.g. Convolutional Neural Nets like ResNet for image classification) and then later develop methods for AIs made of recurrent networks (e.g. Long-Short Term Memory Networks for audio or text classification).</p>

Light Weight Segmented Ladder x 12" Wide 5 Section
;The Lightweight Tactical Ladder System is a segmented carbon fiber ladder platform developed to fill the need for an extremely strong, light and portable ladder. These patent-pending tactical ladders provide a substanstial improvement over conventional ladders for applications where weight and compact size are critical. The high stiffness and strength of carbon fiber provide a superior self supporting ladder that can support a military or tactical law enforcement person and weighs only 12 pounds when fully assembled. Each segment weighs only 2.4 pounds and quickly and quietly slide together to form a ladder that goes from just over 4 feet up to a full 5 segment ladder of 12 feet high.

The lightweight segmented ladders can be used by a group of individuals that may need a short 4-foot, or up to a 12 foot tall ladder, but who are traveling on foot and cannot bring a regular ladder in a vehicle. For law enforcement, the compact segments can be stored in a bag in the trunk of the car and only utilized when  necessary. This allows SWAT teams and other officers to have a ladder available at any time in under a  minute, but without the bulk or weight of conventional metal ladders.
The lightweight ladder minimizes load on soldier.
Basic set comes with 5 segments, each weighing under 2.5 pounds.
When combined, the segments form a 12 feet long ladder weighing 12 pounds.
Assembled segments measure 29 long (21.75 for LSL-6) with multiple widths available.
Assembles and disassembles quickly and quietly.
Ability to break the ladder into smaller sections makes storage and transport easy.
Textured rungs for improved grip.

Feature Highlights: 
Extremely lightweight: Easily carried, rapid deployment, allows placement in difficult situations
Small individual segments: Easy portability and storage, for example the trunk of a car or backpack
Quick, easy and quiet assembly
Segmented  Only take as much ladder as needed for the mission

Additional uses of ladder segments:
Stretcher
Table
Door wedge

The wide segment carbon fiber ladder is an all-purpose lightweight tool for scaling walls and other vertical obstacles. At only 2.4 pounds per segment, it is extremely light, yet offers ample room to place both feet side-by-side on a single rung. This design was developed in response to customer demand for this capability.

The TBS CROSSFIRE is a long range R/C link based on the newest RF technology, capable of self-healing two-way communications and range beyond comprehension. With a sensitivity of -130dB, full RF-side diveristy rather than just antenna-diversity, the features already implemented and the future upgrades to come make the TBS CROSSFIRE the only long range control link worthy of our times.

Remote control links, however, are tasked with much more than range. Telemetry, robustness against interference, connectivity with smart devices, ease of use and the overall finish are often overlooked to achieve the last bit of range. The end result is often strange behavior, lack of reliability, or simply things that were never envisioned and thus not possible. Let's kiss those days goodbye, and move on to a brighter future :)

Through the OLED Display on the transmitter, you can monitor the real-time location of your drone (TBS GPS or BlackBox with DJI Naza or APM-based GPS required).  The up- and downlink status provide a feeling of safety, the configuration options through the OLED display do away with any PC-based configuration tools. The pulsing LED relays your link budget and link health in colorized form (green = keep going, orange = turn around). In case of a crash, the location of the drone is visible on the OLED as well. The built in battery on the receiver turns it into a beacon automatically - and it will continue to transmit its last known location until the battery runs out., 28, EA;<BR><span class="label">LI 007: </span>AViPAS  AV-1071 HDMI PTZ Camera

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<DESC>The current Solicitation 6FEC-E6-030292-B, Refresh 36, dated May 3, 2019 is hereby issued to incorporate multiple clause and regulation updates, and other administrative changes. Offers received after the current refresh date May 3, 2019, using any templates or attachments from previous refresh solicitations will be rejected.

This solicitation is open continuously with no closing date. The resultant contracts are awarded as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity; Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment. Contract periods commence on the Date of Award through a 5-year base period with three 5-year option periods. The resultant contracts provide a streamlined acquisition approach for federal agencies to obtain services related to facilities maintenance and management solutions for real property and energy management, water conservation and support services.  Agency ordering procedures for services and further information on the GSA Multiple Award Schedules program may be found at www.gsa.gov/schedules.   

As part of GSAs continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 

Full Products and Broad Services Offerings
Offeror must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). 

Fair and Reasonable Pricing
To determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.   

PLEASE NOTE:  ALL RESPONSES SHALL BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY AS EOFFERS 

The following link provides guidance on utilizing the eOffer and eMod systems, obtaining digital certificates, and using the eOffer and eMod Training Guides:  http://eoffer.gsa.gov.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing Solicitation Number 
QMAD-CY-090001-B, Refresh #25 for Multiple Award Schedule 599 Travel Services Solutions, effective 05/03/2019 replacing former Solicitation Number QMAD-CY-090001-B Refresh 24.

SCA WAGE DETERMINATIONS

The Service Contract Act (Service Contract Labor Standards) wage determinations have been updated. There are no clause or policy changes related to the application of SCA/SCLS at this time. Price adjustments should be submitted within 30 days of signing this modification and made in accordance with FAR clause 52.222-43 and either clause I-FSS-969 or clause 552.216-70. (depending on which clause is incorporated in the contract) 

REQUIRED ORDER STATUS FOR GSA ADVANTAGE! PRODUCT ORDERS

GSA is committed to improving the customer experience and strives to ensure that government buying and selling is easy, efficient, and modern. Our annual Customer Loyalty Survey indicates a need to provide more information on order status and shipping. Providing prompt status updates keeps customers informed, increases customer satisfaction, and reduces calls and email inquiries.

Providing order status on GSA Advantage! orders will be mandatory upon acceptance of this modification with 100% compliance expected by October 31, 2019. Contractors must use Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), cXML or the GSA Advantage Purchase Order (PO) Portal to provide order acknowledgment information that enables ordering agencies to track the location of an order at any time, from the moment the order is shipped, to the point of delivery and acceptance.  

The GSA Advantage Purchase Order (PO) Portal, which is accessible at https://www.poportal.gsa.gov/poportal/welcome.do gives GSA schedule contractors quick and easy access to purchase orders placed by federal agencies using GSA Advantage or eBuy. The PO Portal allows contractors to view, print and/or download orders and to send order acknowledgment/status directly to ordering agencies. 

When a Customer places an order, contractors will receive a system-generated notice inviting the contractor to register for the PO Portal.  A notice to register will only be sent to the contractor once an order is received by GSA. For more information on the PO portal, review the help guide at: https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/images/products/elib/pdf_files/pohp.pdf. 

For questions or problems with an order or the PO Portal website, contractors may reach out to the Vendor Support Center (VSC) Help Desk at vendor.support@gsa.gov or call the VSC at 1-877-495-4849. If the VSC is unable to resolve an issue, contractors can email AdvantageOrderStatus@gsa.gov for assistance. 

Contractors and ordering agencies can also use EDI for order placement, order changes, and order status. Contractors currently using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or cXML for Advantage orders, must provide order status using that method. EDI and cXML instructions can be found at the Vendor Support Center (VSC) site: https://vsc.gsa.gov/. For assistance with EDI or cXML orders, contractors may contact the EDI Helpdesk at 703-605-9444 or email edistat@gsa.gov.

SECTION 508 STANDARDS

The proposal instructions in provision SCP-FSS-001 have been updated to require offerors proposing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) products or services to identify whether the proposed products or services are in compliance with Section 508 accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194, and to identify where full details of compliance can be found (e.g., vendors website or other exact location.)

The updated instructions apply to modification requests to add Information and Communication Technology (ICT) products or services to your Schedule contract.

Please be advised that MAS contracts may include noncompliant Information and Communication Technology (ICT), however, requiring and ordering activities must ensure ICT supplies or services meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36 CFR Part1194, unless the Government determines an exception applies at the time a task or delivery order is issued. 

ABILITYONE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME ITEMS

The proposal instructions in provision SCP-FSS-001 have been updated to clarify that an offeror who is not an authorized AbilityOne distributor must remove commercial products that are considered essentially the same (ETS) as AbilityOne products from its FSS proposal. This requirement applies to all FSS proposals regardless of Schedule or Special Item Number (SIN).

The updated instructions apply to modification requests to add products to your Schedule contract.

Please be advised that GSA conducts periodic reviews of electronic catalogs on GSA Advantage to identify any items that are essentially the same as mandatory AbilityOne procurement list items. GSA then notifies the Schedule contractor of the ETS determination, and after a challenge period concludes, unilaterally removes the items from GSA Advantage and issues contract modifications to remove the items from the Schedule contract.

FAR CLAUSE 52.222-50 COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS

This clause has been updated to include a comprehensive definition of recruitment fees. Please refer to FAC 2019-01, FAR Case 2015-017 for more information

52.209-5 Representation by Corporations Regarding an Unpaid Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law(Deviation) (March 2012) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are   are not   presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have   have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks  have , the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); 
(C) Are   are not   presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
(D) Have  , have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. During the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has o has not o , within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2)  Principal,  for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

Also the standards and recommendations of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) or the Accreditation Organization must be adhered to. The Contract Physician(s) shall be required to participate in a quality improvement program, which is consistent with current requirements for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the quality and appropriateness of care.</p>

Health information must include previous immunization history and proof of the following immunization records: Hepatitis B (Vaccination-declination required), Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR), Varicella, Influenza, and Tuberculosis.</p>
<p><strong>Security Clearance:<br /></strong>Performance of this contract :will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the IHS (Indian Health Service). Before starting work requiring routine access to IHS facilities or systems each person must complete an FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an IHS employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for IHS processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an IHS site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of IHS sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The IHS utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the eQIP entry to the OPM (Office of Personnel Management) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the Service Unit for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>OIG Exclusion List:<br /></strong>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations, the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin by DoDAAC" and "Issue by DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS (DEC 2017)</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer.</p>
<p>Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico (replaces RapidGate). Vendor is responsible to acquire DBIDS credentials prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at https://www.cnic.navy.mil/om/dbids.html. DBIDS credentials require (in succession) (1) Present a letter or official document from the Government sponsoring organization that provides the purpose for your access, (2) Present valid identification, such as a passport or Real ID Act-compliant state driver's license, (3) Present a completed copy of the SECNAV 5512/1 form to obtain your background check, (4) Upon completion of the background check, the Visitor Control Center representative will complete the DBIDS enrollment process, which includes your photo, finger prints, base restrictions, and several other assessments, and (5) After all of this is done, the contractor will be provided with the DBDIS credential. For vendors with existing Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS) cards, see https://www.cnic.navy.mil/om/dbids.html for instructions to obtain DBIDS credentials. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held DBIDS credentials are active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with DBIDS. Additional access permissions may be required in the future. <br /><br />(End of Text)</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii)	The solicitation number is 75N95019Q00118 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold at $250,000.00.</p>
<p>THIS IS A NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) COMBINED SYNOPSIS SOLICITATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisition (OA), on behalf of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name) for a Brand-Name-Only requirement of items manufactured by Fluidigm Corporation located at 7000 Shoreline Court, South San Francisco, CA 94080.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted as non-competitive for a commercial item or service and is conducted pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>(iii)	The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) Number 2019-01, with effective date January 22, 2019.</p>
<p>(iv)	The associated NAICS code is 334516-Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with associated small business size standard of 1000 employees. This requirement is solicited on a Total Small Business Set-Aside basis.</p>
<p>(v)	This requirement is for the following general requirements: to obtain five (5) "96.96 Dynamic Array<sup>TM</sup> IFCs for Gene Expression and sufficient Control Line Fluid syringes and reagents. - 10 IFCs" and ten (10) "Preamp and Reverse Transcription Master Mix", which allow SCTL scientists to examine gene expression profiles at a single cell level and continue ongoing projects on defining stem cell differentiation process in a heterogeneous population. These chip kits and reagent kits must meet certain salient characterisitcs that is required to achieve SCTL project milestones, specifically to be compatibile with the existing Fluidigm Juno and Biomaker HD systems to set up and conduct 9216 qPCR reactions in parallel at a time.</p>
<p>The following features are deemed essential that this requirement shall achieve and must be compatible with the Fluidigm Juno and Biomaker HD systems.</p>
<p>1.	The Fluidigm 96.96 Dynamic Array IFCs for Gene Expression and sufficient Control Line syringes and reagents - 10 IFCs contains: Ten 96.96 Dynamics Array IFCs and sufficient Control Line Fluid syringes and reagents needed to prepapre the IFCs.</p>
<p>2.	The Preamp and Reverse Transcriptopm Master Mix - 5 Tubes contains: 5 tubes of preamp and reverse transcription master mix enough to complete 480 reactions.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Offeror shall quote the following Item Number; Product Name; Quantity, manufactured by Fluidigm Corporation:</p>
<p>1.	BMK-M10-96.96; 96.96 Sample/Loading Kit-10 IFCs; FIVE (5).<br />2.	100-6301; Preamp and Reverse Transcription Master Mix-5 Tubes; TEN (10).</p>
<p>(vi)	BACKGROUND: The goal of this procurement is to establish and move stem cell technologies forward through a more centralized effort. The NIH Sem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL) within NCATS has a goal to bring iPSC technology closer to clinical application, drug discovery and regenerative medicine. Through the SCTL, NCATS will provide researchers across various disciplines and organizations with the ability to establish collaborations to advance the translation of regenerative medicine applications. SCTL projects on defining stem cell differentiation process in a heterogeneous population require examing gene expression profiles at a single cell level. Currently existing direct differentiation protocols for in-vitro stem cell differentiation produce heterogeneous cell population. Conventional bulk methods of qPCR process thousands of cells at a time and average out the difference. SCTL aims to understand the molecular mechanisms induced by individual compounds using in-vitro differentiation so that the team can precisely control the differentiation process. To achieve this goal, SCTL will focus on characterizing gene expression heterogeneity for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells at a pluripotent state under defined culture condition at a single cell level and systematically characterize cell transcriptome changes for those cells induced by small molecules which exit from pluripotency and undergo lineage commitment.</p>
<p>INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE<br />Offerors should indicate an estimated delivery time in full after receipt of an order including if training or warranty provisions are applicable. Inspection and acceptance will be performed at NCATS, located at 9800 Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD 20850. <br />(vii)	The provision at FAR 52.252-1, Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference (Feb 1998), applies to this acquisition.

<p>(viii)	The provision at FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Responses received to this RFQ will be evaluated on a Trade-Off basis. The award will be made on a competitive best value basis, using "tradeoff" among price-cost and non-price-cost factors.  The Government may elect to award to other than the lowest priced offeror, or other than the offeror with the highest rated non-price-cost proposal.  In either case, a tradeoff will be conducted.  The government reserves such right of flexibility in conducting the evaluation as necessary to assure an award with the contractor providing the best value to the government. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award, cost or price is also important to the overall award decision.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  However, cost or price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event two or more offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price.</p>
<p>Quotations will be evaluated based on the factor of Technical Capability: Offerors shall clearly indicate possessing the technical capability to achieve the essential salient characteristic features of this requirement. The Offeror must indicate in its quotation the ability to provide all of the requirements. The Offeror must indicate in its quotation the ability to meet the delivery requirements and evidence of possessing the technical knowledge, qualifications and capability and management structure needed in successfully achieving this requirement. Quotations will be evaluated using adjective ratings and no numeric point system will be used. Excellent (Risk level: Very low); Good (Risk level: Low); Acceptable (Risk Level: Neutral); Marginal (Risk level: High); Unacceptable (Risk level: Very high).</p>
<p>Cost: The Offeror(s) cost/price quotation will be evaluated for reasonableness and best value to the government. Basic cost and price information in the Offerors' quote must contain sufficient information to allow the Government to perform a basic analysis of the reasonableness of the Offeror to supply the required services and/or supply. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. The Government intends to make an award(s) to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. Discounts may be taken into account for this selection criterion, however the government reserves the right to make a selection decision with tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Respondents that believe that they are manufacturers or authorized resellers of any BRAND-NAME product specified in this announcement must provide, as part of their response: (a) product, catalog, model, and/or part number(s); (b) product description; (c) all relevant information and documentation that the item(s) offered meets the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics as specified in the purchase description; quantity; estimated price or cost; shipping, handling, and/or installation charges; and delivery date after receipt of order.<br />A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(ix)	The Offerors to include a completed copy of the provision at FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.</p>
<p>(x)	The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Oct 2018), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xi)	The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>(xii)	The following additional contract requirement(s) or terms and conditions as determined by the contracting officer are necessary for this acquisition and consistent with customary commercial practices. <br />There are no additional contract requirement(s) or terms and conditions applicable to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xiii)	The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) are not applicable to this requirement.</p>
<p>(xiv)	Responses to this solicitation must include clear and convincing evidence of the offeror's capability of fulfilling the requirement as it relates to the technical evaluation criteria. The price proposal must include a Fixed-price quote including unit pricing, quantity, and total price proposed and all other relevant information and documentation that the item(s) quoted meets the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics as specified in this solicitation.</p>
<p>The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size must be included in the response. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Past performance information of key personnel may be provided if the company has limited or no past performance. In the case of an contractor with only one or without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the quote will be evaluated as "Acceptable" on Past Performance, providing the Contractor supplies a certified statement with their quote that no past performance information is available.

The Government's approach will be to check the references provided by the contractor to verify satisfactory past performance. In addition to the above, the<br /> Government may review any other sources, as well as data obtained from other sources available, i.e. government database, past contract files, etc. The offeror is cautioned that while the Government will consider data from other sources, the burden of demonstrating acceptable past performance rests with the offeror.</span></p>

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Colonel Traci Kuekermurphy, HQ AFRC/DSD, 255 Richard Ray Blvd, Robins AFB GA 31098.

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>5352.242-9000 CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS (Nov 2012) <br />(a) The contractor shall obtain base identification and vehicle passes, if required, for all contractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation. <br />(b) The contractor shall submit a written request on company letterhead to the contracting officer listing the following: contract number, location of work site, start and stop dates, full legal name (Last, First, Middle), driver's license number and state of residence (If no DL then state ID, if no state ID, then date of birth), of all employees and subcontractor employees requesting access to the installation. They will submit to a background check or be denied entry. If unfavorable information is discovered, entry may be denied (AFMAN 31-113, paragraph 4.13.1). The letter will also specify the individual(s) authorized to sign for a request for base identification credentials or vehicle passes. The contracting officer will endorse the request and forward it to the issuing base pass and registration office or security police for processing. When reporting to the registration office (Security Forces Pass &amp; ID, Bldg. 906), the authorized contractor individual(s) must conform to the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. All persons requesting access must provide a REAL ID Act compliant credential (AFMAN 31-113, paragraph 3.1.) <br />2. All persons and their property are subject to inspection, IAW Internal Security Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 797, Sec.21) and the Code of Federal Regulation Title 32 Sec 809a.2. <br />3. Contractors are not authorized escort authority. (AFMAN 31-113, paragraph 6.5.2.) The organization requesting the project will provide escorts. <br />4. Dangerous weapons or destructive devices are not allowed. Firearm permits and conceal/carry permits are not exempt. (IDP, Annex C, Appendix 1, Tab L, paragraph 4.9.) The majority of this installation is federal exclusive jurisdiction which overrides state, county or local weapons permits. <br />5. Driving a vehicle on military installations is a privilege granted by the installation commander (AFI 31-218 Chap 2). All operators must be able to produce, on request, proof of insurance and a valid driver's license.</p>
<p>(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site. The general contractor will provide the full names and driver's license numbers of all contract personnel and subcontractor personnel to Base Contracting who will in turn provide to Security Forces to be used in a criminal background check.<br />(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with any other security measures imposed. <br />(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office. <br />(f) Failure to comply with any of these requiresmens may result in withholding of final payment.</p>
<p>Notice of REAL ID Act Implications<br />NOTICE: REAL ID Act enforcement by the Department of Defense was implemented. As such, non-enhanced MN driver's licenses and state identification cards will soon become invalid for access to the Minneapolis-St. Paul Air Reserve Station/934th Airlift Wing. Therefore, contractors, subcontractors, and delivery drivers will be required to possess an Enhanced Driver's License/State ID Card, or U.S. Passport for continued access to the installation. Lead time to obtain these accepted forms of identification is approximately 6 weeks. Notice of REAL ID enforcement on this installation will be provided as soon as is possible; however, it is likely that notice could be insufficient to obtain an enhanced ID.</p>
<p>UPDATE 31JAN19: NO STATES ARE SUBJECT TO REAL ID ENFORCEMENT AT THIS TIME. DoD will accept standard State-issued driver's licenses and identification cards from all U.S. States and territories as proof of identity. However, please note a key exception: State-issued driver's licenses and identification cards marked "Not Valid for Federal Purposes", "Federal Limits May Apply" or other similar language still may not be accepted by DoD. Currently Minnesota is issuing ID's marked "Not Valid for Federal Purposes" unless the person requests a REAL ID compliant ID</p>

<DESC><div>The purpose of this modification is to post the below questions and responses.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Question</strong>: In the RFP it notes "fully ADA accessible hotel rooms and conference area" - Can you tell me how many ADA accessible rooms are needed out of the 130? <br /><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>Response</strong>: We do not anticipate needing more than 2 sleeping rooms that can accommodate a wheelchair, if any at all. (In the past we have not needed any. Since we are the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped we should be able to accommodate a physically handicapped attendee if needed.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In terms of the conference area - we want to be sure that a ramp to the presentation stage is available if needed---in case a guest speaker is in a wheelchair.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Question</strong>: Evening reception - What is the expected attendance for this event?<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Response</strong>: We will not know the exact attendance until the registration closes 30 days before the conference.  In the past we have had 130-200 attendees at the evening reception</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Questions</strong>: Rental computers - the RFP it states getting a quote for Intel Core Computers, between 60 and 160 machines. Is there a more specific number of work stations they will need? Does anyone bring their own computers?<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Response</strong>: The Intel Core Computers may be needed for training purposes--- like you would see in a computer training lab/ class.  This is in the RFP because we may need to provide laptops with specific software installed on them for attendees to access certain programs.  We will know the specific number of laptops needed when we get closer to the conference dates and the agenda and training schedule is set and the registration is complete.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Question</strong>: Decision date - Do you know when the group plans to make a decision on a host?</div>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>Response</strong>: We anticipate to make an award mid-June</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Also, all proposals must also include Oral Presentation availability as described in Section L and M of the solicitation.</strong></span></div>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Light Weight Segmented Ladder x 12" Wide 5 Section
;The Lightweight Tactical Ladder System is a segmented carbon fiber ladder platform developed to fill the need for an extremely strong, light and portable ladder. These patent-pending tactical ladders provide a substanstial improvement over conventional ladders for applications where weight and compact size are critical. The high stiffness and strength of carbon fiber provide a superior self supporting ladder that can support a military or tactical law enforcement person and weighs only 12 pounds when fully assembled. Each segment weighs only 2.4 pounds and quickly and quietly slide together to form a ladder that goes from just over 4 feet up to a full 5 segment ladder of 12 feet high.

The lightweight segmented ladders can be used by a group of individuals that may need a short 4-foot, or up to a 12 foot tall ladder, but who are traveling on foot and cannot bring a regular ladder in a vehicle. For law enforcement, the compact segments can be stored in a bag in the trunk of the car and only utilized when  necessary. This allows SWAT teams and other officers to have a ladder available at any time in under a  minute, but without the bulk or weight of conventional metal ladders.
The lightweight ladder minimizes load on soldier.
Basic set comes with 5 segments, each weighing under 2.5 pounds.
When combined, the segments form a 12 feet long ladder weighing 12 pounds.
Assembled segments measure 29 long (21.75 for LSL-6) with multiple widths available.
Assembles and disassembles quickly and quietly.
Ability to break the ladder into smaller sections makes storage and transport easy.
Textured rungs for improved grip.

Feature Highlights: 
Extremely lightweight: Easily carried, rapid deployment, allows placement in difficult situations
Small individual segments: Easy portability and storage, for example the trunk of a car or backpack
Quick, easy and quiet assembly
Segmented  Only take as much ladder as needed for the mission

Additional uses of ladder segments:
Stretcher
Table
Door wedge

The wide segment carbon fiber ladder is an all-purpose lightweight tool for scaling walls and other vertical obstacles. At only 2.4 pounds per segment, it is extremely light, yet offers ample room to place both feet side-by-side on a single rung. This design was developed in response to customer demand for this capability.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This Enterprise contract will accept additional aircraft maintenance customers from any Major Command (MAJCOM) at any AF location within the Contiguous United States (CONUS), Alaska, and Hawaii throughout the period of performance (PoP); therefore, additional aircraft maintenance scope may be available in the future.

The PoP will have a 10 year ordering period and up to an additional 5 years for performance after the last order is placed for a total possible period performance of 15 years.

This is a new requirement and will extend to existing portal services across multiple nodes as the US Army North deploys the Mission Network.  Requirement is for a software package capable of providing replication, governance, administration, data security/compliance, migration, storage and archiving, reporting, backup and restoration of up to 12 SharePoint farms as well as a development SharePoint Farm on premise and in the cloud. This is not a requirement for portal software, the government already has sufficient portal software. Anticipated period of performance is one base year, with four option years.&nbsp;</div>

Response: The information requested is to survey the marketplace to understand the capabilities and capacity of various types of small businesses to perform the effort. In particular, if the firm is able to provide the primary and vital work under this requirement. Firms may discuss their approach to acquire additional outside resources; however, we do request that the firm demonstrate that their approach will maintain their size status if such an arrangement was proposed.  


SUBMISSION OPTION:
Firms may also submit their capability statements via email to:  Ryan.Miller@hq.doe.gov and ann.miller@hq.doe.gov 

The DOE National Training Center (NTC) is performing market research on small businesses that can provide for facilities operations, professional training, technical information technology, and management support. The NTC is a reporting element of the Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Enterprise Assessments (EA) in Washington, D.C. NTC facilities consist of classrooms, administrative offices, and weapons firing ranges. The Main Campus is located on Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB), Albuquerque, NM. The Live Fire Range (LFR) and the Integrated Safety and Security Training Evaluation Complex (ISSTEC), a simulated DOE research and operational facility, are located approximately six miles east of the Main Campus.

The NTC training programs support the federal and contractor safety and security professionals who support DOE missions. Safeguards and Security (S&S) training programs include vulnerability assessments, nuclear materials control and accountability, physical security systems, personnel security, information security, and security program operations. The Protective Force component of the S&S training programs include specialized training in weapons maintenance and firing, and response force tactics. The safety training program is designed to support DOE personnel who perform federal assurance and specific federal duties within the DOE technical qualification program. The safety training program includes technical leadership, nuclear facility safety basis, safety management programs, and oversight.

Operational excellence and an open, collaborative work environment are underlying tenants for the operation of the NTC. The Contractor shall foster the development, support and sustained implementation of a work environment that promotes trust, a questioning attitude, and a willingness to raise issues. These operating tenants also require compliance with regulations and standards while performing the NTC training missions on time, at a reasonable cost in a safe and secure manner. Therefore, implementation of a disciplined, effective and efficient Management Assurance System is a significant objective of this requirement.

As a precursor to the competitive process to acquire these services, the DOE/NTC is conducting market research to determine the markets capability to satisfy the draft Performance Work Statement (dPWS) (Attachment 1) and Draft Position Qualification (dPQ)(Attachment 2) requirements. The NTC intends to gather market research from responders who have proven experience performing the activities described herein. Specifically, DOE NTC is seeking to measure the capacity and capability of Small Businesses to perform these services under the anticipated NAICS codes of 611519 (Other Technical and Trade Schools, Size Standard $15M) or 611430 (Professional and Management Development Training, size standard $11M).  DOE/NTC has yet determined the most appropriate NAICS code for this acquisition and is requesting feedback from industry. Interested parties should review the dPWS and dPQ for the specific requirements.

This Sources Sought Notice affords interested parties an avenue to provide feedback for this requirement via Capability Statements. This is optional, and participation will not affect a partys ability to provide a proposal if a solicitation does result from this requirement. There is no solicitation at this time. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  

Capability Statements:

Interested parties are requested to provide capability statements that specifically address the capacity and capability to provide the requirements in the dPWS. The capability statements should provide the following:
	Company name, title, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail of designated point of contact.
	Small Business type and SBA socio-economic subcategories for NAICS Codes 611519 and 611430.
	8a status and graduation date. 	
	State whether or not your company has a current contract under any GSA Schedules, or Other government wide acquisition vehicles. 
	Companys corporate experience in providing similar services over the past 5 years. Describe your experience providing facilities operations; professional training development and management; cybersecurity; IT; software development and maintenance services; and associated project management necessary for the successful operation of a NTC-scaled facility. We are only seeking capabilities from the Company, please do not include capabilities from subcontractors or team members.  
	Please identify your companys core competencies and experience directly relevant to the activities of the NTC. Submit a list of comparable support services that your company provided within the last 2 years for government agencies. Include customer points of contact (POCs) for each effort, including their name, official title, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
	Identify the personnel the Company has on staff that can meet or exceed the position qualifications as described in dPQ; and identify those positions in which the Company would have to rely on a subcontract to acquire.
	Identify whether key and other designated personnel have current Department of Energy L/Q clearances or current Secret/Top Secret clearances from another federal agency or whether personnel are likely to be granted L/Q clearances. Explain their availability and capacity to offer diverse technical support services in a classified environment.
	State whether your firm is American owned or whether it has or requires a Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence clearance and an Organizational Conflict of Interest clearance with the Department of Energy or the Department of Defense.
	If your company or a team member has performed work in the past, or is performing work presently, for the Department of Energy, please list the authorizing program office, the dates of service, the contract type, a description of the work scope, and the program POC.

Interested Parties are also invited to provide feedback on the following:
	Do you believe that the dPWS and dPQ is sufficiently clear to allow for a concise proposal response and realistic roadmap/schedule to be developed to achieving these objectives? Are there sections that you feel are weak and need more/better clarifications? If so, please identify.
	What sort of contract type(s) do you feel would be most appropriate for this acquisition, please provide a rational and potential cost savings to the government. 
	Between NAICS Codes 611519 and 611430, which one do you feel is most appropriate, and why. Is there another NAICS Code that better reflects this requirement? 

Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for certain SBA socio-economic subcategories, small businesses, or procured through full and open competition. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.

The capability statement and comments on the dPWS and dPQ must be submitted via FedConnect (under 89303019NEA000006), no later than May 15, 2019 at 5:00 p.m. The capability statement shall not exceed twenty five (25) pages in length (excluding requested feedback).  Comments submitted on the dPWS and dPQ shall be submitted as a separate file.

<strong>
<div><strong><br /></strong></div>
Objective</strong>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is conducting this sources sought to identify facilities possessing the availability, services, and accommodations as specified below.</p>
<p>As permitted by FAR Part 10, this sources sought notice is a market research tool used for information and planning purposes <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>only</em></span>.  This notice shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or obligate the government to issue a solicitation.</p>
<p>The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request, therefore proposal will not be considered.&nbsp; As this is a sources sought notice for market research, the government will <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></em> entertain questions.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice's and the FTC (sponsoring agencies) will host an International Competition Network's Annual Conference in 2020 (ICN 2020).  ICN 2020 is a unique opportunity for the US Antitrust Agencies to underscore their worldwide leadership in competition policy and enforcement, and to provide a powerful example of best practices for the international antitrust community.</p>
<p>The ICN annual conferences typically attract 500 to 600 delegates (including representatives from the host agency) from 60 to 80 different countries.  The sponsoring agencies anticipate that a U.S.-located conference would draw up to at least 650 delegates, with a majority of the delegates coming from outside of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Conference Dates</strong></p>
<p>ICN annual conferences typically take place in the spring (April or May) and span approximately three days, generally beginning on a Monday or Tuesday evening and concluding on a Thursday or Friday afternoon.  The 2020 conference is to be held in any April or May week (we might consider June) except not during the American Bar Association Section of Antitrust Law Spring Meeting (April 22-24, 2020) or the OECD Competition Committee meetings (June 8-12, 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Location Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The optimal location for ICN 2020 is a major city with a large, international airport that operates as a gateway for international flights (i.e., has many direct international flights) and the FTC wants to specifically explore sites near Washington, D. C.  The DOJ requires that the location not be a resort or other vacation-like settings.</p>
<p>For the FTC's purposes, the conference site location must be east of but no further than 30 miles east of Dulles international airport or within a 15 miles radius of Reagan International Airport.  The conference site, if it is not a hotel or facility that has its own overnight accommodation infrastructure, must then be in close proximity to sufficient hotels to host all conference attendees.  The assembly of hotels near the conference must be of varying classes from high to low, so that lower cost overnighting options will be available for booking by attendees with limited resources.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Meeting Space Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Generally, ICN 2020 requires a venue consisting of  eight and up to ten rooms for smaller group breakout and side sessions with a mix of seating configurations (classroom, theater, banquet, and square/donut) and a capacity of approximately 50 to 100 delegates each (depending on the set up).  Breakout session rooms must be equipped with audiovisual equipment (e.g., at minimum a projector and a single projection screen and microphones).  The event space will need to include separate areas for lunch and space close to the meeting rooms adequate for breaks.</p>
<p>In detail, to handle the above, the conference facility must provide:</p>
<p>(a) a large meeting area for plenary meetings, seating at least 650 delegates as specified below; (b) minimum of eight to a maximum ten rooms for breakout sessions that can accommodate a variety of seating configurations, with a capacity ranging between approximately 50 and 100 delegates each; and, <br />(c) a minimum of four to a maximum of six smaller meeting rooms with capacity for at about 10 delegates each.</p>
<p>All event facilities must be handicapped accessible, in accordance with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974.</p>
<p>If there is an additional charge for rooms in excess of the quantities above, price quotes may list them as separate options.</p>
<p><strong>Plenary Room (capacity and set up)</strong></p>
<p>The main conference sessions (approximately 10 hour long days) will take place in a large plenary room that can accommodate approximately 650 delegates, with a mix of classroom style (tables with chairs) for approximately 300 to 400 delegates and theatre style (chairs) for the remainder, set up on the sides (and possibly in the back) of the room.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ancillary Elements to be in an eventual price quotation</span>:  It is required that the conference site be equipped with WiFi access to the internet included within the package price for the facility use. Availability of power outlets for attendees to recharge their electronic devices is highly desirable, and will be an evaluation factor the government will consider when evaluating competing quotes.  Cleaning services are to be provided and included in the package price quote and is to occur at each significant plenary break and included in the facility use quotation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ancillary Elements Required, but that shall be separately priced</span>:  The plenary room must have audiovisual equipment and screens to project video of the speakers and other multimedia (e.g. videos, slides), microphones (for speakers and audience Q&amp;A), an elevated stage with a podium and configured to accommodate various plenary discussion formats.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ancillary Requirements to be Separately Priced as Optional</span>:  While the single required podium is typically needed for opening and closing sessions and should be included in the room rental package price quote, keynotes speeches, awards ceremonies and similar programs will require that the venue operator be prepared to provide other furnishings.  These may potentially including armchairs for less formal discussions, speaker tables for panel discussions, and additional podiums for debate style programs.  The government will engage a contract planning firm and needs to reserve the right to have a conference planning contractor arrange for specific furniture (either government owned or furniture rented elsewhere and moved to the conference rooms) if the FTC chooses to not have the venue operating company provide such.</p>
<p>Water will be provided in breakout rooms, and cleaning services will be provided between sessions.<br /> <br /><strong>Bilateral/Multilateral Meeting Rooms</strong></p>
<p>ICN 2020 will require a minimum of four and up to six additional rooms for bilateral and multilateral meetings and for the administration of the conference, with conference tables that seat approximately 10 to 25 delegates.  If there is an additional charge for rooms in excess of four, the charge for each shall be listed as an option.  Audiovisual equipment is not needed for these rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Registration Desk</strong><br /> <br />ICN 2020 will require a space and tables for registration the evening before the conference begins and throughout the conference.  The Contractor shall set-up a registration desk the evening before the first day of the conference to allow attendees to register/check in.  The registration desk shall remain open throughout the duration of the conference.  Government employees will staff the registration desk.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodations</strong></p>
<p>The conference site should either have accommodations on site or should be located in close proximity to hotels with adequate accommodations.  Lower cost options should be available.  If the conference site has accommodations, the site should be prepared to offer a block of rooms until a time reasonably close to ICN 2020.  If it does not, a factor in selection will be whether nearby hotels will offer similar blocks of rooms.  ATR will not pay for accommodations as part of</p>
<p><strong>Submission Instructions</strong></p>
<p>Please provide responses via email no later than 12:00 PM (ET) on Friday, May 10, 2019 to acqsubmission@ftc.gov with "ICN Conference" in the email subject line.</p>
<p>Responses exceeding five pages will not be considered; all responses shall include the following:<br />1)	Availability<br />2)	Published price or internet link to pricing</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">New U.S. Land Port of Entry (LPOE) in</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Madawaska, Maine</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>
The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service, Region 1 (New&nbsp;England), is conducting market research for the design and construction of a new Land Port of&nbsp;Entry (LPOE) in Madawaska, Maine. This project is defined as a New Construction project,&nbsp;using a collaborative Design-Build-Bridging approach that follows the GSA Design Excellence&nbsp;and Operational Excellence guidelines, the GSA Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings&nbsp;Service (P-100) 2018, U.S. CBP Land Port of Entry Design Standards (P-130) 2018, and&nbsp;meets U.S. Green Building Council LEED Gold. GSA has contracted with a Design Build-&nbsp;Bridging Architect who is the Owner's Design Consultant (ODC) and who will define the&nbsp;preliminary design and performance specifications through the equivalent of the Concept&nbsp;Phase and then produce the Bridging Contract Documents that must fully protect the design&nbsp;intent, quality and project budget.<br /><br />
<div>In accordance with FAR Subpart 36.3, Two-Phase Design Build Selection Procedures, GSA&nbsp;intends to solicit to receive competitive Design Build (DB) fixed-priced proposals from a Design&nbsp;Build team who will complete the design, construction documents, and construction. GSA will&nbsp;contract directly with the general contractor who will subcontract with the Architect of Record.&nbsp;The integrated and comprehensive team will include all disciplines needed to develop the&nbsp;design submissions and the construction document package, such as architecture;&nbsp;mechanical, electrical, and plumbing system engineering; structural engineering; fire/life safety;&nbsp;landscaping, and others as required. ODC will provide observation and management services&nbsp;for GSA through the DB's Architect of Record design development, construction documents,&nbsp;and final construction completion and turnover. The overall goal of the ODC's Design and&nbsp;Construction Consulting Services is to inspect and monitor all work performed by the DB&nbsp;contractor to ensure compliance with contract requirements, including reviewing critical&nbsp;submittals, requests for information, and shop drawings for accuracy, completeness, and&nbsp;compliance with contract requirements and full intent of the Design Build Bridging Package.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The new LPOE in Madawaska, Maine will replace the current 8,990 gross square feet, 1959&nbsp;building situated on a 0.9 acre site that does not meet the U.S. Government's requirements.&nbsp;The current facility connects Madawaska, Maine with Edmundston, New Brunswick via the&nbsp;International Bridge, spanning the St. John River. The International Bridge is nearing the end&nbsp;of its useful life based on its current condition and functionality. As a result, the Maine&nbsp;Department of Transportation (MaineDOT) determined the need for a five ton posting of the&nbsp;bridge, restricting all commercial vehicles over five tons, including tractor-trailers, box trucks,&nbsp;buses, ambulances, and fire trucks, effective October 27, 2017. The bridge posting requires<br />all vehicles in excess of five tons to use neighboring LPOE's either at Fort Kent (20 miles&nbsp;South West) or at Van Buren (25 miles Southeast). This restriction has affected communities&nbsp;on both sides of the border, and limited the ability to provide ambulance and fire services to&nbsp;these border communities. The MaineDOT's construction of a new International Bridge at a&nbsp;new location requires GSA's simultaneous design and construction of the new LPOE. These&nbsp;two separate projects will result in a fully operational CBP LPOE upon completion and opening&nbsp;of the new International Bridge.<br /><br /></div>
<div>GSA's main goal is to provide a fully operational LPOE upon the completion and opening of&nbsp;the new Madawaska-Edmundston International Bridge before winter 2022/2023. The facility&nbsp;should be a long-lasting and durable asset. The project should encompass superior buildings&nbsp;and grounds with low maintenance and operating costs. The buildings and site should be&nbsp;functional, technologically efficient, and flexible while providing a welcoming gateway into and&nbsp;out of the United States. Building Information Modeling (BIM) will be used during the duration&nbsp;of the project as a means to ensure the integration of all aspects of the project. It is important&nbsp;to define the project within the context of the MaineDOT's design, engineering and&nbsp;construction of the new Madawaska-Edmundston International Bridge, and the Town Of&nbsp;Madawaska's water and sewer upgrade project.</div>
<div><br />For more information on the separate LPOE and bridge projects, please review the Draft<br />Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) listed below, along with the GSA's and&nbsp;MaineDOT's respective project websites.</div>

<p>1.	General Business Information-business name, address, DUNS/CAGE, etc.<br />2.	Business Size/Socioeconomic Status (Large, Small, 8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone)<br />3.	Information which addresses the vendor's ability to provide all of the required VoIP equipment specified in the attachment in a timely manner (to include the existence of reseller agreements with all the manufacturers of the required equipment).<br />4.	Information on whether vendor offers this VoIP equipment under any Government-wide vehicles, such as GSA Federal Supply Schedule, NASA SEWP V, NITAAC CIO-CS, or any other Government-wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC).</p>

If the Offeror is a Joint Venture (JV), the JV entity shall have valid SAM registration in the SAM database representing the JV as one business/firm/entity. If at the time of award an Offeror is not actively and successfully registered in the SAM database, the Government reserves the right to award to the next prospective Offeror.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: <br />To ensure nation-wide emergency preparedness and response, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) delegated the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Emergency Support Function (ESF) #3, Public Works and Engineering. To execute the ESF #3, USACE implemented the Advance Contract Initiative (ACI) which includes contracts for Debris Management Services (DMS). The Rock Island District (MVR) Contracting Office has been assigned lead for executing the re-compete ACI RCDMS. In support of this mission, this acquisition strategy proposes award of 20 Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Single Award Task Order Contracts (SATOCs) with a total capacity of $4.9B.</p>
<p>USACE defines debris as materials originating from the effects of any natural or man-made catastrophe or major disaster. Materials included are of both man-made and natural origins, and may include hazardous/toxic/radiological wastes (HTRW). Man-made debris, construction and demolition (C&amp;D) materials includes, but are not limited to, lumber, concrete, asphalt, masonry, metals, and plastics. Debris of natural origins includes, but are not limited to, all vegetative debris (grass, shrubs, stumps, and trees), slide materials (clay, sand, gravel, rock, residual solids), and earth collected with the debris while loading trucks.</p>
<p>Contractors will be required to provide both pre-event planning and post event activities. The pre-event planning will enable the contractor's Planning Team to serve in an advisory capacity to provide technical assistance which may include evaluation of the disaster area, estimation of debris volumes, locating debris storage, and determining resources required. Having a primary contractor engaged during pre-event planning allows the Government and the contractor the opportunity to conduct preparedness and planning exercise. It also provides the quickest response after an event, especially to an event with no advance warning. The post-event activities will enable USACE to provide contractor services for debris removal, reduction, and disposal within 24 hours of receiving a mission assignment.</p>
<p>POINT-OF-CONTACT: <br />The point-of-contact for this procurement is Contract Specialist, Sally A. Duncan, at sally.a.duncan@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>This announcement serves as the Advance Notice for this project. Responses to this synopsis are not required.</p>
