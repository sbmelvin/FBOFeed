Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.

Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) plans to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) to repair the Research Aircraft Hangar B4802 HVAC system located at Edward Air Force Base, Edwards, CA.
<p><br />The purpose of the project is to address the ailing mechanical systems inside Hangar B4802. This project will include the repair-by-replacement of the hangar's evaporative cooling system with the additive option to install radiant heating. The evaporative cooling units are to be demolished and replaced. The existing ductwork will be reused and repaired. Some of the cooling units are located on steel elevated platforms, which will be demolished as well. The demolished systems will be replaced by a new system capable of providing adequate cooling to the hangar, as required. The existing radiant-slab heating system is to be abandoned in place due to it no longer being cost efficient to run, given its age and frequency of burst pipes if radiant heater option is exercised. A new heating system is to be designed and installed to provide adequate heating as necessitated by the hangar as an option. The exhaust system will be redesigned to be functional with new cooling system. All of these systems shall then be integrated to the building's existing building automation system (BAS). This project will not increase AFRC's square footage.</p>
<p>The order of magnitude for the procurement is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 and the effort shall be completed within 360 calendar days after notice to proceed.</p>
<p>This procurement is a HUBZone Small Business set-aside.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 238220 and $15 million, respectively.</p>
<p>The anticipated release date of the IFB is on or about Tuesday July 5, 2016 with an anticipated offer closing date of on or about Thursday, August 4, 2016.</p>
<p>The firm date for receipt of bids or proposals will be stated in the IFB. Drawings will be available for download with the solicitation over the internet.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE AND SITE VISIT RECOMMENDATION---------------
<p>Conifer Release at Devil's Garden RD</p>
<p>A full solicitation is anticipated closer to the project start date. The purpose of this early pre-solicitation is to recommend that interested parties VISIT THE SITE(S) in advance of inclement weather common for the area.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be set aside at least to small business, and may be further set aside to a specific type of small business concern.</p>
<p>Project Description: <br />This contract will secure services for Conifer Release. There are 941 acres and units are a mix of areas planted in the spring of 2014 and 2015. Logging occurred within the units planted in 2014 only. These units are within the Barry Point Burn of the Devil's Garden RD in Alturas, CA and planted in the spring of 2014 or 2015 with Ponderosa pine. Stocking surveys were conducted on the units in the fall of 2014 and 2016.</p>
<p>Every live planted tree shall be released from competing vegetation. Release shall be to a 5 foot radius. Vegetation shall not be scraped out of the 5 foot radius but cut and left as green mulch within the cutting area. No damage shall occur to the trees during release. Vegetation near the stem of the seedlings may need to be hand pulled. Clump grass shall be turned upside down with roots left in the air. Current vegetation consists of snow brush, squaw carpet, manzanita sprouts and grass/forbs.</p>
<p>Some units harbor noxious weeds. Specific actions will be required of the Contractor to prevent spreading these weeds. There is one sensitive listed plant occurring in some of the units with specific grubbing requirements.</p>
<p>The estimated start work date is April 24th 2016, however the actual start work date may vary from this due to weather and ground conditions. Contract time has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Road Conditions to all Units: <br />The specified roads are accessible by a four-wheel drive vehicle when road conditions are favorable. Inaccessibility due to snow, fallen trees, mud, slides, or washouts may occur on the secondary roads.</p>
<p><br />Site Visitation:<br />The purpose of an early pre-solicitation/ synopsis is to recommend that interested parties visit the site at their convenience in advance of winter weather. Exact contract start date is dependent upon site conditions and award may be made in advance of spring thaw. Information regarding local weather can be requested by contacting the Devil's Garden Ranger Station front desk (ask for Steve) at 530-233-5811. See maps for project locations.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE. </strong>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Molecular Epidemiology Assay Support (MEAS)</p>
<p>The mission of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) National Cancer Institute (NCI) is to conduct population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. Many of the studies undertaken by the Division include analyses performed using human biological specimens obtained through family and population-based collection efforts. For approximately thirty (30) years DCEG investigators have been relying on contract services to provide technical assistance in the areas of specimen collection, receipt, processing and in identifying laboratories to perform state-of-the-art testing using high quality biological specimens collected from clinical and field sites.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to provide support services for studies on the genetic and other cellular events which influence the onset of different types of cancer. Specifically, the Contractor will provide support services for: 1) the procurement, storage and shipment of specimen collection supplies and equipment to international and domestic specimen collection sites and other specimen testing and processing locations; 2) performance of state-of-the-art molecular assays and monitor laboratory performance; and 3) to prepare specimens for transport to testing laboratories by aliquotting, labeling and batching, as needed. Residual specimens will be sent to the NCI Central Repository for long-term storage.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, including secure computers, and facilities, to provide support services to DCEG studies in the areas of receipt and processing of predominantly previously frozen human biospecimens, aliquotting of biospecimens and batching samples for dissemination to laboratories for testing, the ability to identify state-of-the-art laboratories to perform testing, the ability to monitor the performance of laboratory testing, and temporary storage of biospecimens until they are ready to be transferred to the NCI Central Repository in Frederick, Maryland.</p>
<p>Some of the major activities the Contractor will be required to be performed are:</p>
<p>1)  Provide, prepare and transport appropriate supplies, equipment and procedures for collecting, processing, testing and aliquotting biospecimens to designated field sites, processing and testing centers as directed by the COR. The Contractor shall provide supplies for the shipment of specimens back to the Contractor or other designated facility by the COR.</p>
<p>2) Perform aliquotting of previously frozen biospecimens (e.g., sera, plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, urine, feces, saliva/buccal cells, and tumor tissue) as requested by the COR or the NCI Principal Investigator.</p>
<p>3) Perform molecular assays in support of DCEG epidemiology studies.</p>
<p>4) Maintain an interim repository for the storage of human biospecimens and environmental samples (e.g., water and soil samples) that are either destined to be sent to laboratories for testing, are to be aliquotted, or are waiting to be returned to the NCI Central Repository for long-term storage. The total number of specimens is expected to be less than 20,000 and shall be stored in -80&deg;C mechanical freezers.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), NAS Patuxent River, MD, intends to negotiate and award an Advance Acquisition Contract (AAC) for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 3 and 4 in Fiscal Year (FY)17 and fixed price type contracts for LRIP 3 and 4 in FY 18, with LRIP 4 as an option to be exercised in FY19 to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGC), San Diego, CA, on a sole-source basis to procure the MQ-4C Triton Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) (formerly known as Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAS) and related supplies and services.
<p><br />The LRIP 3 and 4 AAC will procure long lead items (e.g., components, material, parts, and associated efforts) required to maintain the planned production schedules. The LRIP 3 and LRIP 4 contracts will each include up to three aircraft, one main operating base, one forward operating base, trade studies, mission control systems, non-recurring engineering costs (e.g., parts obsolescence engineering and productionization), engineering change orders, integrated logistics support (ILS), interim contractor support, trainers, and support equipment.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(C)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only one Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements" for the proposed action for LRIP 3 and 4. NGC is the sole designer and developer of the MQ-4C Triton UAS. This contract is a follow-on contract for the production of a major system and award to any other source other than NGC would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement. The Government will consider all information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract actions based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing via e-mail to the attention of Jacob Leitch or Justin Francis using the contact information provided in the synopsis. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation: Ms. Vicky Harper-Hall, Socio-Economic Programs Sector Manager, e-mail: Vicky.harper-hall@ngc.com or phone (301) 331-3824.</p>

Typical unscheduled services include clean-up of overflowed restroom fixtures, spills, bodily fluids, muddy or wet entrances, broken glass, carpet spot cleaning and other similar items.  

Procurement Method: Contracting by Negotiation.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 561720 and the annual size standard is $18,000,000.00.  The contract term will be a base period of one year plus four option years.  The total term of the contract, including all options, will not exceed 60 months.  The Government will not synopsize the options when exercised.
 IDIQ work will be issued via the DOD EMALL, a web-based ordering system, using Government purchase cards.  This contract will replace a contract for similar services awarded in 2013 for $1,167,637.68.  Information about the current contract and the incumbent contractor (e.g., value of last option exercised, firm name, address, etc.) will be included in the solicitation package.  Requests under the Freedom of Information Act are not required for this information.  Offerors can view and/or download the solicitation, and any attachments, at https://www.neco.navy.mil/ when it becomes available.  All interested offerors shall register at the website. No notice of solicitation activity will be provided to interested offerors.
  Based on market research, there is a reasonable expectation that offers would be obtained from at least two responsible 8(a) concerns.  Since the requirement is currently in the 8(a) program, the solicitation will be issued as an 8(a) competitive set-aside.  The NAVFAC Hawaii small business office concurs with the set-aside determination.

The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit a technical proposal, past performance and experience information, and a price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  Proposal receipt date is approximate.

<DESC>This project will renovate the existing 2-story 66,800 SF Main Exchange Building at Naval Station Newport, RI. Project includes selective demolition, repair and renovation of the existing commercial retail and administrative areas; and a 1,600 SF addition which will expand and renovate a portion of the store in order to create a Package Store within the building footprint. The facility shall remain operational during the renovation. Phasing will be required.

Construction will provide a new monumental stair, walk-in beer cave, new check-outs and Customer Service Area, audio visual display area, and add a new H/C accessible exterior entry ramp. Improvements will renovate the existing Retail sales areas, Barber Shop, and Food Court seating area and will relocate the existing Electronics Department, Conference Room, Employee Lounge, and Cash Office.

The Expansion portion of this project will relocate the existing NEX Package Store and incorporate it into the footprint of the existing NEX Garden Shop.
 The Package Store will be a department within the main Exchange and not a standalone operation. One contiguous retail space for a new package store will be created by converting the partially covered outside areas of the Garden Shop and portion of an enclosed but unconditioned Garden Shop space into NEX interior space and removing existing exterior partitions separating the interior and exterior Garden Shop space. A new walk-in beverage cooler will also be installed at existing interior NEX space that is currently occupied by a smaller reach-in cooler and by NEX Sales floor space. A new automatic sliding entrance door and interior vestibule will be created as well. Existing exterior walls around the Garden Center will need to be demolished and rebuilt to comply with current UFC building envelope standards, and the existing building structure will be modified in order to allow the building addition to be structurally isolated from the reminder of the existing NEX building, to comply with ATFP Standard 7.

<DESC><p>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby soliciting information under this Request for Information (RFI) to determine whether or not there are interested and available vendor sources capable of meeting the identified requirements. This document is for information and planning purposes only and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.</p>
<p><br />The Titan Haze Simulation (THS) experiment developed at the Ames COSmIC research laboratory facility is designed to study planetary analogs for the analysis of return data from space missions such as CASSINI. To achieve NASA SMD programmatic goals, we need to purchase variable angle transmittance and reflectance accessories along with polarizers and their holders, in order to characterize the scattering properties of planetary aerosol analogs produced in the THS experiment. These accessories allow the samples to be characterized over a wide incidence and emittance angle range in a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer.</p>
<p>The variable angle transmittance and reflectance accessories (VATA and Seagull) will be mounted on an FTIR spectrometer to measure the angular light distribution of the THS samples in both transmission and reflection. These measurements will be used to extract accurate optical constants for use in the analysis of observational data from Cassini and future exoplanetary mission.<br /><br /><strong>Responses to this RFI should address the following:</strong></p>
<p>(1) Organization/Company Info: <br />a. Name and address of firm, <br />b. Cage Code and DUNS Number (if available),<br />c. Points of contact name(s) with phone number(s) and email address(es), <br />d. Website (if applicable), and name of parent organization (if applicable).<br />e. Business size (Based on NAICS code) and/or Socioeconomic designation (i.e., large, small, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB),<br />f. Average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees;<br />g. List of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement)</p>
<p>(2) Technical Functional Requirements -</p>
<p>Ability to meet technical requirements identified in the following:</p>
<p>- Seagull Variable Angle Reflection Accessory for FTIR spectrometers<br />- Standard wire grid polarizer (KRS-5 substrate) for the Seagull<br />- Special right-handed wire-grid polarizer (KRS-5 substrate) for the Seagull<br />- Variable Angle Transmission Accessory (VATA) for FTIR spectrometers<br />- Standard Slide Holder for FTIR spectrometers<br />- Special Slide Holder for FTIR spectrometers<br />- Custom-designed cylindrical tube to support coated window sample within the Seagull specular reflectance sample holder</p>
<p>To infer the most accurate optical constants, the widest angle coverage is required. The VATA and Seagull offer the widest angle range available on the market</p>
<p>Interested firms are requested to submit their response to this RFI via email only to Mia Blessing at email m.t.blessing@nasa.gov, no later than 4:00PM PST on October 10, 2016 the stated response date.

<DESC><p>WIDEBAND SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS CONTROL PLANE WAVEFORM SOURCES SOUGHT FOR Wideband SATCOM Trend Analysis and Anomaly Resolution Sub-system/WSOMS Mediated Interoperability Infrastructure (WSTARS/WMII)</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS NOTICE IS ISSUED SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) OR A PROMISE TO ISSUE A RFP IN THE FUTURE. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A&nbsp;RESPONSE. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THIS NOTICE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND IS NOT BINDING ON THE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>1. Purpose</p>
<p>Project Manager, Defense Communications and Army Transmission Systems (PM DCATS), Product Lead, Wideband Enterprise Satellite Systems (PL WESS), Fort Belvoir, VA is seeking information from large and small businesses experienced in providing and supporting military satellite control in order to gage industry capacity and capability for providing the operational implementation of a cloud like solution for network management for communications within the SATCOM network operations center.</p>
<p>The WMII will utilize existing FlexPod equipment to set the basis of the full solution. Other sub-systems within the SATCOM Network Operations Centers will be virtualized on the WMII infrastructure, and the communications paths amongst these sub-systems will comply with the WMII Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). In addition to virtualization and SOA, the WMII will house the consolidated/centralized database (DB) for utilization between all sub-systems. The existing sub-system DB's may require the utilization of an Extract-Translate-Load (ETL) to populate the consolidated/centralized database.</p>
<p>The WSTARS will provide the overarching management of all sub-systems, providing situational awareness to all users of the Wideband SATCOM Operations Management System (WSOMS). The software developed to accomplish this will provide a visual map of the networks managed, data analytic tools to support decision making, trouble ticketing to track issues. The networks managed will be both the terrestrial WSOMS and RMCE networks, and the satellite WGS networks. The data analytic tool will be set to support the Controllers, Operations Analyst, Company Commanders, Wideband Watch Officer and any other deemed personnel, to make succinct decisions to correct issues within the satellite network. The tool will be customizable to capture the needs of those tasked with controlling the WGS constellation. Future development of trend analysis and anomaly resolution will progress to an automated correct of these errors based upon Army Forces Strategic Command (ARSTRAT) Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The trouble ticket software shall provide traceability and continuity by carrier/customer links within the satellite network. It shall be a query-able tool to support the data analytics and situational awareness.</p>
<p>2. General Objectives</p>
<p>The Government is developing the architecture for the next generation Wideband Control SATCOM system to help improve situational awareness and utilization of Wideband SATCOM satellite resources. Part of the effort is to identify commercial solutions for a Wideband Satellite Communications Control Plane waveform.</p>

<DESC>See Attachments&nbsp;for entire&nbsp;Request For Information<br /><br />Overview
<p>The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) seeks capability and pricing information in order to craft our requirement for systemwide paraeducator professional learning. Depending on FY17 funding, DoDEA hopes to issue a solicitation in the fall of 2016 and make an award in the first quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>Suspense <br />October 12, 2017</p>
<p>Responses<br />Send responses to David Johansen, Special Education Program Manager and Brian Pritchard, Business Acquisition Program Manager at the following addresses:</p>
<p>david.johansen@hq.dodea.edu and brian.pritchard@hq.dodea.edu, respectively.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>DoDEA serves the dependents of military and civilian employees by providing PK-12 instruction to approximately 72,000 students. DoDEA's eight districts have 167 brick-and-mortar schools located in seven states, eleven countries, Guam and Puerto Rico. In addition, DoDEA operates a fully accredited Virtual High School with its main office in Virginia and with teaching hubs in Germany and Okinawa. DoDEA's curriculum, resources and achievement scores on standardized assessments compare favorably to high-performing US public schools.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Although DoDEA paraeducators have received professional learning from the district or regional levels, no systemic paraeducator professional learning has occurred in at least 20 years. <br /><br />The military does not allow service members with children who have extremely severe disabilities to be stationed overseas. Therefore, DoDEA schools in Europe and the Pacific have relatively lower numbers of paraeducators compared to our stateside schools.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>DoDEA requires asynchronous, web-based professional learning to meet the needs of our novice and experienced paraeducators working with a wide variety special education students systemwide. DoDEA requires novice professional learning to cover topics in such areas as student behavior, classroom instruction, and understanding of disabilities. Each paraeducator is required to complete a basic course of professional learning equivalent to four undergraduate semester credits and to have additional professional learning equivalent to two undergraduate semester credits during each year of employment. Paraeducators must be able to do their coursework at their own pace.<br /><br />DoDEA currently employs 1,296 educators worldwide-US, 561; Europe, 415; and Pacific, 320. Based on student enrollment trends, those numbers may decline slightly during the life of the contract. DoDEA expects to award one contract for a period of one 12-month base year and four 12-month option years.<br /><br />See Attachments for entire Request For Information</p>

<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">DISCLAIMER: This Potential Sources Sought (PSS) notice is issued as market research and is intended for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an RFP or commitment by the Government. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation) nor a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. The information provided in response to this PSS is for discussion purposes only and any potential strategy that may be developed from these discussions would be subject of a separate, future announcement.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">The information received in response to this PSS may be utilized by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in developing an acquisition strategy, and requirements documents (i.e. Statement of Objectives, Performance Work Statement, or Purchase Description).

<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">DESCRIPTION: DLA Troop Support - Medical in Philadelphia anticipates possible award(s) to upgrade software and hardware for the Navy's current Radiology Voice Dictation System for 10 sites consisting of Contiguous United States (CONUS) locations and Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) locations. The award(s) will procure software and hardware to integrate with radiation dose monitoring software. This integration needs to integrate data from Radimetrics dose monitoring software into final reports. In addition to software and hardware upgrades, the award(s) will procure training for end user radiologists. This upgrade will coincide with the Navy's conversion of its user-based licensing structure to a volume based structure so that system administrators are able to create provider profiles without the assistance of the manufacturer. With this upgrade, the Navy is also seeking to purchase associated hardware to include microphones that will maximize the use of the software upgrade. The potential award(s) will not procure activation of peer review, or other functionality with this configuration.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">The Government plans to procure these items as commercial items through fixed priced award(s).</p>

Description of Services
VA Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS) requires the services of a contractor to provide all tools, materials, equipment, labor, and transportation to perform testing,  maintenance, and repairs of the fire hydrants to include the 5 year testing requirements by NFPA 25, 291, and manufacture's recommendations.  This will include annual and five (5) year testing, underground and exposed piping and flow test. 
The intention of this project will be:
"	Contractor shall provide maintenance, testing, and inspections in accordance with the manufacture's specifications, NFPA 25, and NFPA 291.  All manufacturer and proposed maintenance schedules shall be submitted to COR no later than fifteen (15) days after contract award.  COR will review and approval schedule.  All grease, oils and other material related to maintenance shall be cleaned from exterior of hydrant.
"	Contractor shall test the underground and exposed piping flow test (Five year test).  Contractor shall test each hydrant, record hydrant pressure, and hydrant flow per NFPA 25 and standard testing operating procedures.   Flow tests shall be made at flows representative of those expected during a fire for the purpose of comparing the direction loss characteristics of the pipe with those expected for the particular type of pipe involved, with due consideration given to the age of the pipe. 
"	Contractors shall conduct an annual hydrant test of each hydrant.  Hydrant shall be opened fully and water flowed until all foreign material has cleared.  Flows shall be maintained for not less than one minute.  After operation, dry barrel and wall hydrants shall be observed for proper drainage from barrel. If full drainage of barrel exceeds 60 minutes or where the groundwater level is above that of the hydrant drain the hydrant drain shall be plugged and the water in the barrel shall be pumped out, and clearly identified as needing pumping after operation.
"	Contractor shall insure that no chlorinated or chloramines treated water enters the VAPAHCS private storm drain system.  Contractor shall install a de-chlorinating device at the discharge side of the fire hydrant to remove all detectable amount of chlorine per federal, state, county, city or local requirements and regulations.
"	Contractor shall remove outlet nozzle cap and check seat for leakage visually at each valve on wet barrel hydrants.  Valve is to be operated using a special test outlet nozzle cap.  If stem action is tight, repeat operation several times until opening and closing action is smooth and free.  If hard operation persists, remove valve stem, clean threads with wire brush and lubricate.  While under pressure check for leakage at joints, around outlet nozzles, at packing or seals and past outlet nozzle caps.  If leakage is observed, tighten outlet nozzles; replace O-rings or gaskets, as needed.  If leakage or any other condition such as broken parts cannot be corrected during the inspection the condition shall be noted on final report.  All non-functioning fire hydrants shall be placed out of service and clearly indicated as such at the hydrant.  Remove all nozzle caps and inspect for thread damage from impact or cross threading.  Clean and lubricate outlet nozzle threads and use caps to check for easy operation of threads.  Check nozzle cap chains for free action at each cap.  If binding is observed open the loop around the cap until action is free enough to prevent kinking during removal of the cap under emergency situations.  Replace all damaged or missing chains.
The Government requests that interested parties provide the following capability information to the Contract Specialist, Parvinder Brar by e mail at: Parvinder.brar@va.gov by close of business October 7, 2016:
(a) Business Size (Large/Small)
(b) Business Socio-Economic Status (SDVOSB, WOSB, 8(a), HUBZone, etc.)
(c) SAM record
(d) DUNS number
(e) Ability and experience with similar projects. 
(f) List of projects similar in scope.
The Government will use this information when determining its business type decision.  
This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government and no contract will be awarded as a direct result of this Sources Sought announcement.

<DESC>This is a <strong>Sources Sought Notice OPM1016S002 to identify Small Businesses</strong> that are capable of contractor support services to help operate its Performance Accountability Council (PAC) Program Management Office (PMO) and Security, Suitability, Credentialing Line of Business (SSCLoB).  These services include a range of functional expertise areas necessary to execute the PAC's mission of Security, Suitability/Fitness, and Credentialing (SSC) reform.  The PMO and SSCLoB require a contractor capable of providing flexible solutions that reflect the dynamic nature of SSC reform. <br /><br />This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotations.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they affect a potential offeror's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation, which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach. Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this notice. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background: </strong></span><br />The PAC was established in 2008 under Executive Order 13467 to ensure an efficient, practical, reciprocal, and aligned system for investigating and determining suitability for Government employment, contractor employee fitness, and eligibility for access to classified information.  Accountable to the President for achieving SSC reform goals, the PAC is chaired by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Deputy Director for Management.  <br />In 2014 the PMO was established to support the implementation of reform initiatives prioritized by the PAC.  As part of these efforts, the SSCLoB was established in 2015 to focus on the development of enterprise-wide solutions that the interagency community could leverage to optimize investments, simplify service delivery, and promote community efficiency/effectiveness. <br /> <br />Broad objectives for these reforms are established in the PAC Strategic Intent (2017-2021) document and are coordinated throughout SSC community agencies.  The PMO is supported by a mix of direct employees, detailees from community agencies, and contractor personnel.  Contractor support provides the PMO with a flexible source of expertise that can quickly adapt to the shifting needs of the reform portfolio.   These changes in priorities can occur through a natural progression as the focus of reform alternates between different areas of expertise, such as policy and technology.  Additionally, priorities may shift based on external events, such as supplemental Legislative or Executive Branch requirements driven by security incidents.  These include events such as the Navy Yard shooting or the OPM Data Breach.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capability Statement / Information Sought:</span></strong><br />Interested small businesses are encouraged to respond to this notice.

The Government reserves the right to independently test for 508 Compliance before delivery. The Contractor shall be able to demonstrate 508 Compliance upon delivery.

Automated test tools and manual techniques are used in the VA Section 508 compliance assessment.  Additional information concerning tools and resources can be found at http://www.section508.va.gov/section508/Resources.asp.

<a href="mailto:calvin.howard@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Solicitation Number: N65236-16-R-0001  Request for Information (RFI)  Advanced Analytics Technical Solution (AATS)  DUE: 10/11/2016   On 16 September 2016, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic issued a pre-solicitation notice to inform industry about an upcoming solicitation (N65236-16-R-0001) and to encourage interested parties to participate in the Advisory Multi-Step Process (FAR 15.202).  SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic is also considering the use of product demonstrations as an evaluation factor for this solicitation, and is seeking Industry feedback concerning this approach.  The product demonstrations would be held at SPAWARSYSCEN Atlantic facilities in Charleston, SC.  The contractor would supply all necessary hardware and software required to demonstrate and validate required AATS software product capabilities in accordance with solicitation instructions for product demonstration, and the contractor would lead the demonstration.  While the contractor would supply the hardware for the demonstration, the Government would provide the specifications for the hardware, and would be similar or equivalent to the technical specifications found in Attachment 6 of the pre-solicitation notice (IAS Hardware and Software Information).   Demonstrations  The Government is considering demonstrations of the following three capabilities:  1. The capability of the AATS software to import and manage the Government-provided AATS ontology. 2. The capability of the AATS software to support the intelligence analyst in multiple phases of the intelligence cycle, in both connected and disconnected modes of operation. 3. The capability of the AATS software to support third-party development of AATS software plugins and data integrations.  For each of these demonstrations, the Government would specify the tasks to be performed and the order in which the tasks will be performed during the demonstration.  These constraints are not intended to prevent the contractor from demonstrating unique aspects of the capability that may provide additional value to the Government, provided that the aspects have already been documented as part of the contractors response to the RFP. The Government would provide all source data and materials required to conduct the demonstration, and intends for all source data and materials to be UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO.   Employment of the System Usability Scale (SUS)  For the demonstration of the capability of the AATS software to support the intelligence analyst in multiple phases of the intelligence cycle, the Government is considering the employment of the System Usability Scale (SUS) to measure the usability of the AATS software.  The SUS, per the usability.gov website (https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html) , is a 10-item questionnaire originally developed in 1986, and has been used to evaluate a wide variety of products and services.  The SUS has become an industry standard, with references in over 1300 articles and publications.  The Government evaluators would score the following ten questions with one of five responses that range from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree:  1. I think that I would like to use this software frequently. 2. I found the software unnecessarily complex. 3. I thought that the software was easy to use. 4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this software. 5. I found the various functions in this software were well integrated. 6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this software. 7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this software very quickly. 8. I found the software very cumbersome to use. 9. I feel very confident that I could the software. 10. I would need to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this software.  The Government would use the SUS score as one measure in the overall (adjectival) rating of the demonstration of support for the intelligence cycle.   Requested Information  Respondents are requested to provide comments/feedback concerning the Governments proposed use of product demonstrations as an evaluation factor and employment of the System Usability Scale (SUS) to measure the usability of the AATS software.  Comments should be provided via email to the Contract Specialist at calvin.howard@navy.mil.  A NOTE REGARDING THIS RFI: This RFI is for information gathering and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer. The Government DOES NOT intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />Addenda to FAR 52.212-4 <br />1. Stop Work Order, FAR Clause 52.242-15 (August 1989) <br />[In accordance with FAR 42.1305 (b)(1) and FAR 12.302, the clause at FAR 52.242-15, Stop Work Order is incorporated herein.]<br />(a) The Contracting Officer may, at any time, by written order to the Contractor, require the Contractor to stop all, or any part, of the work called for by this contract for a period of 90 days after the order is delivered to the Contractor, and for any further period to which the parties may agree. The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued under this clause. Upon receipt of the order, the Contractor shall immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize the incurrence of costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period of work stoppage. Within a period of 90 days after a stop-work is delivered to the Contractor, or within any extension of that period to which the parties shall have agreed, the Contracting Officer shall either- <br />(1) Cancel the stop-work order; or <br />(2) Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the Government, clause of this contract. <br />(b) If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled or the period of the order or any extension thereof expires, the Contractor shall resume work. The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if- <br />(1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and <br />(2) The Contractor asserts its right to the adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that, if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon the claim submitted at any time before final payment under this contract. <br />(c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement. <br />(d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Patient Scales. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Patient Scales products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific, and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Patient Scales in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Patient Scales will be established approximately January 2017 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately February 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Patient Scales. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Patient Scales.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Patient Scales. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $379,302. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Three items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 50.2% ($190,548.91) of the total volume in sales ($379,302). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.</strong><br /><br />C.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Surgical Dressing Tapes. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Surgical Dressing Tapes products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Surgical Dressing Tapes in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Surgical Dressing Tapes will be established approximately March 2017 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately April 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Surgical Dressing Tapes. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Surgical Dressing Tapes.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Surgical Dressing Tapes. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,413,395. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Fifteen items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 73.3% ($1,035,639) of the total volume in sales ($1,413,395). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below.

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their email submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C.

<p>FAR 52.219-28, Post Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation (Jul 2013)<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--<br />Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.<br />Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.<br />(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall represent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:<br />(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.<br />(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.<br />(3) For long-term contracts-<br />(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and<br />(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.<br />(c) The Contractor shall represent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this representation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards .<br />(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.<br />(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.<br />(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.<br />(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following representation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the representation was completed:<br />The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 331210 assigned to solicitation number NNK17593428.</p>

<p><br />The following NASA FAR Supplement provisions and clauses are also applicable to this procurement:</p>
<p>1852.215-84 Ombudsman. (NOV 2011)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. <br />(b) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the installation ombudsman, whose name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address may be found at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html . Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may be referred to the Agency ombudsman identified at the above URL. Please do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer or as specified elsewhere in this document.<br />(End of clause)<br />1852.225-70 Export Licenses. (FEB 2000)</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120 through 130, and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract. In the absence of available license exemptions/exceptions, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing foreign persons in the performance of this contract, including instances where the work is to be performed on-site at NASA Kennedy Space Center, where the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this clause apply to its subcontractors.</p>
<p><br />1852.233-70 Protests to NASA. (OCT 2002)</p>
<p>1852.237-73 Release of Sensitive Information. (JUN 2005)</p>
<p>(a) As used in this clause, "sensitive information" refers to information, not currently in the public domain, that the Contractor has developed at private expense, that may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and that may be sensitive or privileged.</p>
<p>(b) In accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies heavily on the support of various service providers. To support NASA activities and functions, these service providers, as well as their subcontractors and their individual employees, may need access to sensitive information submitted by the Contractor under this contract. By submitting this proposal or performing this contract, the Contractor agrees that NASA may release to its service providers, their subcontractors, and their individual employees, sensitive information submitted during the course of this procurement, subject to the enumerated protections mandated by the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information.</p>
<p>(c)(1) The Contractor shall identify any sensitive information submitted in support of this proposal or in performing this contract. For purposes of identifying sensitive information, the Contractor may, in addition to any other notice or legend otherwise required, use a notice similar to the following:</p>
<p>Mark the title page with the following legend:</p>
<p>This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that support management activities and administrative functions. To gain access to this sensitive information, a service provider's contract must contain the clause at NFS 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. Consistent with this clause, the service provider shall not duplicate, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use this information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages (insert page numbers or other identification of pages).</p>
<p>Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to restrict with the following legend:</p>
<p>Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or document.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any claim that particular information is "sensitive." This evaluation shall consider the time and resources necessary to protect the information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless the Contracting Officer decides, with the advice of Center counsel, that reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor's claim that particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and their employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA in accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, the service provider must be operating under a contract that contains the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. This clause obligates the service provider to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including the Organizational Conflicts of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the contract has incorporated as a compliance document.</p>
<p>(2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession only for the purpose of performing the services specified in its contract.</p>
<p>(3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from unauthorized use and disclosure.</p>
<p>(4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees that need it to perform services under its contract.</p>
<p>(5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to persons and entities outside of the service provider's organization.</p>
<p>(6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information about their obligations to utilize it only to perform the services specified in its contract and to safeguard it from unauthorized use and disclosure.</p>
<p>(7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has received and will comply with training on the authorized uses and mandatory protections of sensitive information needed in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply with all reasonable security procedures, report any breaches to the Contracting Officer, and implement any necessary corrective actions.</p>
<p>(e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for operating an information technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the service provider's contract shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause requires the service provider to implement an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use. Service provider personnel requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to these information technology systems are subject to screening using the standard National Agency Check (NAC) forms appropriate to the level of risk for adverse impact to NASA missions. The Contracting Officer may allow the service provider to conduct its own screening, provided the service provider employs substantially equivalent screening procedures.</p>
<p>(f) This clause does not affect NASA's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (g), suitably modified to reflect the relationship of the parties, in all subcontracts that may require the furnishing of sensitive information.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2</p>
<p>Evaluation. Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation process. Award will be made to the responsible Quoter on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for technical factors. The Government intends to make an award without conducting discussions. After the initial evaluation of quotations is completed, if one or more quotations are rated Acceptable Technical, the initial evaluation will become the final evaluation of quotations and award will be made without discussions to the lowest priced quote. If any one (1) technical subfactor is rated Unacceptable after the initial evaluation, the technical factor will be rated Unacceptable and the quote will no longer be considered for award. If all quotations submitted result in an unacceptable technical evaluation, then clarifications may be necessary. In that event, the Government evaluation team will evaluate the quoter's response to the Government exchanges with each Quoter.</p>
<p>FACTOR I - TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARDS:</p>
<p>The Quoter's technical quote will be evaluated using the following standards for a final rating:</p>
<p>1. Acceptable - A quote that meets the Government's technical requirements identified in the Request for Quotation.</p>
<p>2. Unacceptable - Quote A quote that fails to meet the Government's technical requirements identified in the Request for Quotation..</p>
<p>FACTOR II- PAST PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:</p>
<p>The Government will use the following standards to rate Past Performance:</p>
<p>1. Acceptable - Based on the Quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the Quoter's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)</p>
<p>2. Unacceptable - Based on the Quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the Quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort. (See note below.)</p>
<p>NOTE: In the case of a Quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the Quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the Quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, unknown shall be<br />considered acceptable.</p>
<p>FACTOR III: PRICE. The Government will select the quote that is based upon the lowest evaluated price, technically acceptable quote. All Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) must be priced by the quoter. If the quoter failed to price all CLINs, the quote will not be considered for award. The extended amount for each contract line item will be added up for a grand total and will be used to calculate the Quoter's total price for the Base Period and all Option Periods. The Government may determine that a quote is Unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(a) Options. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(b) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.</p>
<p>(c) The word "quoter" shall be substituted for the word "offeror" wherever it appears in FAR 52.212-3, Alternate I and DFARS 252.212-7000.</p>

<p>This will be a LPTA procurement. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with Offerors.

An overall technical rating must be at least "ACCEPTABLE" in order to be eligible for award. An "UNACCEPTABLE" rating, results in the technical quotation being rated "UNACCEPTABLE" unless corrected through discussions. An overall technical rating of "UNACCEPTABLE" makes a quotation ineligible for award.</p>

All quotations submitted with equivalent supplies shall provide a matrix that directly point back to all MEC's.</p>
<p>Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating	Description<br />Acceptable	Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the MECs and RFQ.<br />Unacceptable	Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the MECs and RFQ.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Price Offerors' price proposals will be evaluated to determine the price is fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 12.209. Quotations should include   a proposed price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.</p>
<p>(m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.

<p>(q) Other compliances. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this contract.</p>

<p>(s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) the schedule of supplies/services; (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other <br />Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause; (3) the clause at 52.212-5; (4) addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5) solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) other paragraphs of this clause; (7) the Standard Form 1449; (8) other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) the specification.</p>
<p>(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the <br />Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.</p>
<p>(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the <br />Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:</p>
<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.</p>
<p>(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any <br />Government authorized end user to such clause.</p>
<p>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>

<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>

OPAP IS AN INDEPENDENT REVIEWING AUTHORITY THAT IS EMPOWERED TO GRANT A PREVAILING PROTESTER ESSENTIALLY THE SAME RELIEF AS THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE (GAO).
<p>INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO SEEK RESOLUTION OF THEIR CONCERNS WITHIN THE USCG AS AN ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) FORUM RATHER THAN FILING A PROTEST WITH THE GAO OR SOME EXTERNAL FORUM. INTERESTED PARTIES MAY SEEK RESOLUTION OF THEIR CONCERNS INFORMALLY OR OPT TO FILE A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR OMBUDSMAN.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN.

IN ORDER TO ENSURE A TIMELY RESPONSE, INTERESTED PARTIES SHOULD PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION TO THE OMBUDSMAN: SOLICITATION/CONTRACT NUMBER, CONTRACTING OFFICE, CONTRACTING OFFICER, AND SOLICITATION CLOSING DATE (IF APPLICABLE).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. PRIOR TO SUBMITTING A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST, PROTESTERS MUST FIRST USE THEIR BEST EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THEIR CONCERNS WITH THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THROUGH OPEN AND FRANK DISCUSSIONS. IF THE PROTESTER'S CONCERNS ARE UNRESOLVED, AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW IS AVAILABLE BY THE OMBUDSMAN. THE PROTESTER MAY FILE A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST TO EITHER THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT, THE OMBUDSMAN UNDER THE OPAP PROGRAM. CONTRACT AWARD OR PERFORMANCE WILL BE SUSPENDED DURING THE PROTEST PERIOD UNLESS CONTRACT AWARD OR PERFORMANCE IS JUSTIFIED, IN WRITING, FOR URGENT AND COMPELLING REASONS OR IS DETERMINED IN WRITING TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE AGENCY'S GOAL IS TO RESOLVE PROTESTS IN LESS THAN 35 CALENDAR DAYS FROM THE DATE OF FILING. PROTESTS SHALL INCLUDE THE INFORMATION SET FORTH IN FAR 33.103(D) (2). IF THE PROTESTER FAILS TO SUBMIT THE REQUIRED INFORMATION, RESOLUTION OF THE PROTEST MAY BE DELAYED OR THE PROTEST MAY BE DISMISSED. TO BE TIMELY PROTESTS MUST BE FILED WITHIN THE PERIOD SPECIFIED IN FAR 33.103(E). FORMAL PROTESTS FILED UNDER THE OPAP PROGRAM SHOULD BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY TO OPAP@USCG.MIL AND THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR BY HAND DELIVERY TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Program Manager is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: Afghanistan/Pakistan (AF/PAK), Eurasia and Asia (E&amp;A), Middle East (ME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). OTI's regional teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.  OTI/Washington staff provides administrative and programmatic support for OTI programs in close coordination with field staff.</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the administration and management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of the time on country program implementation support, and approximately 20% of the time supporting strategic planning and program development. The Program Manager must have a strong interest in assisting countries in transition and be able to accomplish a wide range of administrative functions (budget and financial preparation and management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change. The successful candidate will demonstrate sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills, and possess a well-developed understanding of US policy interests.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The program office now anticipates an RFP release in late December 2016 to ensure the release of a well-defined RFP. <br /><br />The Program's aim to refine RFP language stems from its participation as a pilot program for the U.S. Air Force's Bending the Cost Curve (BTCC) initiative. The BTCC initiative seeks to increase competition and find solutions that work for both the U.S. Air Force and industry. Program activities to refine RFP language, including extensive dialogue with industry, have taken longer than initially anticipated to complete. <br /><br />In order to align the production schedule with the Air Force strategic planning, the program's Full Operational Capability has been adjusted from Fiscal Year (FY) 2032 to FY34. It is important to note: the initial Operational Capability date remains FY 24. <br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">09 March 2016:<br /><br /></span></strong>1.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Program Manager is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: Afghanistan/Pakistan (AF/PAK), Eurasia and Asia (E&amp;A), Middle East (ME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). OTI's regional teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.  OTI/Washington staff provides administrative and programmatic support for OTI programs in close coordination with field staff.</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the administration and management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of the time on country program implementation support, and approximately 20% of the time supporting strategic planning and program development. The Program Manager must have a strong interest in assisting countries in transition and be able to accomplish a wide range of administrative functions (budget and financial preparation and management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change. The successful candidate will demonstrate sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills, and possess a well-developed understanding of US policy interests.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.

The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Advanced Cyber, SIGINT and Personal Communications Collection and Exploitation</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA AFRL-RIK-2015-0022</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p><strong>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this BAA is to provide Science and Technology (S&amp;T) solutions to critical Air Force and Department of Defense (DoD) warfighter needs in Command, Control, Communications, Cyber, and Intelligence (C4I) capabilities with critical focus on Intelligence and Cyber. These solutions must be directly responsive to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Information Directorate strategic goals. The Information Directorate is the AFRL technical leader in Processing and Exploitation and Cyber Science technology with the mission to provide game-changing options to the warfighters that are both innovative and affordable. The breadth of the technology timeline includes both quick reaction capabilities to critical near term shortfalls to proof-of-concept for here-to-fore undemonstrated technical capabilities. To support these goals, this BAA seeks to solicit white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to further increase AFRL's knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required to (1) research and develop advanced Cyber and SIGnals INTelligence (SIGINT) communications collection techniques, and (2) support and develop systems that perform these operations. Solutions to engineering problems using innovative approaches are sought. <strong>We are not looking for point solutions, but rather solutions which are focused on versatile multi-agency systems that rely on an open architecture with scalable technologies.</strong></p>
<p>The overall technical objective of the BAA is two-fold.</p>
<p>The first component of the objective is to research unique and innovative techniques and algorithms that provide the identification, collection, processing, exploitation and/or manipulation of electronic communication signals in a moderate to dense co-channel environment with potentially significant Doppler effects. The Government is interested in: (1) Developing methods for the detection, identification, characterization, and geolocation of emerging communications and low radiated power level signals of interest; (2) Advancing digital signal processing software methodologies to provide new and existing systems and waveforms; (3) Developing new and innovative software and hardware architectures for standoff collection systems; (4) Developing and integrating these capabilities into information operations and collection systems; and (5) Developing the ability to characterize cognitive, software-defined radios from either airborne or ground-based platforms operating in dense signal environments.</p>
<p>The second component of the objective is to develop the Air Force's capabilities in the areas of digital signal processing (DSP) and cyber operations by leveraging existing technology developed by academia and industry as well as from other organizations. The Government is interested in the research and development of technologies to maximize the information which can be extracted from the data and signals for transition and integration into to the warfighter battle management and target material plans. Automated signal processing is a key component for net-centric warfare. The scope of this component is to analyze research, develop, and demonstrate new here-to-fore un-fielded cyber-capabilities. This will include augmenting and modifying existing fielded systems, incorporating the cyber-capabilities gleaned into the tactical target materials battle planning, discovering and improving novel capabilities on commercial and personal communications platforms, developing an automated government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) signal processing framework that provides rapid signal processing and cyber operations capabilities to enable the warfighter to respond in near real-time to threats in hostile areas of operation; and research and development into novel cyber operations techniques.</p>
<p>Detailed focus areas are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Detection and identification of signals of interest in dense signal environments, <br />2. Technologies that will enable SIGINT systems and/or platforms with an improved ability to automatically detect, identify, sort, track, prioritize, reliably classify, and geolocate target signals of interest, <br />3. Technology that will enable precise geolocation (weapon system accuracies) of emitters that are below the level of interference is of particular interest, <br />4. Interference cancellation techniques including beamforming and digital and temporal interference cancellation techniques that work on a single and/or array antennas,<br />5. Techniques that utilize the latest technology and emerging processor architectures as well as apply systems engineering approaches to platform integration, existing asset sharing, signal processing paths hardware constraints and reducing size, weight and power. Critical to this work is: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Developing signal reconstruction and signal identification techniques for emerging radio communication devices for emerging military and commercial radio communications, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Developing systems for embedding in Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP)-constrained platforms,<br />6. Information Operations (IO) systems consisting of the integrated application of electronic warfare operations (EW Ops), network warfare operations (NW Ops) and influence operations (IFO), and <br />7. Cyber operations addressing three major elements: Acquisition, Access and Processing (AAP) across the many new attack surfaces brought to play by the modern personnel communications available.</p>
<p>The innovative techniques and capabilities described in this BAA play a vital role in capturing measure of performance (MOP) and measure of effectiveness (MOE) indicators which are crucial for information operations. Information furnished from the intelligence gathering and processing technologies provides the continuous decision-quality information necessary to successfully employ air, space and information operations. Integration of these techniques into information operations systems and the timely incorporation into the battle planning process is of high interest.</p>

<p><strong>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">descending order of importance</span>, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The potential contributions of the effort to the Rome Research Site, Information Directorate mission and the extent to which the proposed effort will contribute to balancing the overall research and development program of AFRL, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any.</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA with a common cutoff date for multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>4. FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS: The Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) over the period of performance. An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered. The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR &sect; 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and per FAR 9.104-6 FAPIIS.</p>
<p><strong>VI. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO</span> INFORMATION - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</strong></p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>For additional information, a copy of the AFRL "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry," Mar 2015, and Proposal Preparation Instructions, Dec 2014, may be accessed at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d<br />&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET/SCI information at the time of award.

<SOLNBR>RP21-RFI
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>113016
<CONTACT>Charles M. Dodson, Phone 6612779601, Email charles.dodson@us.af.mil
<DESC>*Please note change in due date*<br /><br />This is not a Request for Proposal but is an RFI only. The Rocket Propulsion for the 21st Century (RP21) program is a DoD/NASA/Industry coordinated effort to develop revolutionary and innovative rocket propulsion technologies by the year 2027 pursuing a 3x approach for improving rocket propulsion capabilities. The program is structured in two phases, with nominal completion dates by calendar years 2017 and 2027.
<p>The Government is interested in obtaining information from U.S. Rocket Propulsion companies in the form of ARPPs regarding how future goals for the RP21 program may be met. The information provided in the ARPPs will be used to; 1) enable the government to provide detailed feedback to the contractors regarding their approach for achieving RP21 goals and 2) revise Government Rocket Propulsion Plans (GRPPs). Updated GRPPs aid in requirements definition for future Government science and technology (S&amp;T) projects and procurements. United States (U.S.) Rocket Propulsion companies who participate in RP21 will develop (or team with other U.S. companies to develop) an ARPP. A Government led team comprised of DoD and NASA representatives will review the ARPPs submitted by the U.S. Rocket Propulsion companies and provide feedback identifying strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>The propulsion application areas of interest are Boost and Orbit Transfer Propulsion (including propulsion efforts of Technology for the Sustainment of Strategic Systems (TSSS) IPT for ICBMs and SLBMs), Spacecraft Propulsion, and Tactical Propulsion. The baseline data and goal summary information is included in the RP21 RFI supplemental package for these mission application areas. Only companies registered with the U.S./CANADA JOINT CERTIFICATION OFFICE, Defense Logistics Agency (detailed information below) will be provided the RP21 RFI supplemental package.</p>
<p>The ARPP shall describe in detail the contractor's plan for full achievement of all the time-phased goals for each proposed propulsion system type within an application area. The contractor may provide plans in one or more application areas, but must address all goals and phases within any proposed application area for the type of propulsion system being addressed. New and innovative concepts, materials, and processes are encouraged. It is the intent of the government to issue a call for ARPPs on a biannual basis.</p>
<p>The government will provide written comments to each contractor specifically in the following areas. Does the ARPP address all the RP21 goals within all the phases of the selected mission application area(s)? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the plan? Is this a viable plan and do the projects integrate together toward a demonstration of simultaneous goal achievement? Does the ARPP contain all the information requested in the RFI and Supplemental Package? Is the ARPP clear, concise and well organized? Reviews of the ARPPs will be scheduled to make best use of electronic communications of the respective government and industry participants to be cost effective while choosing the best methods to meet the objective.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing existing RP21 goals, if a company would like to have changes to the existing RP21 goal set considered, please provide the recommended goal changes in detail with supporting justification information as part of the ARPP. These details should include the rationale for the proposed change, new or modified propulsion-specific numeric technology goal(s), component-specific numeric technical objectives linked to technical challenges and approaches to achieve the goals, along with quantified potential system payoffs for achieving the stated goal.</p>
<p>We request companies send copies of their ARPP to each of the principle government organizations participating in the review. They are listed as follows with the preferred number of copies, addressee and address. Please send eight computer disk (CD) copies of each response to Mr. Drew DeGeorge, AFRL/RQR, 5 Pollux Drive, Building 8353, Room 227B, Edwards AFB CA 93524-7048.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) plans to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) to repair the Research Aircraft Hangar B4802 HVAC system located at Edward Air Force Base, Edwards, CA.
<p><br />The purpose of the project is to address the ailing mechanical systems inside Hangar B4802. This project will include the repair-by-replacement of the hangar's evaporative cooling system with the additive option to install radiant heating. The evaporative cooling units are to be demolished and replaced. The existing ductwork will be reused and repaired. Some of the cooling units are located on steel elevated platforms, which will be demolished as well. The demolished systems will be replaced by a new system capable of providing adequate cooling to the hangar, as required. The existing radiant-slab heating system is to be abandoned in place due to it no longer being cost efficient to run, given its age and frequency of burst pipes if radiant heater option is exercised. A new heating system is to be designed and installed to provide adequate heating as necessitated by the hangar as an option. The exhaust system will be redesigned to be functional with new cooling system. All of these systems shall then be integrated to the building's existing building automation system (BAS). This project will not increase AFRC's square footage.</p>
<p>The order of magnitude for the procurement is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 and the effort shall be completed within 360 calendar days after notice to proceed.</p>

<DESC>1.  This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Policy  3.2.1.2.1.  Interested parties are advised that: 
- This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposals;
- The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals;
- The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses; and
- Any costs associated with your response are solely at the interested parties expense.   

2.  Description of the Required Services
Navigation Technical Assistance Contract
The Federal Aviation Administration is in the process of modernizing the National Airspace System (NAS) to meet the needs of the 21st Century.  Inherent in this mission is the requirement to provide a safe, cost-effective, navigation and timing service. Currently, navigation requirements are largely met with legacy, ground-based navigation, and lighting systems.  FAA has committed to evolving the NAS to Performance Based Navigation (PBN).  During this lengthy transition, FAA has a requirement to support both legacy and modernized navigation systems.  

Through the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), FAA is addressing the impact of air traffic growth by increasing capacity and efficiency while improving safety, reducing environmental impacts, and increasing user access to the National Airspace System (NAS).  PBN is an essential element of the NextGen plan to modernize the NAS.  To achieve NextGen goals, FAA is implementing new PBN routes and procedures that leverage emerging space-based technologies and enhanced aircraft navigation capabilities.  

The NAVTAC II support Contractor will assist the Navigation Programs Group and Performance Based Navigation Offices in their joint mission to provide safe, cost-effective position, navigation, and timing services to meet the operational needs of current and future aviation customers that operate in the NAS.   The FAA Navigation Programs Group and the PBN Office have a need for professional services covering areas such as engineering support, logistics, software integration and maintenance, training, operations research and analysis, requirements development and analysis, and business and material management. Examples include technical support services to assist in the planning, research, development, engineering, implementation, sustainment, and decommissioning of various navigation, landing, and lighting systems, as well as support for the PBN Instrument Flight Procedure (IFP) process. 

3.  The FAA intends to use FAA and contractor support staff in reviewing and evaluating any responses to this announcement and will ensure that the appropriate organizational conflict of interest and nondisclosure agreements are signed prior to any review.

4.  Copies of the NAVTAC II Industry Day Presentation and Attendee List have been uploaded for review.

5.  All SIR Sections below are currently in draft status and subject to revisions and final approval.

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), NAS Patuxent River, MD, intends to negotiate and award an Advance Acquisition Contract (AAC) for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) 3 in Fiscal Year (FY)17 and a fixed price type contract for LRIP 3 in FY18 to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGC), San Diego, CA, on a sole-source basis to procure the MQ-4C Triton Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) (formerly known as Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAS) and related supplies and services. <br /><br />The LRIP 3 AAC will procure long lead items (e.g., components, material, parts, and associated efforts) required to maintain the planned production schedules. The LRIP 3 contract will include up to three aircraft, one main operating base, one forward operating base, trade studies, mission control systems, non-recurring engineering costs (e.g., parts obsolescence engineering and productionization), engineering change orders, integrated logistics support (ILS), interim contractor support, trainers, and support equipment.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(C)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only one Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements" for the proposed action for LRIP 3 and 4. NGC is the sole designer and developer of the MQ-4C Triton UAS. This contract is a follow-on contract for the production of a major system and award to any other source other than NGC would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement. The Government will consider all information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract actions based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing via e-mail to the attention of Jacob Leitch or Justin Francis using the contact information provided in the synopsis. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation: Ms. Vicky Harper-Hall, Socio-Economic Programs Sector Manager, e-mail: Vicky.harper-hall@ngc.com or phone (301) 331-3824.</p>

<DESC>***THIS NOTICE CONSTITUES THE SOLICITATION ***
<p>Offerors must possess a TOP SECRET Facility Clearance with safeguarding at the SECRET level. The Performance Work Statement (PWS) for this requirement is CLASSIFIED.<br /><br />SECRET safeguarding is required by the Department in order for prospective offerors to obtain the classified work statement (which comprises Section C of the solicitation and which contains information necessary for offerors to provide an acceptable proposal notwithstanding the fact that the proposal itself will be unclassified) as well as in order for the awarded contractor to be able to retain and access that work statement as part of its awarded contract.</p>
<p>In order to obtain the PWS document, offerors must email their intent (indicating their DUNS number and CAGE code) to retrieve the PWS via email to Michael Henderson (<a href="mailto:HendersonMP@state.gov">HendersonMP@state.gov</a>) and Steven Haines (<a href="mailto:HainesSG@state.gov">HainesSG@state.gov</a>) by 1:00pm on Monday July 11 2016. IMPORTANT: The email must contain both the offeror's DUNS number and CAGE Code.</p>
<p>In addition, offerors shall follow the instructions laid out in Attachment 1 - Bidder's DD254 by confirming their clearance status with the Department of State's Industrial Security Division (DS/IS/IND) via ISFD notification and send a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via email to DSINDDOMESTICTEAM@state.gov addressed to Mr. Mike Hawk, Department of State (DoS), DS/IS/IND, Washington D.C. 20520, with Cc to Ms. Denise Wilson (<a href="mailto:WilsonD@state.gov">WilsonD@state.gov</a>) and Garry Willis (<a href="mailto:WillisG@state.gov">WillisG@state.gov</a>). This must also be completed by 1:00pm Monday July 11 2016.</p>
<p>After all vendor's clearance status has been verified by DS/IS/IND, the government will schedule the day where physical copies of the PWS will be made available for pick up. All vendors that have been verified will receive an email with regards to when and where the PWS will be made available. Failure to appear and retrieve the PWS on the date specified will result in the offeror not obtaining the PWS and thus being ineligible for award consideration.</p>
<p>***OFFERORS MAY NOT CREATE OR DERIVE ANY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION FROM THE PWS FOR USE IN THEIR RESPONSE TO THE RFP/SOLICITATION***</p>
<p>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE REFER TO THE BIDDER'S DD254 ATTACHED TO THIS NOTICE.</p>

<DESC>Space and Naval Warfare System Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic has a requirement to provide professional engineering services in support of the Fixed Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (FVLF/LF) transmitter and antenna systems. The contractor will be required to provide engineering services on an on call basis to conduct analysis and to identify/implement solutions for the FVLF/LF transmitter and antenna system problems created by design deficiencies, equipment obsolesce or technical changes which have resulted in a degraded reliability or in less than optimum performance.
The FVLF/LF transmitting stations provide the primary broadcast communications link for the command and control of Strategic Submarine Ballistic Nuclear (SSBN) and Strategic Submarine Nuclear (SSN) submarines making it part of the Nuclear Command and Control Communications (NC3) architecture. Those stations were designed and constructed at various times over the past six decades.  Consequently, each is unique and all are subject to problems peculiar to particular stations requiring the employment of consultants well versed in highly specialized areas of FVLF/LF transmitter, antenna, and antenna network theoretical and applications engineering. Timely solution to problems as they develop is necessary to ensure reliable communications to fleet commanders in command and control of submarines.

<DESC>This order is the result of&nbsp;a competitively awarded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract. This order was awarded to Amelex as both cost-plus-fixed-fee and cost reimbursement. Fixed-price was not selected for this effort as the operations covered in the performance based requirements can change for labor, material and travel needs. These changes cause an inability to accurately forecast costs. Work performed under this order shall include engineering services to support various Aircraft Traffic Control &amp; Landing System (ATC&amp;LS) Upgrade Programs. The ATC&amp;LS Upgrade Programs provide production, modification, and modernization to the current in-production ATC&amp;LSs.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY
 
	
1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition Operations
      Technology Acquisition Center
      23 Christopher Way
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2.	Description of Action: This proposed action is for firm-fixed price delivery order to be issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for Flexera AdminStudio Enterprise software maintenance support.  

3.	Description of Supplies or Services: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Information Technology (OI&T), Enterprise Systems Engineering (ESE) has a requirement to renew maintenance on 12 Flexera AdminStudio Enterprise licenses. The required Flexera AdminStudio Enterprise software maintenance with Virtualization Pack (Silver), Part No. KSAVDK1, will include automatic notification of and access to all product updates and upgrades, security patches/updates, technical webinars, white papers, and unlimited access to technical support, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The period of performance for the software maintenance will be 12-months from date of award.  

4.	Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C 4106(c)(2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled, "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited: Based on extensive market research, as described in Section 8 of this justification, it was determined that limited competition is available among authorized resellers for the required brand name Flexera AdminStudio software maintenance support services.  Flexera AdminStudio provides a robust, intuitive means to package software and un-package/re-package that software for remote delivery. The current implementation ensures the proper delivery of software to targeted machines used throughout the Microsoft Systems Center Configuration Manager by ESE, and tracks all the software changes at every step in the Change and Release Management Process.  Unlike other technologies, Flexera is fully compatible with all VA supported workstations and laptops located within the offices of ESE.  The software maintenance is needed to ensure the existing software implementation remains fully operational.  The Flexera software communicates through a source code that is based on Flexera proprietary data.  Therefore, if any other source was to provide these maintenance services without the Flexera proprietary source code, it would not be able to push upgrades to the existing software or fix, and configure the software.  Access to the proprietary source code is critical to meet the VA's need to maintain the current Flexera software as operational.  Based on the market research conducted by the Government technical experts it has been determined only Flexera or its authorized resellers have the required access to the source code of the software to be able to meet the Governments' needs.   

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in Section 8 of this justification. Limited competition is anticipated for this brand name software maintenance support.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will not be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website due to the dollar threshold.  In accordance with Far 16.505 (a)(4)(ii)(A), this justification will be submitted to all applicable NASA SEWP V GWAC holders along with the Request for Quotation in order to fully notify all interested parties.  

7.	Actions to Increase Competition: The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the marketplace that would enable future actions to be fully competed. 

8.	Market Research: Flexera AdminStudio Enterprise maintenance is a commercially available off-the-shelf software license package currently in use in VA.  When conducting market research in July 2016, the Government's technical experts reviewed similar software products to ascertain if these items could meet VA's requirements.  Specifically, the Government's technical experts conducted web-based research on similar software maintenance products available. Based on reviews, the Government's technical experts determined that no other software maintenance can meet the Government's interoperability and compatibility requirements for the existing VA-owned Flexera software system because of Flexera's proprietary source code.

The TAC conducted additional market research in July 2016 and again in September 2016 by utilizing the Provider Lookup Tool on the NASA SEWP V GWAC website, which found a total of 40 contract holders that can fulfill the Governments requirements, nine of which are Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) GWAC contract holders.  Furthermore, market research was conducted on Vendor Information Page (VIP.gov) which found that two or more VIP verified vendors are capable of meeting requirements.  Additionally, NASA SEWP V GWAC has a dynamic catalog where line items can be added based on customer requests, therefore, as long as the required item or service is within scope of the NASA SEWP V GWACs, items and services can be added to a NASA SEWP V GWAC holder's catalog on a daily basis.  In addition, the requirements discussed herein have been found to be within scope of the NASA SEWP V GWAC in a separate determination. 

9.  Other Facts: None.

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE:   10/1/2016	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
As manufacturer of the equipment, GE Healthcare is uniquely qualified to maintain the systems with manufacturer trained service technicians, and access to all original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts for all required maintenance services.	
     	

1	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is: (If FAR 8.405-6(a) (2) iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	
Due to the proprietary nature of the operating software, and the maintenance passwords required to repair these systems, the manufacturer is the only reliable option.	 Additionally, the manufacturer is under 
an ID/IQ contract with the VA National Acquisition Center for these services - V797P-6019B.  Proprietary statement is attached.  	
     	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
As manufacturer of the equipment, GE Healthcare has immediate access to all parts and software necessary to keep the equipment under this contract operating at full capacity with minimal downtime.	
     	

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
	
(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
GE Healthcare parts and labor costs are comparable to previous orders with them. The previous service contract for GE imaging equipment was $853,118.00. Pricing has a tendency to slowly increase over time. However, the estimated cost for another service contract to cover the same equipment this year is $852,368.00. This is slightly lower than the previous year. In conclusion, we believe GE Healthcare provides the best value in meeting the requirements of this request. In accordance with FAR 8.404(d) the price was already determined to be fair and reasonable by GSA. Any additional discounts will be sought at the time of award.	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market research was conducted with the VA National Acquisition Center and GE Healthcare.  The determination is that GE Healthcare is the best option for the service under the VA NAC contract V797P-6019B.  Additional an intent to sole source notice was posted to FBO under RFI VA247-16-N-0909              on 30 July 2106 with no potential offeror's indicating an interest in this requirement.  	
     	

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
The equipment systems in this contract are used daily in providing critical patient care.  The potential for downtime can cause procedures to be rescheduled which are costly to the medical center if sent out as fee-basis and can increase the amount of time before our patients are served.  The services for GI Imaging is only available from GE Healthcare and is under VA FSS contract V797P-6019B.	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
Review of the market will be made before processing each action to ensure no additional provides are  overlooked or eliminated from competition. The equipment systems in this contract are used daily in providing critical patient care.  The potential for downtime can cause procedures to be rescheduled which are costly to the medical center if sent out as fee-basis and can increase the amount of time before our patients are served.	

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor's supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)

Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA251-16-AP-4323

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service.  (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor:   Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic   	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:    866-323-3468   	
Mfgr/Contractor Address:   115 Norwood Park St., Norwood, MA 02062-4633  	
Dealer/Rep address/phone number: Cathy Knutsen	

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	1900 E. Main St. 	___________
		Danville, IL 61832_________________
	     	
	     	
                                                                          VISN:	12	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
Purchase of reagents and supplies for cost per reportable lab testing on Siemens Centaur instrument (V797D-30175) from a single source.	
     	
     	


(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
  Siemens analyzer required supplies and reagents (FT4 Reagent/250, T3 Reagent/400, FSH Reagent/500, IPTH Reagent/100, etc.)  	

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $260,000.00	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:    10/01/2016 - 09/30/2017    	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

0	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	
	
     	
     	
     	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
     	
  Siemens Centaur XP instrument is currently being used and is within its useful life. The only reagents that can be used with this instrument are Siemens reagents specified by the manufacturer. These are also the only approved reagents per FDA. The need for these reagents constitutes a proprietary sole/limited source situation and any attempt to vary from these reagents for use with this instrument would taint results and jeopardize patient care.   	
     	
     	
     	

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

 (5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
     	
In accordance with FAR 8.4, this order represents the best value to the Government because it provides the only source to utilize the existing Siemens equipment in providing continuous VA patient care.	
     	
     	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
     	
Market research was conducted on GSA, NAC and the internet. There is currently no other vendors  who have access to the proprietary reagents and are able to provide these specific supplies which are needed for lab testing. I also contacted the vendor directly to see if they have two SDVOSB distributors and at this time they do not. 	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
     	
None	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
     	
 Once the VA Medical Center determines our current analyzer is deemed unserviceable or outdated, we will look for future competition for replacement equipment as well as the reagents that need to run on this equipment. Abrupt replacement for this equipment is not possible due to 2-3 months of transition needed to conduct proper reference testing and quality control measures. This transition period and requirement must be taken into account when proposing future replacement of these machines.    	
     	
     	

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor's supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(X)  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5 (b)(6);
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

FAR13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items:  The authority for applying the Simplified Procedures for Commercial Items of  FAR 13.5 is 41 U.S.C. 1901 and is implemented by for restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). 

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  In Accordance with the Veterans First Contracting Program and the Authority under 38 USC 8127-8128 (Sections 502 and 503 of Public Law ((P.L.) 109-461), FAR Part 6.302-5(b)(6), and VAAR 819.7007, the Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract to a SDVOSB.  L1 Enterprises is a CVE verified SDVOSB able to supply all the required equipment.      
The required items are a direct replacement of current Karl Storz equipment and must be compatible and interact with the current Karl Storz infrastructure currently in use.  Since 2010 the Salt Lake VAMC has built the current Karl Storz infrastructure by purchasing Karl Storz monitors and other equipment and software.  Salt Lake VAMC has purchased the Karl Storz infrastructure on purchase order numbers: VA660-A00085, VA259-12-P-8585, VA259-13-F-2409, VA259-13-F-0707, VA259-14-F-0016, VA259-14-F-0638, VA259-15-F-3272, and VA259-16-F-1659.  In order for the new equipment to work with/interface with the current Karl Storz infrastructure Karl Storz digital imaging equipment must be procured.  Purchasing non-Karl Storz digital imaging equipment and components would require the entire infrastructure to be replaced which would result in the substantial duplication of cost that could not be recovered by the VA through competition.  Karl Storz was contacted about the use of other equipment brands with the Karl Storz equipment and infrastructure and the company representative replied their system is proprietary.  The products are FDA registered devices thus requiring only the use of tested and validated components.  

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Sources sought notices were placed on SEWP, GSA eBuy, and FBO.  The SEWP sources sought returned one SDVOSB distributor declining the possibility to provide a quote.  eBuy returned no responses.  The FBO posting returned three responses.  One response was from a SDVOSB declining the opportunity to provide a future quote; a second SDVOSB distributor is interested in providing a quote; and the large manufacturer is interested in providing a quote.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated cost will be determined fair and reasonable by evaluating the quoted price against open market prices and past purchases.  Similar Karl Storz equipment was purchased in the past for VISN 19 medical centers.  The most recent similar purchase was for Karl Storz monitors for two ORs at the Salt Lake Medical Center in February 2016.  These past prices will be used to determine price fair and reasonable in conjunction with open market prices charged by the manufacturer. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was conducted using multiple sources.  The VetBiz website was searched using NAICS Code 334510, which resulted in 79 vendors, when adding the key words "Karl Storz", one vendor, a SDVOSB distributor, remained.  A search was conducted on the SBA Dynamic Search page using NAICS Code 334510, which resulted in 1,295 vendors.  In the few capability narratives some of the stated capabilities didn't match the VA's needs.  Sources sought notices were posted on NASA SEWP, GSA eBuy and FBO.  One response was received from a SEWP vendor stating they will not provide a quote.  GSA eBuy sources sought produced no results.  FBO sources sought produced three results; the first was from a SDVOSB stating they wouldn't provide a quote, the second was the large business manufacturer (Karl Storz), and the third was the manufacturer's SDVOSB partner/distributor (L1 Enterprises).  Both companies stated they could provide a quote.  In addition to the sources sought notices, an email was sent out to some small businesses found during the VetBiz and SBA searches; the emails included the GSA eBuy and FBO sources sought information.   

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Karl Storz was contacted about the use of other brands with the Karl Storz infrastructure and the company representative replied their infrastructure system is proprietary.  The products are FDA registered devices thus requiring only the use of tested and validated components.  The Karl Storz infrastructure and digital imaging devices require the use of other tools such as the Da Vinci Robot and Sony printer.  Karl Storz doesn't manufacture the tools, but has created kits to integrate them and has tested and validate the use of these tools with their system.  Karl Storz doesn't have a kit to allow other digital imaging devices to use their infrastructure.  In addition, the proposed SDVOSB vendor, L1 Enterprises, is providing a credit back to the Government for the "trade-in" of existing Karl Storz equipment being used.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
"	L1 Enterprises, Inc.
o	SDVOSB
o	distributor
"	Karl Storz Endoscopy-America, Inc. 
o	Large
o	manufacturer

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  For future requirements market research will be performed using vip.vetbiz.gov, FPDS, GSA eBuy, FBO, and eCMS.  Additionally, the required equipment will be re-evaluated to determine if the current equipment and infrastructure is still proprietary to Karl Storz or if other systems can integrate.

FAR13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items:  The authority for applying the Simplified Procedures for Commercial Items of  FAR 13.5 is 41 U.S.C. 1901 and is implemented by for restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). 

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  In Accordance with the Veterans First Contracting Program and the Authority under 38 USC 8127-8128 (Sections 502 and 503 of Public Law ((P.L.) 109-461), FAR Part 6.302-5(b)(6), and VAAR 819.7007, the Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract to a SDVOSB.  L1 Enterprises is a CVE verified SDVOSB able to supply all the required equipment.      
The required items are a direct replacement of current Karl Storz equipment and must be compatible and interact with the current Karl Storz infrastructure currently in use.  Since 2010 the Salt Lake VAMC has built the current Karl Storz infrastructure by purchasing Karl Storz monitors and other equipment and software.  Salt Lake VAMC has purchased the Karl Storz infrastructure on purchase order numbers: VA660-A00085, VA259-12-P-8585, VA259-13-F-2409, VA259-13-F-0707, VA259-14-F-0016, VA259-14-F-0638, VA259-15-F-3272, and VA259-16-F-1659.  In order for the new equipment to work with/interface with the current Karl Storz infrastructure Karl Storz digital imaging equipment must be procured.  Purchasing non-Karl Storz digital imaging equipment and components would require the entire infrastructure to be replaced which would result in the substantial duplication of cost that could not be recovered by the VA through competition.  Karl Storz was contacted about the use of other equipment brands with the Karl Storz equipment and infrastructure and the company representative replied their system is proprietary.  The products are FDA registered devices thus requiring only the use of tested and validated components.  

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Sources sought notices were placed on SEWP, GSA eBuy, and FBO.  The SEWP sources sought returned one SDVOSB distributor declining the possibility to provide a quote.  eBuy returned no responses.  The FBO posting returned three responses.  One response was from a SDVOSB declining the opportunity to provide a future quote; a second SDVOSB distributor is interested in providing a quote; and the large manufacturer is interested in providing a quote.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated cost will be determined fair and reasonable by evaluating the quoted price against open market prices and past purchases.  Similar Karl Storz equipment was purchased in the past for VISN 19 medical centers.  The most recent similar purchase was for Karl Storz monitors for two ORs at the Salt Lake Medical Center in February 2016.  These past prices will be used to determine price fair and reasonable in conjunction with open market prices charged by the manufacturer. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research was conducted using multiple sources.  The VetBiz website was searched using NAICS Code 334510, which resulted in 79 vendors, when adding the key words "Karl Storz", one vendor, a SDVOSB distributor, remained.  A search was conducted on the SBA Dynamic Search page using NAICS Code 334510, which resulted in 1,295 vendors.  In the few capability narratives some of the stated capabilities didn't match the VA's needs.  Sources sought notices were posted on NASA SEWP, GSA eBuy and FBO.  One response was received from a SEWP vendor stating they will not provide a quote.  GSA eBuy sources sought produced no results.  FBO sources sought produced three results; the first was from a SDVOSB stating they wouldn't provide a quote, the second was the large business manufacturer (Karl Storz), and the third was the manufacturer's SDVOSB partner/distributor (L1 Enterprises).  Both companies stated they could provide a quote.  In addition to the sources sought notices, an email was sent out to some small businesses found during the VetBiz and SBA searches; the emails included the GSA eBuy and FBO sources sought information.   

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Karl Storz was contacted about the use of other brands with the Karl Storz infrastructure and the company representative replied their infrastructure system is proprietary.  The products are FDA registered devices thus requiring only the use of tested and validated components.  The Karl Storz infrastructure and digital imaging devices require the use of other tools such as the Da Vinci Robot and Sony printer.  Karl Storz doesn't manufacture the tools, but has created kits to integrate them and has tested and validate the use of these tools with their system.  Karl Storz doesn't have a kit to allow other digital imaging devices to use their infrastructure.  In addition, the proposed SDVOSB vendor, L1 Enterprises, is providing a credit back to the Government for the "trade-in" of existing Karl Storz equipment being used.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  For future requirements market research will be performed using vip.vetbiz.gov, FPDS, GSA eBuy, FBO, and eCMS.  Additionally, the required equipment will be re-evaluated to determine if the current equipment and infrastructure is still proprietary to Karl Storz or if other systems can integrate.
