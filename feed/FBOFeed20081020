<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (ED) intends to enter into a sole source blanket purchase agreement (BPA) with Silent Partners Security Systems, Inc., located in Marshall, Virginia, for maintenance, upgrading, and expansion of existing installed systems and equipment. The anticipated BPA does not allow for replacement of the existing infrastructure.  In addition, the existing system is a DSX system, which is proprietary in nature and will require the support contractor be a licensed DSX system support provider. 

The selection of the installation and maintenance contractor for the Access Control System (DSX) will be based on the following criteria: 

-     Maintenance, upgrade and expansion (i.e. expansion to additional ED facilities throughout the continental United States and Puerto Rico) of the current Access Control System in place at twenty-one ED locations throughout the United States.  This contract is specific for support of the current Access Control System.  The support, new installations, expansion and any upgrade to the existing access control components includes the following elements:
-     Maintenance of DSX system infrastructure through authorized licensed agreement with DSX, Inc. 
-     Level of protection the systems provide;
-     Initial cost and annual maintenance cost to the Government;
-     Must be a Sequel based Windows platform;
-     Ability to network, control, input information, and manage the system from the existing central location within the ED Headquarters’ (HQ) facility and supporting continuity locations and disaster recovery sites;
-     Full compatibility with the Federal Governments Current HSPD-12/PIV ID Directives;
-     Must utilize all existing access control and CCTV devices and panels in the HQ, Washington, DC and regional facilities;

-     System must include a twenty-four hour, seven days per week (24/7) service support with a minimum of six -hour response time;
-     Ability to provide visual validation of cardholders at user defined workstations and turnstile devices. 

Current and Future Requirements

ED relocates approximately three to four facilities annually based on the lease expiration dates, square footage requirements, budget constraints, and consolidation needs of the Department.  As facility leases expire, the determination of whether to relocate or to extend the present lease will be determined. Security systems for these locations must be 100% compatible with the existing DSX systems for proper monitoring and access control. The Departments goal is to install compatible access control systems and equipment into all future facilities as deemed necessary by HSPD-12, The Departments Security Services and the Federal protective Services by means of threat assessment requirements and recommendations.

The responsibilities of the Access Control Software and Service Provider are as follows:

-     Provide the Department with written estimates for requested security equipment in existing and future ED facilities, 
-     Provide maintenance at an agreed amount for all supplied and installed equipment. Install new equipment into Department facilities and leased facilities at the request of the Department and Federal Protective Services (FPS). 

The contracted service provider will be solely responsible for the installation of identification systems; CCTV, stand alone alarm systems, and access control systems, with the exception of FPS installed and monitored alarm systems. The contracted service provider will be solely responsible for acquiring all permits and licenses for both new installation and systems upgrades as required by local code and facility agreements.

<DESC>The FAA, Great Lakes Region, intends to enter into a single source procurement with Evans Consoles to design and install a new console system for the Midway ATCT.  The existing consoles need to be reduced in depth, height and reconfigured to provide for new electronics equipment.  The FAA will work with the vendor to come up with a console design that will allow for CPU storage under the console including a slide out drawer to include cable management, allow for power conduits and grounding (by the FAA) and cab layout.  It is the FAA's intent to utilize the same concept from the O'Hare modernization project for the perimeter consoles and slatwall system.  Services under this contract will include development, coordination, planning, engineering, determination of compatibility with the current cab structure design, compatibility with the proposed electronics equipment, consideration of human factor criteria, prototype evaluation, cost estimating and installation.  The firm will be required to work in occupied space during low traffic hours of operation. Any interruption to Air Traffic operation will cause economic hardship for the airlines and a major inconvenience to the flying public.  The FAA cannot tolerate any unnecessary risk/accidental outage at this Airport.  The timing of this project must align with an ongoing electronics equipment replacement project at Midway.  The console replacement project will occur in a live, operational environment, and must be completed in four months or less.  Targeted completion date is currently August 2009.  Should a vendor believe they are capable of providing this requirement contact the Contracting Officer, Melody McGovern at 847/294-7347.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement to procure services to assemble two additional FOOFinjector utilizing existing, unfinished, spare hardware in the possession of the currentcontractor from an earlier phase of the project. This assemble shall include, if possiblethe injector assembly, chamber/nozzle, igniter and propellant valves.  Each assemblyshall include an acceptance data package when delivered to NASA.NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Aerojet of Sacramento, California as acontinuation under NASA Contract NNC06CB64C.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably availablefrom only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following 4 reasons:A.	The product is a unique, very complex rocket engine component and involvesproprietary processes, thus it would be impractical for another company to finish orbuild them.B.	Aerojet has already built and delivered several of the same components to NASA aspart of the base contract, which is an ongoing advanced development program. Forcontinuity of the development program, and for the test data from the new injectors to berelevant to the test data gathered to date on previous builds, the 2 additional injectorsmust be technically equivalent to those previously delivered by Aerojet, and tested inthe same manner at Aerojet's facility. C.	Because Aerojet has already partially manufactured key components, it would beunreasonable, and a poor business practice for NASA to direct Aerojet to release thecomponents to another manufacturer. D.	To award the additional work to any other source would result in substantialduplication of non-recurring engineering costs already paid to Aerojet by the government,and would jeopardize the relevance of the new injector's test data to the existingdatabase.  In addition, awarding to a new vendor would add unknown schedule and technicalrisks as a new vendor attempted to work through a learning curve.The intent of this approach is to be as cost effective as possible, and as timely aspossible, by completing fabrication using primarily existing spare parts, and personnelwho are already experienced with the fabrication and test processes. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon _November 7, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Fire Research Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with KTECH Corporation, Albuquerque, NM, for the purchase of Directional Flame Thermometers.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  In Fiscal Year 2008, NIST used Directional Flame Thermometers (DFT’s) from KTECH during proof of concept testing on a first generation deployable measurement system developed and tested successfully.  In Fiscal Year 2009, the second generation deployable measurement system will be used to quantify structure ignition in a variety of prescribed fires.  NIST requires additional DFT’s from KTECH which are needed for unique rapid response instrumentation developed in support of NIST-BFRL’s efforts to study ignition of structures in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) Fires.  All units must be identical to the current DFT’s to compare the heat flux measurements from a variety of fires using the same series of DFT’s.  Therefore, the additional DFT’s must be 100 percent compatible with the existing DFT’s in order to provide consistent results.  KTECH Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the DFT’s that are required to satisfy the Government’s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334511, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by November 5, 2008, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to award a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Delivery Order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-05-G-0017 on a sole source basis with ITT Avionics, Clifton, New Jersey.  This effort will include all labor and materials required to perform Risk Reduction efforts in support of an AN/ALQ-214 Engineering Change Proposal (ECP).  This ECP effort is intended to allow the ALQ-214 to meet the requirement for an Onboard Jammer (OBJ) to function on the F/A-18 C/D/E/F.   The ECP shall leverage upon recent developments in digital EW technologies applicable toward upgrading the existing ALQ-214 system and accelerated integration on the host Navy platforms.  

This effort shall build upon the current scope of the work being performed under the Risk Reduction Phase I effort (Delivery Order 0007 to BOA N00019-05-G-0017), to complete preliminary and detailed/final WRA and SRA hardware designs for the Receiver / Processor, Modulator, Transmitter and Rack WRAs, as well as associated preliminary software design efforts for the Built-In Test (BIT), Mission Data File Generator (MDFG), Receiver, Tracker and Technique Generator (TG) functions.  The Contractor shall conduct monthly Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) and one Hardware Critical Design Review (CDR) and Software Preliminary Design Review (PDR) to review the technical status and associated ECP design changes.  The Contractor shall report on each effort and related engineering investigations and may be required to prepare and submit “Engineering White Papers” for discussing trade-offs associated with proposed hardware or software changes.  

This action is being awarded on a sole source basis to ITT Avionics in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;” because they are the only qualified source which possesses the detailed knowledge of the AN/ALQ-214 design to allow them to perform these efforts in a timely and cost effective manner. Questions concerning subcontracting should be directed to Ms Kathleen Thornton of ITT Avionics at (973) 284-4014. See numbered notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NEXT GENERATION HELMET SENSOR SYNOPSIS<BR><BR>The U.S. Army RDECOM - Natick Contracting Division, in support of the US Army Soldier Systems Center-Natick has a requirement for 30,000 helmet sensors and accompanying data retrieval systems.  PEO Soldier has identified the need to produce and field the next generation helmet sensors to improve the sensors operational effectiveness for six brigade equivalents.  <BR><BR>The Helmet Sensor as a device will be coupled and integrated with a soldier helmet and will not present any harm to the individual soldier wearing the device nor interfere with any other helmet components or systems. This miniaturized device, when employed, will quantitatively measure rigid body motion responses associated with kinetic energy blasts and impact behavior. The device records and measures the magnitude and direction of both translational and angular accelerations. The device when operational and activated will discriminate between normal head motions and impacts observed in typical field activities, as well as discern high energy dynamic events when the helmet is exposed to ballistics impacts, blast pressures, and shock waves. The Helmet Sensor device will be an operationally multi-functional device fully capable of transmitting data captured either by means of using a wireless technique and/or via a standard computer USB module connection.

As part of an integrated strategy to provide veterans with timely access to quality health care services, VA healthcare facilities are authorized to pay for health care services acquired from non-VA health care providers. These services may be provided to eligible veterans from non-VA health care providers when VA determines medically necessary services are not available from VA on a timely basis, in an emergency or when VA or other Federal facilities are not feasibly available. VA manages the authorization, claims processing and reimbursement for services acquired from non-VA health care providers through the Purchased Care Program.  The basic provisions of and authority for the Purchased Care Program are provided through public laws passed by Congress.  These laws have been codified into the United States Code and further clarified in the Code of Federal Regulations.  Various VA policies and directives have been written to provide additional interpretation.VA seeks an interim system to improve Purchased Care claims management. Due to the length of time needed to deploy long-term business process and technology changes, an interim technology system is needed to support and improve current operations.

Visitor services are conducted everyday, except 2 days, throughout the year, with spring and summer receiving the highest visitation.  Tours conducted in the interior portions of the dam will continue to be conducted by Federal Reclamation staff.

<DESC><p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e).<br />The Bureau of the Public Debt on behalf of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is seeking information from vendors with the interest and capability to provide technical assistance and reporting related to the Drug Free Communities Support Program.
<p>Background<br />The Drug-Free Communities Program (DFC) was created by the Drug-Free Communities Act, 1997 (Public Law 105-20), reauthorized through the Drug-Free Communities Reauthorization Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-82) and reauthorized again through the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-469). The latest reauthorization extended the program for an additional five years until 2012.</p>
<p>The mission of the Drug-Free Communities Program is to strengthen local collaboration to achieve and maintain a reduction in local youth drug use in communities across the country. In order to undertake this mission, ONDCP supports community coalitions in the development and implementation of comprehensive, long-term plans to prevent substance abuse among youth.</p>
<p>The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) directs the Drug Free Communities Support Program in partnership with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This anti-drug program provides grants of up to $125,000 to community coalitions that mobilize their communities to prevent youth alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug, and inhalant abuse. There are currently 769 grantees in all 50 states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Palau.</p>
<p>The major purposes of this National DFC Evaluation contract is to support an effective grant monitoring system that provides the Federal government with the expertise, system, functions and products to collect, analyze and report objectively and regularly monitor and measure data in order to demonstrate the progress of the overall National DFC and its grantee support mechanisms.</p>
<p>The data and reports obtained for monitoring are critical to inform grant and project management, targeted Technical Assistance and for continuous quality improvement of the individual grants and the program as a whole. The process, capacity and outcome data to be collected, analyzed and reported are critical in understanding the nature of effective coalitions, the influences that support or hinder them, and the outcomes associated with their developmental levels as delineated by a theoretically based typology.</p>
<p>Goals<br />&middot; To assure that a web based data collection and reporting system supports the National evaluation and the performance monitoring of the DFC grant program<br />&middot; To perform analyses and produce reports that respond to Federal requirements, answer the DFC evaluation questions, and portray the progress of the DFC program at the Federal and local levels in meeting its goals and objectives</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Objectives<br />&middot; To review an already developed coalition typology and tool and recommend it's continued use in current or modified format.<br />&middot; To design and implement a comprehensive National DFC program evaluation taking into consideration the current logic model and program, as well as Federal requirements, historical and current data definitions, data collection tools, analytic frame and reports.<br />&middot; To perform appropriate state of the art analyses that yield findings that address DFC program and Federal requirements including but not limited to GPRA, PART and other performance assessments.<br />&middot; To create an environment for dispersed and creative analyses beyond the Federally required and defined requirements that yield findings that move the field of community prevention forward.<br />&middot; To review the current DFC program's web- based performance system and make recommendations for its continued use or another unique approach.<br />&middot; To generate publishable reports, internal documents, and presentation materials appropriate for various types of audiences, that demonstrate and explain analytic findings relevant to DFC program monitoring and performance in terms of process, capacity and outcome measures and characteristics that are key to grantee success.<br />&middot; To provide technical assistance and guidance materials to grantees, program managers and Federal administrators in the collection and reporting of data and use of any implemented web applications.<br />&middot; To develop a new or adapt the current web based data system to meet the needs described for the DFC national program</p>
<p>Vendors shall not contact ONDCP regarding this RFI. All correspondence shall be sent to the email address listed below to the attention of L. Gossett.</p>
<p>The government currently is considering the possibility of a small business set-aside. To assist with this determination, interested vendors should respond with the following information: <br />&middot; A short summary (1-2 pages) of experience in evaluation as it relates to drug prevention and/or community initiatives and/or social science research<br />&middot; A short description of experience in dealing with OMB clearance issues<br />&middot; Ability to design, build and manage web applications<br />&middot; Business size (small, large, other) and socioeconomic category of your firm (HubZone, SDVOSB, woman-owned, etc.)</p>
<p>Responses are to be submitted electronically by 2:00 p.m. November 18, 2008 to psb3@bpd.treas.gov attn: L. Gossett</p>

<DESC>Subject:  Support to develop Comparative Analysis of Forensic Video Specification Study on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, Directorate of Science and Technology, Division of Command, Control, and Interoperability (CCI).
Response Date:  November 05, 2008
Contact:  Contracting Officer:  Lisa Mattocks (lisa_a_mattocks@nbc.gov)
Agency:  Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate, Sierra Vista Branch.
At this time, the Acquisition Services Directorate, Sierra Vista Branch intends to award, on behalf of Department of Homeland Security, a thirteen (13) month contract to a qualified contractor able to develop a searchable toner and printing inks library.  If the results of this market survey indicate there are no potential qualified sources that can support this proposed effort, the Government will consider issuing a sole source contract.  The estimated ceiling for this contract is $339,000.00.  The requirement will require the execution of the following tasks:
Task 1 State of the Art in Expert-based Video Comparison - Report
This report should enumerate and evaluate current methodologies, existing guidelines, court case references/challenges, and any currently available tools used for the comparison of a video image to a three-dimensional object by an imaging or video expert. The report should address the current analytical guidelines, error rates, best practices, etc. for the forensic imaging or video specialist. The information included within the report should be garnered from a variety of sources through a literature review.
Task 2 Video Comparison Testing
All testing should be conducted using a single, fixed camera system to establish baseline results. The camera system should be chosen for use based on what is generally used in black and white, digital CCTV applications.  
Fixed requirements for the video system (subject to review with DHS COTR following completion of task 1 literature review report): "	Recording resolution: 640 (vertical) x 480 (horizontal) "	Object lighting level:   standard indoor lighting conditions"	Time-lapse recording"	No image compressionThe main question to be answered by Task 2 is whether an imaging expert can scientifically individualize an item in a video by comparing the two-dimensional video image to the three-dimensional recovered item.  Other questions to be considered are:"	Under what circumstances (distance, illumination, etc) can individualization be determined? "	Should comparisons be performed picture-to-picture or picture-to-object?"	Is photogrammetry feasible and/or necessary when comparing 3D items to images?"	What constitutes a rare feature in the variety of objects which may be recorded by CCTV footage?  Can these rare features be considered individualizing characteristics?"	When does the number of corresponding features between the physical object and the image of the object reach such significance as to preclude the possibility that they have occurred by chance?"	How should examiners estimate the population frequencies of corresponding features located during the comparison?


Task 3 Publication Submission
A report evaluating the test results from task 2 should be submitted for publication to the Journal of Forensic Sciences or other scholarly, peer-reviewed journal.  The report should address if items in video images can be matched to three-dimensional clothing items accurately and reliably.  If it is determined that these comparisons can be performed in a scientific manner and produce accurate results, guidelines for performing the comparisons should be enumerated.  The report should also include error rates and references. 
Interested contractors are invited to identify their interest and technical capability for the requirement areas listed above, by close of business, 03 November 2008.  Brochures alone are not sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities, conflict free redials, and unbiased status.  Send written responses to Lisa Mattocks, DOI, NBC, Acquisition Services Directorate, Sierra Vista Branch, P.O. Box 12924, Fort Huachuca, AZ, 85670-2924, or via email to lisa_a_mattocks@nbc.gov.  Send facsimile responses to 520.538.0415.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  If responses to the market survey indicate there are no other properly qualified sources, Note 22 shall apply.

<DESC>United States Government
Seeks Sources for Lease of Office and Related Space
in Northern Virginia

REQUIREMENT:     The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Fairfax, Virginia.  The lease is expiring and the Government is seeking to lease approximately 19,000 ANSI/BOMA rentable square feet of office and related space.  The space must meet or be capable of being altered to meet the Government’s specifications, as well as current requirements for Fire and Life Safety and Handicapped Accessibility.  

The Government is interested in considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.  

LOCATION:     The unique facility must be located in Virginia, within the following delineated area:
	North – Route 50
	West – Stringfellow Road
	South – Route 29
	East – Jermantown Road

LEASE TERM: The proposed rental term shall be for five (5) years firm with a five (5) year renewal option.

OCCUPANCY:     Space must be ready for occupancy by August 1, 2009.         

Owners, brokers or agents may offer space for consideration.  Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.

Expressions of interest should include the following information:

1.       Building name, address, age and the location of the available space within the building.
2.       Available square footage (ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) and BOMA rentable square feet (BRSF)).
3.       Schedule for completion and occupancy date.
4.       Expected rental rate information quotation per OASF for a fully-serviced lease for a five (5) year firm term with a five (5) year renewal option.  The quoted rental rate shall include a Tenant Improvement Allowance equal to $42.08 per OASF.
5.       Scaled floor plans (as-built) identifying offered space.
6.       Information on project and building ownership.

Expressions of interest must be in writing and should be forwarded by 4:00 pm on Tuesday, November 4, 2008 to:

The items specified above represent a follow on to previous contracts with Eclypse International Corporation.  The purposed contract action is for services for commercial items, which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government will not pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of data or other costs incurred in response to this announcement. See Note 22. 
Notice for filing agency protests: It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that an Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). 
(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
(v) Others similar interests.

SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT
OFFICE OF FOREIGN DISASTER ASSISTANCE (OFDA) DIVISION
OF THE U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID)
Dubai, United Arab Emirates

1.0 - Introduction: 
Ongoing humanitarian support requirements around the globe require USAID/OFDA to maintain a wide variety stockpile of Non-Food Items (NFI) assets, equipment, vehicles and materials at Dubai, United Arab Emirates (a major transshipment hub between Europe and Asia).  The purpose is to ensure our rapid response and immediate transport of U.S. humanitarian relief supplies to locations worldwide.  Our warehouse ensures efficiency and cost effectiveness in serving the U.S. Government’s disaster response requirements.

The warehouse will/may stock a wide variety of materials and equipment which will include the NFI (non-food-items) commodities such as plastic sheeting, wool blankets, hygiene kits, etc.  USAID/OFDA maintains approximately 8 different types of commodities at this warehouse.  In addition, USAID/OFDA intends to store approximately twenty lightly and fully armored vehicles at this location.   The estimated value of the vehicles alone will be approximately US 3.5 million dollars.   The warehouse will be used as a staging point to deliver humanitarian aid and support equipment (vehicles) to those in need, whether it’s beneficiaries or USAID personnel.   The warehouse in Dubai requires a full time Warehouse Manager to oversee 1) on-site handling and storage operations, and facility upkeep; 2) the equipment necessary to perform OFDA warehouse and support operations; 3) the local service sector support (time and materials) regarding warehouse upkeep and, 4) the processing of shipping documentation (i.e. Customs clearances and handling charges) and providing logistics support.  As part of the overall warehouse functions, equipment such as forklifts, pallet jacks and machinery used in the movement, packing, and shipping of commodities will be purchased and maintained by the Warehouse Manager (note, these items become contractor purchased, Government-owned property) (see Government owned property at Appendix A).

2.0 – Justification & Authorization:  
The people of the world are affected by natural and civil disasters.  As the responding agency for the United States government, the United States Agency for International Development Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) is mandated to be prepared to assist those people with the immediate delivery of relief supplies, at a moments notice.  In meeting this mandate, OFDA established warehouse facilities, in specifically chosen locations, to stockpile essential commodities for immediate shipment.   We hire firms to manage our facilities and commodities and support the logistical needs requested by OFDA.  

For the people living in the regions of East and South Central Africa, and Asia, OFDA established an emergency warehouse facility and stockpile in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. This warehouse is centrally located to effectively respond to both natural disasters, such as the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, or civil disasters, such as the existing complex emergency (drought and ethnic cleansing) in the Darfur region of Sudan.  OFDA’s response to these and other disasters is always both timely and efficient.  In addition, other countries in the various regions are continually at risk; such as drought in the Horn of Africa, earthquakes in the Middle East, or the combination of natural disaster in the wake of civil conflict as in the case of Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
Commodities supplied by OFDA are in demand and replacement of commodities requires time for manufacture and transport to our facility. Therefore, it is mandatory that warehouse operations be monitored to ensure 1) exact inventory control; 2) sufficient labor and materials are available for operations; 3) proper handling equipment is positioned and operational at the warehouse to support daily operations; and 4) that the functions of the facility are supported by the service sector (labor, janitorial, maintenance & shipping services) to maintain both a clean and functional facility  In so doing, the Warehouse Manager (contractor) provides OFDA the tools to meet the life saving requirements which develop during a disaster.

M.2  BASIS FOR AWARD 	

The NAICS code is 493110, and the business size standard is $23,500,000.00 revenue.  The Government will make award to the responsible offeror (s) whose offer conforms to the requirements of the solicitation and is evaluated as being the most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, technical merit is more important than cost or price.  Award will not be automatically determined by numerical calculation or formula relationship between cost or price and technical merit.  As technical merit of the offerors' proposals becomes more equal, the evaluated cost or price may become the determining factor.  The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and cost or price promises the greatest value to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award without discussions.  Therefore, the initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms and statement of capability from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public’s interest, and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  Discussions, if held, may take the form of written questions, site visits or oral presentations.

This RFP does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of any proposal or in making necessary studies for the preparation thereof.  The RFP does not commit the Government to procure or contract for said services.  The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this proposed procurement.  



M.3		COST REALISM EVALUATION	


The Government may conduct a cost realism evaluation in order to determine if the overall costs proposed are (1) realistic for the work to be performed; (2) reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and (3) are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's technical proposal.



M.4		METHOD OF AWARD - AGRREGATE BASIS, ALL ITEMS 	

The line items in Section B of this solicitation will be awarded on an aggregate basis for all solicitation items. Only one award will result from this solicitation.

(a) The offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine whether it meets the requirements described in the solicitation.

(b) A cost and/or price analysis shall be conducted based upon the data submitted by the offeror in order to determine that the negotiated cost or price is fair and reasonable.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD).  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) is within DRM and was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response mechanism.  It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups.  The Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Advisor is part of the Health Team in TAG.

INTRODUCTION

The WASH Advisor is an integral part of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) Health Team. OFDA addresses all disaster health risks with a strong focus on identifying and managing health risks in complex humanitarian emergencies (CHEs).  In natural and complex emergencies, excess mortality results from malnutrition, malaria, measles, diarrheal diseases, and acute respiratory infections. HIV/AIDS is increasingly recognized as a contributing factor to excess mortality in disasters.  These conditions disproportionately affect vulnerable groups (children under five years of age, the elderly, and women). The team provides technical assistance to OFDA including assessments, proposal reviews, risk management, capacity building and technical innovations to address the major causes of excess morbidity and mortality.  OFDA’s water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions include hygiene education and promotion, establishment and/or rehabilitation of water sources such as hand dug wells, water testing, support for water user committees, sanitation intervention at household level, and environmental health activities.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires a Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Advisor who will provide OFDA with technical assistance in program assessment and planning, strategy development and implementation, monitoring of WASH mitigation and response activities, and technical representation in worldwide forums and working groups.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

•	Contribute to the formulation and articulation of appropriate WASH strategies and policies for OFDA and the rest of the U.S. Government (USG) in disaster and emergency-related situations;
•	Provide crucial technical expertise and recommendations to ensure that OFDA health responses, specifically those dealing with WASH issues are robust, rapid and appropriate;
•	Monitor OFDA WASH funded programs and provide assistance for improving outcomes;
•	Provide the technical linkage between OFDA and other organizations, i.e. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Inter-Agency Steering Committee (IASC) WASH cluster, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and non-governmental organization (NGO) partners that are involved in disaster and emergency response issues related to WASH;
•	Maintain up-to-date, expert-level knowledge of the technical area and of the organizations engaged in related program activities;
•	Act as a technical expert and point of contact for senior professionals, senior officials and implementing partners on WASH issues;

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

NGA is a Department of Defense (DoD) Combat Support Agency that provides timely, relevant and accurate Geospatial Intelligence to both the DoD and the Intelligence Community (IC) in support of the National Security Objectives.
