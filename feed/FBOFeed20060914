<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation. No further announcement will be made regarding this opportunity. 

The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to obtain the contracting services necessary to setup and maintain a National Tobacco Processing/Call Center NTPC).

Also, to procure services necessary to maintain the existing Tobacco Transition Payment Program (TTPP) and Successor-In-Interest (SII) systems, and provide support to develop and deploy new system functionality, including user and system documentation, in the Farm Service Agency (FSA) production environment.  
Currently the Tobacco Program has an estimated 600,000 contracts and it is estimated that for FY 2006, 30% of the contracts will be sold to financial institutions under the SII. The remaining contracts will retained by the quota holder or producer. 

This procurement is for contractor support in the area of 1099 reporting for the TTPP program for FSA.  This SOW includes the tasks of calculating imputed interest, printing and distributing 1099s for FSA customers that receive TTPP payments, and other support tasks cited in this Statement of Work (SOW).

This procurement provides general requirements for the production and distribution of quarterly assessment bills for the tobacco manufacturers and importers, tracking of individual company bills, payments and account balances, and other related support tasks.

<CONTACT>Sharon Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 427-1781, Fax 301 427-1740, Email swilliam@ahrq.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to award on a sole-source basis to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine a contract to continue to support the HIV Research Network.  This is a continuation of work previously conducted by Johns Hopkins University.  The contract is to collect and analyze data related to health services utilization by persons with HIV infection during CY 2006-2008.  Provider sites that participate in this network both provide clinical care to patients with HIV infection and transfer clinical and resource utilization data on these patients to a central data center.  The data center amalgamates the data from the various sites, puts the data into a uniform format, conducts analyses of the assembled data, and prepares reports that address issues concerning (1) utilization of resource by persons with HIV disease, and (2) procedures to reduce the likelihood of medical errors in the treatment of HIV.  This project requires the contractor to have close contacts with clinical sites providing HIV care, and to have established procedures and protocols whereby the site transfers specific data elements from existing clinical records to the contractor.  A significant component of activity in this project consists of obtaining medical record data from HIV provider sites and working with each site to ensure that data are transmitted in a uniform format.  Johns Hopkins School of Medicine has been engaged in this activity since October 1998 and already has several years of data assembled and has established close relationships with staff at each of the 17 provider sites.  We know of no other entity that has developed data sharing procedures with an equivalent number of sites in several states across the country.  The proposed acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  It is anticipated that one award will be made with a period of performance of three years.  Award of contract is expected in September 2006.  In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will also be available for downloading from the internet on the AHRQ website at www.ahrq.gov.  Once in the AHRQ home page, go to Funding Opportunities, then Contract Solicitations.  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation and monitor the site for any subsequent amendments.  No bidders list will be available.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be evaluated by AHRQ and a peer review panel.  It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on or about June 5, 2006.

<DESC>PR Number(s): 2915013432931PR, FA810406R0598 Item: 0001 NSN: 2915013432931PRPR SENSOR,TEMPERATURE, P/N: 1534M60P04,  Description: Temperature is sensed by a helium-filled sensing coil acting upon sensing bellows attached to a metering valve.  A second bellows is reference bellows.  Pressurized helium gas in sensing coil reacts to temperature changes.  When temperature increases, gas pressure increases. When temperature decreases, gas pressure decreases.  Control servo pressure (PC) is supplied through a fixed orifice in main engine control.  Pressure between fixed orifice and metering valve is P6 Pressure.  Pressure (P6) is regulated to that required to overcome force of helium acting on sensing bellows, plus force of preload springs, plus force of bypass pressure (PD) acting on reference bellows.  This interaction of forces regulats P6 at a constant value above PD at a constant value above PD at a given temperature. An increases in temperature expands helium gas in sensing coil and sensing bellows.  As sensing bellows expands, opening at metering valve is decreased.  A smaller amount of P6 is than blec to PD, thus increasing P6 pressure.   A temperature decrease in helium-filled sensing coil causes gas to contract.  As gas contracts, metering valve opens farther, bleeding more P6 pressure to PD, and P6 pressure decreases.  The reference bellows allows for variations in PD and is used to maintain absolute pressure reference. FUNCTION:  The sensor is a temperature sensor and transducer unit for main engine control.  It responds to changes in fan discharge temperature and regulates pressure as a function of discharge temperature.  DIMENSIONS: 'Sensor body/length 3.000inches, width 4.390 inches, height 2.400 inches. Temperature coil dimensions:  length 7.188 inches, width 2.750 inches, height 2.750 inches, weight (dry) 2.82 lbs, signal pressures 24.1-182.4 PSI above main fuel pump boost pressure and proportional to temperature, filter screen size 70 microns (nominal), pressure line  connection0.562-18 UNF-3A thread, temperature range -65F to 480F.  MATERIAL:  consists of aluminum exterior surfaces anodized per MIL-L-8625 class I Type II. Total Line Item Qty:10-20,21-32    Destn: FB2039,Tinker AFB,OK.,73145-9013.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the request for quote for the required items under Purchase Request N00189-06-T-0395.  A subsequent solicitation document will not be issued. FISC Norfolk intends to purchase on a sole source basis the following item(s):  (5) Each, Netscreen 204 A/C Power Cords US P/N NS-204-001, (5) Each, Netscreen 200 Rack 19 P/N NS-200-RCK-01 and (1) Each Core support for N204 P/N SVC-COR-204. Delivery will be 3 weeks after the receipt of order. Manufactured by Juniper Networks US Inc. 1194 North Mathilda Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA. 94089.  Substitutes in brand name would not be feasible because this a one for one replacement and no other brand item would work and time does not permit experimenting with the technology.  Since fleet readiness is the critical path under this action, an equal product would require extensive technical review to determine its comparability and integration capability into the existing equipment configurations.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIRWD), China Lake, CA intends to procure, on an other than full and open competition basis, systems engineering  and technical support in the development, testing, and fielding of future Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2ISR) systems.  The proposed contract will provide for the evaluation of alternatives and initial engineering design to operational deployment of systems that provide image intelligence (IMINT), communications intelligence (COMINT), signal intelligence (SIGINT), and/or measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) services to the warfighter. Engineering and technical services obtained hereunder will be applied to the design, development, testing, and integration of Navy and National Community-sponsored processing, precision targeting, geospatial visualization and exploitation systems. The total required level of effort (LOE) is estimated to be 97,100 hours. The period of performance (POP) will commence upon award and will continue for a period of five years. Deliveries will be made free on board (FOB) destination. It is anticipated that the proposed contract type will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity with the inclusion of performance based task orders. Award to any other source other than Integrity Applications Incorporated (IAI) would result in approximately $3,000,000 of duplicative costs to transfer technology, knowledge, and train qualified engineers and software developers on the details and history of past developments necessary to continue their testing and transition.  This training and transfer of expertise would require years to complete and given the fast paced development of threats in the Globar War on Terrorism the requirement to provide rapid response, there is no time to allow another contractor to get up to speed.  Accordingly it is in the Government's best interest to pursue an acquisition with IAI using other than full and open competition. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firms believing that they can fulfill the requirement may submit a written response to be received at the contracting office no later than 45b  days after the date of publication of this notice, clearly showing its ability to do so without causing programmatic hardship. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses shall be submitted by email to shaleen.lambert@navy.mil or to Commander, Code 210000D (S. Lambert), NAVAIR WD, 429 E. Bowen Rd. Mail Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108. Award is anticipated on or about 1 January 2007. See numbered notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis, Preparation of purified HIV viruses and HIV-infected cells for high resolution electron microscopy, with Imquest Biosciences Inc, 7340 Executive Way, Frederick, Maryland 21704.

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.   The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The purpose of this requirement is to provide highly purified AIDS viruses for use in efforts to understand the structural basis of virus function and viral entry.  These studies are expected to provide valuable information for design of vaccines against AIDS.   The preparation of purified HIV viruses and HIV infected cells must be performed under controlled conditions.   

Imquest Biosciences, Inc is the only source known to the NCI that can provide purified viruses that must meet stringent specifications for purity and concentration and are suitable for high resolution electron microscopic analysis, as well as being performed under controlled conditions.   This includes specifications of <5% contamination from microvesicles, concentrations > 10**11 virions/ml, and protocols that ensure that viruses have been through only round of infection, and not multiply passaged.   As infected cell preparations need to be transported to NCI within one hour of inactivation, in order for processing for electron microscopic experiments, Imquest Biosciences is located within the one (1) hour time frame.  This requires close co-ordination of experiments at the vendor site with NCI lab personnel working on the cells, and requires close physical proximity of the vendor to the NCI laboratory.

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid registration/certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute?s (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA),  intend to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Philips Medical Systems, 595 Miner RD., Highland Heights, OH. , 44143, to purchase a 3.0T Freewave RF platform upgrade from 16 to 32 channels for the LDDR magnet (S/N 10731).  This 32-channel Freewave platform will allow the read-out 32 elements of a 32-channel independently and simultaneously.

This requirement is under the North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS)	 423450 and the Size Standard is 100 employees.

To achieve this goal using 32 channel 3E MR scanner is essential with an appropriate 32 channel coil. Philips Medical Systems is the only known source that can currently provide this upgrade. Therefore, an award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute?s (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA),  intend to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Children?s Hospital & Research Center Oakland, 5700 Martin Luther King Jr. Way, Oakland, CA., 94609, to provide BAC Library Construction and Screening of Genomic DNA from ENU mouse mutants. 

The sole source determination is based upon the requirement for making BAC Libraries and retrieval of BAC Clones Spanning Critical Region containing ENU induced Mouse mutations. 
NHLBI is interested exploring improved mapping & sequencing procedures for identifying mutations in ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenized mice with congenital heart defect. Dr. Pieter de Jong, is the head of the BAC/PAC Resource Center (BPRC) of Children?s Hospital Research Center Oakland was selected based on the fact he is well recognized as the world?s leading expert  in making and screening of BAC libraries. He has generated many of the BAC Libraries used in the Human Genome Project, and nearly all of the existing BAC libraries from inbred mouse strains in the Mouse Genome Project. In addition he has also developed a very high throughput  pipeline for screening BAC libraries involving the unique assembly of macroarrays, and the continue use of the BAC Libraries in the Research Protocol. Based upon the knowledge, skills, and expertise possessed by Dr. Pieter de Jong, an award to any other source would affect the Institute?s anticipated outcome based upon Dr. Jong?s experience, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.   


Statement of Work:   Making BAC  Libraries and Retrieval of BAC Clones Spanning Critical Region Containing ENU Induced Mouse Mutations.  
Summary: NHLBI is interested exploring improved mapping & sequencing procedures for identifying mutations in ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenized mice with congenital heart defect and is seeking to subcontract part of the work. Many recessive mutations in different mutant mice pedigrees have been mapped through genetic crosses to distinct genomic intervals spanning between one and five mega basepairs. The embryos homozygous for the mutation will be the source of DNA for the sequencing project. One or more frozen embryos per mutant pedigree will be available to the contractor. The contactor will isolate high molecular weight DNA from these embryos to create one DNA clone collection per mutant pedigree and will screen the DNA clone collection for all clones from the genomic interval containing the defective gene. This region will from here-on be referred to as the critical region.  Following the identification and isolation DNA clones derived from the critical region, these clones will be characterized further by sequencing of the paired ends of the cloned DNA fragments.  The paired-end sequences will be matched to the mouse genome as available through public databases. The goal is to identify a minimal set of DNA clones spanning all or most (>98%) of the critical region. These isolated minimal set of clones will be delivered to NHBLI and will serve as the substrates for high-throughput genomic sequencing of the critical region. 
DEFINITIONS: 

DNA Clones:  E.coli clones containing large DNA fragments (average 150 kilo base pairs) of mouse genomic DNA. These fragments will have been cloned into a low-copy number ?Bacterial Artificial Chromosome? (BAC) vector. 

BAC vector:  Many versions of BAC vectors now exist. The contractor should have extensive track-record with cutting-edge BAC vectors and their use to create mouse BAC libraries. 

BAC library: A collection of DNA clones created from a single DNA source, each derived from a single, unique cloning event in E.coli.  The cloning process should approximate as much as possible a random process. In this case, each library will have been generated from pooled homozygously-mutated embryos from a single mutant pedigree.

Arrayed BAC library: Clones, derived from unique cloning events, will be grown in spatial separation. To this aim, the freshly-transformed E.coli cells will have to be separated prior to first cell division. This is needed to ensure that all BAC clones are independent. The process requires colony-picking robots to move E.coli colonies from Petri dishes into separate wells of 384-well dishes. The wells contain growing media with a proper antibiotic (in most cases, chloramphenicol) and supplemented with glycerol (for cryo-preservation of the cultures). 

BAC library size: The size of a BAC library is defined by the level of redundancy within the random clone collection.  A ?tenfold redundant? BAC library will be needed for this process to improve the odds that all sequences from the critical region are present at least once in the clone collection. On average, each sequence element will be present 10 times in independent BAC clones. This high level of redundancy is required for two reasons: 1) to minimize or avoid any gaps in the ?critical region? due to sequences missing from the BAC library, and 2) to maximize the number of options for selecting BAC clones which  minimally overlap with other BAC clones with respect to sequence content. This is important because the cost of sequencing is proportional to the number of BAC clones submitted to the sequencing pipeline. Extensive overlaps between BAC clones add significantly to the downstream cost of sequencing the entire critical region.

BAC Array size: The total number of microtiter dishes corresponding to a single copy of the BAC library. For a tenfold redundant mouse BAC library, about 500-600 microtiter dishes will be needed. 

BAC library quality:  The quality of a BAC library is defined by a set of different parameters: 
1) Randomness of the cloning process: partial-digestion with a restriction enzyme (EcoRI) will be required to generate the random fragments in advance of cloning, 
2) Average insert sizes of the cloned DNA fragments (average 150 kilo base pairs (kbp) or larger will be required , 
3) Minimal levels of cloning artifacts, in particular those which result in chimeric clones containing multiple unrelated fragments in a single BAC. The contractor will need to have a proven track record of creating BAC libraries with chimera levels below 1%. 
4) Minimal levels of well without any clones. Less than 10% empty well required. 


BAC library screening: The BAC library will need to be screened to identify BAC clones containing sequences derived from the critical region. This will need to be done by DNA hybridization of complex mixtures of probes, to membranes containing macro-arrays representative of the arrayed BAC library. The contractor will need to have a proven track record creating high quality macro-arrays for hybridization screening and a record of using these for screening BAC libraries with complex probe mixtures. 

Macro-arrays: Membranes containing large numbers of DNA spots derived from BAC clones. The spots are placed in regular, organized patterns and each spot can be traced back to a specific BAC clone archived in a freezer as part of an arrayed BAC library. Each membrane should represent all clones contained in 48 microtiter dishes of the BAC library. The entire library might be represented by as much as 10 such macro-arrays. 
Probe mixtures: In order to identify all clones through a single hybridization screening, radioactively-labeled probes representing the critical region will be pooled together. Probes will need be selected at regular (50 kbp) intervals along the critical region and will all have a similar composition (but distinct sequence). Intervals of approximately 50 kbp will ensure that each BAC from the critical region will likely be positive for several probes to minimize false-negative rates. 

Probes:  To permit probes to be mixed in large numbers, they will need to behave at similar hybridization stringency to avoid ?weaker probes? being masked by better hybridizing probes. The probe will need to be designed with this requirement in mind. Overgo probes are synthetic DNA probes derived from 3?overlapping 24-mers with an 8 nucleotide overlap. These probes are labeled by extending the 3?ends using a DNA polymerase and 32P-dNTPs.  Overgo probes are designed to have the same melting point and can thus be co-hybridized at the same stringency. Twenty probes are required per Mbp of genomic DNA. Up to 150 probes (8 Mbp) can be pooled for a successful screen.

BAC re-arraying: BAC clones are identified in the screening process through positive hybridization spots on the macro arrays. These BACs are considered candidate clones containing sequences derived from the critical region. 

Twenty probes are required per Mbp of genomic DNA. Up to 150 probes (8 Mbp) can be pooled for a successful screen.

BAC re-arraying: BAC clones are identified in the screening process through positive hybridization spots on the macro arrays. These BACs are considered candidate clones containing sequences derived from the critical region. 

BAC characterization: BAC clones from the critical region will need to be confirmed and defined. The BAC clones will need to be submitted to a sequencing center or company for determining the sequences at the ends of inserts. The paired end sequence provide crucial information defining the size and chromosomal position of the clones. The contractor will select a minimal number of BAC clones spanning the region. It is likely that some sequences are not present either due to incompatibility for cloning in E.coli or for statistical reasons. The missing sequences should ideally not encompass more than 4% of the critical region. To eliminate false-negatives from the screening process, the macro arrays might be screened again with a limited set of probes neighboring the clone gaps.  The BAC clones from the minimal set will be characterized for size using pulsed-field electrophoresis. The size of each BAC should match the predicted size. The predicted size is determined from the distances spanned by the paired BAC-end sequences relative to the mouse genome assembly in the public databases.  

PROCESS DESCRIPTION: 
The contractor will receive a number of snap-frozen embryos for each of the mutant pedigrees to be processed. The embryos will be grounded to powder using a pestle and mortar under liquid nitrogen. The powder will be suspended in a chromatin-extraction buffer to minimize shearing and allow the DNA to be maintained in high-molecular weight form. The suspension will be mixed with liquefied agarose and then cooled down to solidify the agarose in a gel mold to create plugs of a defined size. The plugs with the agarose-embedded chromatin will be treated with detergents and proteases to release the matrix-stabilized DNA. The DNA will susbsequently be treated with EcoRI restriction enzyme under partial-digest conditions, meaning that most EcoRI restriction sites will not be cut. The resulting DNA fragment mixture is size-fractionated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in a CHEF apparatus (BioRad). The appropriate size fractions are sliced from the gel, characterized for size and then used for ligation reactions with the BAC vector (pBAC-GK1.1). The transformation mixtures will be used to transform highly-electrocompetent (InVitrogen) DH10B E.coli cells (T1-phage resistant). Several hundred transformations will be required to generate a 10-fold redundant BAC library  with average inserts of around 150 kbp. The freshly-transformed cells mixtures will be cryo-preserved pending characterization to determine suitability and compatibility with the required quality standards. The cells are than spread on big square Petri dishes (20 x 20 cm) to create colonies. The colonies are transferred into separate wells of 384-well dishes, using a Q-pick colony arraying robot. Following overnight growth of the well cultures, the dishes are stored in the freezer until further use. To create the macro arrays, the 384-well dishes are thawed and processed in a filter-gridding robot to create a macro-arrays of >18,000 colonies per membrane. Following overnight growth of the colonies, the membranes are processed to release the DNA and crosslink to the membranes to create the DNA spot array.  The spot arrays (about 10 different macro-arrays per BAC library) will be screened by DNA hybridization using complex mixtures of radioactive overgo probes.

DELIVERABLES:  
1.	One (or more) sets of BAC clones containing sequences from the critical regions from corresponding ENU mutant pedigrees. These BACs will on average have sizes of 150 kbp or better.  The BAC clones will be contained in 384-well dish format and will be shipped on dry ice to NHLBI for further analysis. 
2.	Characterization data for these BAC clones and identification of a subset of BACs containing the minimal BAC tiling set. 
Period of Performance:
The entire process will take a minimal of 3 months per mutant pedigree and may take up to one month longer and is contingent on several external factors. These factors include the quality of the DNA source material and the advance scheduling of the project (or lack there-off). Multiple projects may overlap with one month intervals.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a 2.5 meter diameter, 70-degree sphere cone forebody high-temperature heatshield of SRAM-20, to be developed for space-based applications. The heatshield will be manufactured using an approach that will scale to larger NASA science missions. The completed heatshield will incorporate approximately ten (10) instrumentation plugs in varied locations to fully demonstrate the instrumentation process (instruments will be provided as Government-furnished equipment). SRAM-20 repair techniques will also be demonstrated and documented. The final article will be a manufacturing scale, testable, proof-of-concept product, complete with an Acceptance Data Package, which will mature the approach to manufacturing a large SRAM-20 heatshield to technology readiness level (TRL) 6, ready for infusion to planetary entry missions. The article will be vibration and thermal vacuum tested to provide confidence in its ability to withstand flight acceptance testing environments. This contract will also include any smaller-scale deliverable prototypes necessary to demonstrate fabrication techniques and testability, before the final article is manufactured. This effort has a 5 year history of previous ongoing development, in support of the In-Space Propulsion Technology (ISPT) Aerocapture technology area. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Applied Research Associates, Incorporated (ARA). The Authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C 22304(c)(1). Competition is impractical because ARA is the exclusive supplier of SRAM-20 ablator, a unique material invented at the ARA Ablatives Laboratory. Only ARA has the facilities and processes in place that are required to produce SRAM-20 ablator. ARA has been developing SRAM-20 as applicable to re-entry and aerocapture applications for over 10 years. ARA is the only known source of ablator materials that provide the performance of SRAM-20 in the environments of interest for planetary aerocapture, and has been a primary source over the past 10 years for efficient ablators sought for Aerocapture applications.  Furthermore, the work sought is a logical and necessary follow-on to ISPT investments to date. Completing this manufacturing demonstration is the final step that will bring the SRAM-20 systems to TRL 6 technical maturity and readiness for mission infusion. There is no other candidate ablator material of equivalent performance and technical maturity. ARA's technology has the capability to enable low-cost planetary science missions when properly matured through TRL 6. ARA has been developing SRAM-20 as applicable to re-entry and aerocapture applications for over 10 years.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. local time on Sept. 25, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Questions/concerns shall be submitted in writing to Belinda Triplett at belinda.f.triplett@nasa.gov. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the provision of Communication and Information System (CIS) support to provide voice communications to NATO Operational Mentor and Liaison Team (OMLT) Mobile Operations.

The main objective of this project is to provide voice communications to NATO OMLTs. The voice communications requirement addressed by this project is the internal communications between mobile teams, static NATO Communications Centers at Afghanistan National Army Garrisons, Regional HQ, and ISAF HQ. This will underpin robust force protection and command and control qualities for these teams while they conduct their tasks. OMLTs need to be highly mobile without geographic restrictions due to communications limitations.

This Notification of Intent (NOI) is for the second phase of this project and covers the procurement of the Satellite/Secure Phone. An NOI for the first phase - High Frequency (HF) - was issued on 4th August 2006.  

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The envisaged bidding procedure for this RFQ will be the Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) procedure with the additional opportunity for nominations to the bidders list of firms in addition to those identified by NC3A as BOA vendors.

The estimated value of this project is 1.0 million Euros ($1.3 million USD). The reference of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) is RFQ-CO-12070-OPL. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same RFQ reference.

SUMMARY DESCRIPTION

Background

The main objective of this project is to provide secure voice communication to NATO OMLTs in Afghanistan.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already nominated as identified BOA vendors, additional firms must be introduced by their National Delegations with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE (Specimen in Annex V to Ref.A of NSIP Document 2261) is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Request for Quotation (RFQ) has been issued.

Bidding documents are expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Further performance of the contract will require contractors to have personnel and facility clearances at a level of NATO SECRET. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO facility clearance certification as well as the personnel clearance certifications for all those assigned to the contract.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 21 September 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Request for Quotation (RFQ) to those on the Bidders List: October 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: TBD

4. Anticipated contract award date: November 2006

<DESC>NAICS Code: 61143   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.EPA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to The Council for Excellence in Government.  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide an impartial training program which will provide the Senior Information Officer community with a comprehensive orientation to the Clinger-Cohen functions that The Office of Environmental Information oversees.  This decision is based on this non-partisan organization's unique depth of experience in public policy and government administration, its capacity for the analysis of  regulatory processess, and it well-respected analyses of government practices and processes and programs for educating government managers in the latest innovations and best practices being used in government today.  The CEG conducts several programs to train government administrators/managers.   The CEG's training programs and analysis abilities are augmented by their unique partnerships with people who have real-world experience in working in the government; former government officials and current government managers who have graduated from CEG programs.  Since our market research  indicated that no other organization or company has all of the capabilities necessary to perform this work, it is believed that any cost savings which may be achieved through competition cannot offset the cost of the in-house effort to duplicate the training provided by CEG.  The environmental  Protection Agency knows only of this source for this procurement.  If there are any other potential sources, submit your company capability statement to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Mail Code 3803R Washington, D.C.  20460 Attn: Elaine Scott by September 22,  2006, 2PM EST.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Ahmed El-Kharashy, Business Development Assistant General Manager, 3 El Mokhayem El Dayem Street, El Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt, Phone:  +(202) 263-4000, Fax:  +(202) 263-6060, E-mail:  akharashy@echem-eg.com          Egypt Aromatics Complex Project Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a Feasibility Study on the establishment of a world scale aromatics complex capable of producing petrochemicals for use as feedstock for downstream manufacturing activities in the Arab Republic of Egypt.

In February 2002, the Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Company (Echem) was created by the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum to manage existing publicly held assets and equities in the Egyptian chemical and petrochemical industries and to develop the country's Petrochemical Master Plan.   Echem is mandated to identify and develop new petrochemical and chemical production opportunities in cooperation with its sister organizations the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and the Egyptian Gas Holding Company (EGAS), as well as private companies and investors.  Given the current pace of petrochemical development in Egypt, the proposed Aromatics Complex Project will complete Echem's hydrocarbon value chain and necessary back integration into aromatics feedstock and refinery forward integration.

The Aromatics Complex Project is a key component of Echem's Petrochemical Master Plan.  Echem's objective is to build a greenfield petrochemical plant capable of producing 530,000 MTA of pXylene (PX) and 450,000 MTA of Benzene (BZ) in Egypt.  This project would leverage Egypt's favorable position in feedstock, energy, and geographical location, to establish an aromatics chemicals industry.  The creation of the industry will add to the country's hydrocarbon value chain by establishing downstream petrochemical and specialty chemical opportunities to attract further investments from the private sector.  The Project represents the last link in the value chain from crude oil to the production of polyester and polystyrene.  

The objectives of the Feasibility Study are to analyze the technical, financial, and economic aspects of developing a greenfield petrochemical plant to produce PX and BZ using Naphtha (light gasoline) feedstock from local Egyptian refineries.  PX and BZ are saleable intermediate petrochemical products used as feedstock to manufacture polyester and styrene monomer, respectively.   Polyester is used as a synthetic fiber in the manufacture of bottles and polystyrene is a polymer used in the manufacture of many household items and electrical appliances.  The establishment of an aromatics complex in Egypt would expand the country's burgeoning petrochemicals industry, which is a high priority for the Government of Egypt because of its ability to reduce the country's foreign currency expenditures, and generate foreign currency income as well as employment opportunities for skilled and semi-skilled labor. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $860,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00 noon LOCAL TIME, OCTOBER 31, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

INSTALLATION ADDRESS: Same as delivery
FAR 11.105 Brand-Name Justification: DTIC currently implements and operates its DMZ Web registration system, the Joint Staff J34 Core Vulnerability Application Management Program (CVAMP), and a number of other critical applications using Apple WebObjects middleware application.  Apple has ended support for WebObjects development and production services on other than Apple hardware and Apple Mac OS X 1.4.7 operating system.   This limits DTIC to use of Apple Mac OS X systems in support of development and operation for these critical applications.   DTIC?s existing SIPRNET Mac development desktop systems are over four years old, our out of warranty and are increasingly difficult to maintain and must be replaced.  

     Further, DTIC develops and operates Web Sites for the Department  of Defense that must be compatible with multiple browsers including Apple?s Safari and the Apple Version of Firefox.  To ensure compatibility Apple Mac OS X systems must be used to test HTML code and other elements of web site code.  Finally, DTIC-A Component Information Support has existing Apple Computer systems that out of warranty and currently or soon will not be able  to support the the latest versions of Apple Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5 operating  system.  Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5 running on the Intel processor chip sets improve compatibility between Windows OS and Mac OS X, ease implementation of PKI card operations, and provide improved performance.  Apple is the only manufacturer of systems that can run Mac OS X operating system, and thus the only source to allow DTIC to continue to perform it mission and support its DoD customers properly.
The Government intends to award based upon low-priced, technically acceptable quote.  Award will be made as early as September 21, 2006.  All interested, responsible parties should contact the contract specialist, Joseph Fortuna via e-mail joseph.fortuna@dla.mil or phone 703-767-9562 no later than September 20 for a copy of the solicitation.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Upgrade Existing IX71 Fluorescence Microscope into a IX81 Confocal Microscope

Purpose/Brief History:

The Laboratory of Oxidative Signaling and Therapeutics of LMP/CCR at the National Cancer Institute has a need to upgrade our current Fluorescence Olympus Microscope to Confocal Olympus IX81 live cell imaging microscope system.  This instrument is used to reproducibly produce reactive oxygen species in living cells.

Thee Confocal Olympus IX81 live cell imaging microscope system is a fully PC-controlled device for identification and verification of reactive oxygen species. Minimal training is required when operating the instrument for research purposes in a laboratory environment. The process of time kinetic measurement of reactive oxygen species is fully automated upon placing a culture dish in the chamber and setting up the specified temperature and humidification as well as CO2 in the chamber incubator. Operational parameters are reproducible and the result is strictly PC controlled, enabling a high throughput of vitrified samples, with an easy and straightforward control of the vitrification process. The parameters to be influenced are; temperature, humidity, the number of growth factors stimulation and a number of critical time settings. The instrument will consistently produce excellent collection of live cell reactive oxygen species calculation and visualization.


PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

Olympus the Company is the only manufacturer of an instrument which allows accurate computer control over the temperature and humidity and CO2 of the chamber and provides a unique upgradation of its existing machine with reproducibility. Shuttle measurement of reactive oxygen species measurement is the single most important parameter in obtaining high quality digital images of the living cell.

Only the Olympus IX 81 can meet the following specifications:

1.	The instrument must be compatible with existing Olympus IX71, camera and software we are currently using in the laboratory already.

2.	Time lapse experiments are critical and an external controller for all microscope controls including power supply for illumination are required to minimize focus drift due to heat contraction and expansion of the microscope body.

3.	Lab space is critical and the instrument stand depth should be no more than 400mm.

4.	Multiple wavelength lines are required therefore a six position motorized fluorescence filter turret is required. 

5.	The ability to upgrade to the Olympus Uapo 150x/1.45 oil with correction collar specialized objective for this application are required.

6.	Other advanced applications will be required such as combinations of TIRF and Optical laser traps. The IX71 is the only microscope with a two-tiered input/ output design independent of the fluorescence/TIRF input path allowing some very unique combinations.

7.	True color imaging for H&E stains are required and monochrome imaging for live cell imaging is critical therefore the camera should also include a liquid crystal color filter which can be removed for the live cell imaging.

8.	An environmental chamber is required with Temperature, CO2 and humidity control is required to maintain cell viability.

9.	The Imaging software should be capable of microscope control, time lapse and fluorescence quantification.

10.	 Since the upgrade and addition of other external components may be added in the future device drivers for the future upgrades should be included in the base package rather then having to purchase drivers for every future device.

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) intends to procure 5 ea M240D Medium Machine Guns and Egress Kits (a sole item) from FNH USA, LLC (a sole source) to meet its critical mission requirements.  DEA has determined that the FNH USA M240D Medium Machine Gun is the only item meeting DEA mission requirements.  DEA has also determined that the M240D Medium Machine Gun is a military/law enforcement weapon system and falls under the National Firearems Act of 1934 (NFA).  The NFA restricts the sale of these firearms to only the federal government.  Since FNH USA, LLC does not have any distributors that sell the weapon system, then DEA must procure these firearms directly from the manufacturer on a sole source basis.  Therefore, DEA intends to conduct this sole-item/sole-source procurement under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 and no other items or sources will be considered.  A pulic solicitation will not be available.  This notice satisfies the requirements of FAR Part 5.  The estimated value of the procurement is $50,000.

<CONTACT>Kathy Fain, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-4853, Fax 410-965-9560, Email kathryn.fain@ssa.gov
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SourceMedia Inc., d/b/a Accuity, formerly Thomson Financial Publishing (TFP), 4709 West Golf Road, Suite 600, Skokie, IL 60076-1253 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, ???Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements???, to purchase hardware maintenance and support services as outlined below.  This is part the Financial Institution Information Verification project, which has just completed its three year Proof of Concept stage.   The Foster Care Independence Act gives SSA the right to require Supplemental Security Income (SSI) applicants, recipients and deemors to give authorization to financial institutions (FI) to provide verification of an SSI applicant???s, recipient???s or deemor???s financial assets.  SSA???s current process for obtaining asset verification is paper-based.  The form SSA-4641-U2, Authorization for the Social Security Administration to Obtain Account Records From A Financial Institution and Request for Records, is mailed to the FI and asks the FI to provide the balance held in a financial account at specified dates.  SSA is seeking contractor support to refine, implement and maintain the system, which SSA and Accuity have worked on for three years.  Accuity serves as the official registrar of the Routing Number System for the American Bankers Association (ABA); they are purportedly the single source for assigning and retiring routing numbers for every institutions that meets the criteria established by the ABA; it is believed that every financial institution in the US must come to them to be assigned, to retire, or to change a routing number.  In their capacity as Official Registrar of the Routing Number System for the ABA, Accuity collects, processes, and maintains a database of current information on financial institutions worldwide.  SSA previously awarded three successive orders, of one year each, to Accuity, for the Proof of Concept (POC) for these services.  During the POC phase, Accuity successfully demonstrated a process for verifications and reimbursement requests from a number of test offices in selected states.  This involved converting to electronic media the informational exchanges that now occur in paper form each year between financial institutions and SSA during the initial application period and the re-determination process.  In addition to requesting account balances and interest income revealed by the applicant/recipient, the POC also requested and verified titling and balance information on all types of accounts or certificates held by the applicant/recipient.  The initial POC phase was successfully completed, and a second, follow-on phase of the POC, featuring gathering of study data for a potential nationwide roll-out of the SSA/Accuity proprietary accounts verification program, was implemented the next year.  Following that, SSA???s proceeded to the ???Fully Developed Phase??? and worked to complete systems development to fully automate the account verification, reimbursement processes, with the ultimate goal to make the verification process totally transparent to the user so that the system automatically generates verification requests, records the response and then only generates alerts to the user for cases requiring further action.  SSA now intends to set up an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract, with one base year and two option years, for a proposed extension of the Accuity process from the POC phase to the fully developed phase that includes: a) continuing support for the Accuity POC system in the New York/New Jersey FOs and the OQP regional sites; b) recruitment of additional FIs across the nation to participate in the Accuity process; c) process enhancements to the Accuity POC system; d) upgrade the asset verification system to ensure that the system has the capacity, redundancy/backup and data security capabilities necessary to support continued expansion to additional SSA FOs; e) phased rollout of the Accuity process to additional SSA FOs; and f) support for the Office of Systems initiative to incorporate the automated SSA-4641-U2 request form into the Modernized SSI Claims System. To date, Accuity is the only company identified by SSA that has the capability for detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customer???s name and social security number as the identifying information.  The SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and published multiple sources sought notices to identify alternative source s of supply for these services.  This research has demonstrated to the SSA that Accuity is the only organization uniquely qualified to implement all the tasks required by SSA.  Again, this is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with Accuity for these follow-on services and not a request for competitive proposals.  Any responsible firm that feels it has the capability to provide this requirement and has similar capabilities and resources as Accuity may respond in writing no later than September 18, 2006, with capability statements and information describing in full detail their capabilities to accomplish SSA???s objec!ive.  Additionally, respondents should cite specific examples of their experience in detecting unreported depository accounts at financial institutions using the customer???s name and social security number as the identifying information.  Interested parties that feel they can provide these services shall respond by submitting their capability statement by e-mail to Kathryn.fain@ssa.gov.  All responses shall be marked CAPABILITY STATEMENT ??? FINANCIAL INSTITUTION VERIFICATION.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with negotiations with Accuity.  Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

Additional banding such a Q-,C-, and NOR will be performed, when required at no additional cost. The Laboratory must be licensed by the State of Tennessee. Personnel assigned by the contractor to perform the services covered by this contract shall be licensed in a State, Territory, or Commonwealth of the United States or the District of Columbia. The qualifications of such personnel shall also be subject to review by the VA Chief of Staff and approval by the VA Facility Director. In accordance with applicable confidentiality laws, copies of clinical or other medical records of VA beneficiaries treated by the contractor will be forwarded to VA. Protocol for chromosome analysis in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes: I. Samples Studied: Bone Marrow aspirates, peripheral bloods or spleen samples are provided to the cytogenetic laboratory with a requisition form describing the tentative diagnosis. In cases of ANNL, CML, and MDS chromosome preparation is done for all samples. In cases of lymphocytic leukemia a direct preparation as well as a preparation after one to three days' cultures are done. These multiple analysis are done because culture is required to detect some anomalies after an overnight culture. II. Cultures, Harvesting, and Chromosome Preparation Techniques: Collect 1-3 mls of samples in a sodium heparin tube (green top) Add 2 mls of Hanks balanced salt solution containing a 2.5 ug of colcemid/ml and 4 mls of Hank's balanced salt solution to a sterile 15 ml Corning graduated tube. Add 1.0 ml of sample to colcemid in corning tube. Mix gently. Leave at room temperature for 45 minutes. After colcemid treatment, spin tube at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes and decant supernatant. Add 1.0 ml of prewarmed 0.56 M KCI (0.56 g KCL/100 ml H20), and suspend. Plate tube in 37 C water bath for 25 minutes. Add 1.0 ml fixer (1part flacial acetic acid to 3 parts absolute methanol), and centrifuge. Remove supernatant and add 10 ml. Fresh fixer, suspend and spin. Repeat until button is white. Make cloudy cell suspension. Drop 2-3 drops on precleaned, cold, wet slides and air dry. III. Chromosome Banding Analysis: It should be emphasized that all analytical and recording procedure are in accordance with the Southeastern Cancer Study Group Protocol (see attached). Trypsin-giemsa or quinacrine banding is employed to identify the chromosomes. The first 20 cells encountered are analyzed without selection for the quality of the metaphase. This procedure is necessary to avoid laboratory bias because chromosomes from leukemic cells have fuzzier morphology than the chromosomes from normal cells prepared in the same marrow, from these metaphases the number and type of abnormalities in the leukemic cells are identified. The numerical and structural anomalies of each cell studies are noted in the analysis sheet. Photographs of at least 3 cells are taken if all cells are normal. When an abnormal cell is observed it is photographed. For each abnormal cell line at least two cells are photographed. IV. Karyotyping Two karyotypes of normal cells and at least one for every abnormal cell line is prepared according to the International System for Cytogenetic nomenclature (1985). V. Reporting: Copies of mounted karyotypes of normal and abnormal cell lines are sent to the referring physician. Included in this report are the number of cells analyzed and the number of karytypes prepared. Numerical and structural correlation and the prognostic significance are provided with appropriate references. It should be noted that all studies are done under the supervision and are reviewed by multiple physicians certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics. Furthermore, the Director of the clinical cytogenetics laboratory is on the Review and Quality Control Committee of the Southeast Regional Genetics Group (Maternal Child Health Region VIII). For quality assurance procedures: Should results of worksheets not be reproducible and this can be proven by the Government; the Government may terminate this contract with the contractor. The effective termination date will be the date of termination. The contractor will only be paid for test performed up to the date of termination.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517310.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of the Director, Office of Dietary Supplement (ODS), has a requirement for the administration of the Bioactive Food Components initiative, and intergovernmental efforts aimed at developing systematic approaches to identify, categorize, and assess the potential health effects of bioactive components in foods and dietary supplements.  To the best of the Government?s knowledge, Leila G.

In addition to the above, Dr. Saldanha will be responsible for 1) priority setting for development and validation of dietary supplement analytical methods.  The consultant will gather information about priorities for method development and validation from industry sources, Federal agencies, and other interested parties, and would work with NIH to integrate these into the priorities of the existing program, develop educational materials on governmental, non-profit, and for-profit groups involved in developing and setting standards, and monitoring the quality of dietary supplements; 2) work with ODS to publish the seventh issue of the Annual Bibliography of Significant Advances in Dietary Supplement Research; 3) assist with outreach activities to external stakeholder groups, such as planning and organization of scientific sessions at professional and trade meetings; and 4) assist in the development of the Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database program.

For these reasons, and the fact that Dr. Saldanha has been a consultant for three years and has initiated projects that have taken on new dimensions, and has the ability to work independently with minimal guidance, it is believed that Dr. Saldanha is uniquely qualified to provide the needed services.  This acquisition is less than the simplified acquisition threshold.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.

All responses received prior to the due date above will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition will be based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Selection of another source could cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling ODS? mission of completing the first phase of the bioactive food components initiative, strengthening the knowledge and understanding of dietary supplements by evaluating scientific information, stimulating and supporting research, disseminating research results, and educating the public.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  It is anticipated that the Request for Quotation will be available 12 days after the publication of this synopsis.  The period of performance is 1 year from date of award for a total of approximately 1000 hours.    Quotes will be due 5 days after the release of the RFQ.

<DESC>This modification provides answers to questions received on the above solicitation. Consequently, Section C is modified to include these responses. Question 1: In Section C, page 5, number 12 "contractor must be able to modify the existing equipment either at time of award or after award" to be a carbonated filling system. Answer: The Carbonated Filling System is an optional item. Consequently, proposals should identify if this is an available option. The proposal should also include the additional equipment and associated pricing information necessary for this type of operation. Question 2: In Section C, page 3, number 5, item l. "peristaltic pump 1 head runs thin and medium viscosities". This type of pump can effectively run your specified products and cannot be upgraded to handle carbonated liquids. Using this pump it's not a standard filling method for these types of products in production environments. Peristaltic pumps are typically used in small laboratories etc and you should see http://www.coleparmer.com/techinfo/techinfo.asp?openlist=D,E,C&htmlfile=NyrenDispense.htm&Title=Search for more information. Answer: See Response to Question 1. Company's proposal shall reflect how their system's components will meet the specifications identified in Section C (as modified). Question 3: Are bottle drawings and neck finish sizes available? Answer: Neck Sizes are not available. We will use standard or most popular, commercially available bottles for juices. Question 4: Is neck handling an option? Answers: No. The system requires neck handling which must be adjustable for different sizes of necks. Question 5: If glass and plastic you will need base register and different closure capabilities. 
Answer: Yes, However, it will depend on the size of bottles. Ideally the based register and closure could be flexible or changeable for handling both glass and plastic, depending on the size of the bottle. Question 6: Closures for glass need to be identified. Answer: Closures for glass shall be similar to plastic bottles. Question 7: Will this be running dairy products as 3A spec would mean? Answer: Yes. 3-A is sanitary standards and accepted practices for the sanitary design, fabrication, installation and cleanability of dairy and food equipment or systems used to handle, process and package consumable products where a high degree of sanitation is required. For processors, conforming to 3-A Sanitary Standards means they are in compliance with applicable sanitary codes for equipment construction. Processors also can be assured that with equipment meeting 3-A Sanitary Standards, they can apply the most modern cleaning and sanitizing methods, materials and systems to in-plant operations. For equipment manufacturers, it means equipment fabricated in conformance to 3-A Sanitary Standards will receive universal acceptance from processors and sanitarians. For example, the materials must be FDA approved, resistant to high temperature, acid, alkaline, no dead spot for cleaning, etc. More information on 3-A SSI can be found at http://www.3-a.org/. Question 8: It is assumed all contact areas will be 316 SS. Answer: Yes, or an FDA approved materials for food if Stainless Steel is not possible.  Also see response to Question 7.  Question 9: Please provide more information around CIP and SIP requirements. Answer: CIP: clean in place - Used for cleaning the system after production; chemical detergents and acid/alkaline involved. SIP: sterilization in place - Used for sterilizing the system (food contact parts).  High temperature water or steam involved. In place means that the system should not be disassembled for cleaning each parts. Question 10: Is a rinser part of our scope? Answer: Yes. Refer to Section C.1(o) and Section C.3. Question 11: Gas purge refers to a snift. This implies a pressure fill which requires valve contact which is non-aeseptic. Answer:  No direct contact is required, and it is not necessary to use a valve for gas purge. Question 12:  Capper can have quick change chucks but need to confirm closures for glass versus plastic. Answer: The capper should handle both glass and plastic in the same size. The capper may be changeable for different sizes of caps. Refer to Section C.5. Question 13:   Item "s" makes two conflicting statements. Which is correct? Answer:  5 gallons. Specification Section C.5(s) is revised to delete reference to '2 gallon'. Question 14: Will induction closure be inside closure or a separate application? Answer: No.  The induction closure has to be inside. Question 15: Need a better description of products to be run. Is there a matrix available? Answer: No matrix is available.  However, the products may include any liquid foods, from drink water (low viscosity) to liquid egg (high viscosity), or juice with purees. All other information remains unchanged.  Responses are due on SEPTEMBER 21, 2006 by 1:00 p.m. local time, to the USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Contracting Office, 600 East Mermaid Lane, Wyndmoor, PA 19038.

<SUBJECT>A -- Ultra Light Dropsonde System
<SOLNBR>RA133R-06-RP-0180

<CONTACT>Susan Labovitz, Contract Specialist, Phone (303) 497-7943, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email susan.labovitz@noaa.gov - Susan Labovitz, Contract Specialist, Phone (303) 497-7943, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email susan.labovitz@noaa.gov
<DESC>This is Amendment 1 to the RFP.  Seven questions were asked about the Request for Proposal.  Responses are being provided below to all potential offers. 

Question 1:  The RFI for the Ultra Light Dropsonde included a goal that dropsondes weigh no more than 20 grams each.  There is no mention of this goal in the RFP.  Request the Government provide insight into its current goals regarding dropsonde weight.  If the goal is the same, request the rationale for omitting the goal from the RFP.

Response:  Information gathered during market research and from responses to the RFI convinced the Government that a 20 gram dropsonde was probably beyond the current state-of-the-art.  It was decided that a less risky approach to achieving the main goal of an Ultra-light Dropsonde System would be to let offerors tell what weight of dropsonde they could deliver and rate the proposals on that (among other items).  

 

Question 2:  Section C 4.2.1 Performance Requirements, calls for 2-way communication from the ground station to the ORDP.  What capability is envisioned for transmitting from the ground station to the ORDP?

Response:  The government envisions that this link might be used to issue a command to release a dropsonde or to modify the schedule for automatically releasing dropsondes, in addition to other uses.  



Question 3:  Section C 4.1.3 Operational Environment, specifies a 12-V DC power supply requirement for the ORDP.  What is the anticipated function of this requirement?

Response:  The anticipated function is to provide power to the various components of the ORDP including data processing, and communication equipment.  It may also be used to provide heat if needed.

 

Question 4:  The amount of money budgeted for this program as detailed in the RFP seems inconsistent with the original intent in the RFI to design and develop a proof-of-concept system.  Requirements for documentation, configuration management, specifications, drawings, parts list, etc. also suggest that suitable components (sondes, ORDP, and ground station) already exist and can only be incrementally changed within the anticipated budget.  Is the Government seeking development of new technology or slight modification of existing technology?

Response:  The Government is seeking development of an Ultra-light Dropsonde System comprising both new technology and possible modifications to possibly existing technology.  For example, new technology may be employed to achieve extremely light-weight packages.  Suitable modifications of existing technology may be used for radio transmitters and receivers and for data processing.  Suitable modifications to existing technology may be used for displays at the ground station.



Question 5:  Section C Articles 4.4 Documentation and 4.5 Logistics include requirements that are normally associated with programs at much later stages of technology development.  Why has the Government included these requirements in an R&D development type contract?

Response:  The Government views the Ultra-light Dropsonde System as a possible initial step toward achieving an operational system to make direct in-situ atmospheric measurements over vast oceanic areas presently not routinely observed with in-situ techniques.  For this initial step to grow and become an operational system, it must be well documented and have the start of logistic support.  The Government feels that documentation and logistics are more effective when they are included at the start of a process rather than being an add-on at some later point.  



Question 6:  Section L.2(B) Prices, indicates the Government has $200,000  budgeted for this effort.  What is the likelihood that additional funds will be allocated if a proposed solution is not within the $200K budget?

Response:  At this point (late summer, 2006) there is $200,000 available for this effort.  As things stand now, the Government would not be able to award a contract for the Ultra-light Dropsonde System effort if there are no proposed solutions within the existing budget.  The many existing and ongoing factors regarding future federal government needs and associated budgets preclude any accurate estimation of possible additional funds.
 


Question 7:  Will a technically noncompliant proposal (that shows a credible pathway to a complete solution) within the $200K budget be scored higher than a fully compliant technical proposal that exceeds the budget?

Response:  The Government will award the contract to the highest ranked technically compliant proposal that is within the budget. If there are no technically compliant proposals within the budget, then the Government will cancel the acquisition and reevaluate the approach.

<DESC>CLARIFICATION OF PROPOSAL BONDING REQUIREMENTS. The Standard Form 1442 indicates in block 13.B that an offer guarantee is required (not to exceed 20% of total bid amount). This has caused potential confusion because this is a two-part selection process, and the Proposal Bond requirement applies to Part 2 of the Source Selection process. Section 00110 explains the Pro Forma requirements for both Part 1 and Part 2 as follows:  PART 1 - PERFORMANCE CAPABILITY PROPOSAL, TAB A  Part 1 Pro Forma Requirements.  This Part 1 requirement calls for: Evidence of Bonding Capacity: Submit a letter of commitment from a surety, signed by an officer or agent authorized to bond, that identifies the offerors available bonding capacity and limits that the surety will bond th e Offeror, as the successful awardee for this project, taking into consideration the Cost Ceiling Limitation described in this Solicitation.  PART 2B - PRICE PROPOSAL, TAB A  Part 2 Pro Forma Requirements.  This Part 2 requirement calls for the submission of an actual Proposal Bond, along with other Pro Forma requirements.  The point of clarification is that the offer guarantee (Proposal Bond) is a Part 2 requirement only. For Part 1, the only bond requirement is the evidence of bonding capacity as described above.

It is the G overnments intent to consider awarding all or part of this acquisition under the authority of the 8(a) Program (see FAR 19.8), the HUBZone Program (see FAR 19.13), and/or the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Procurement Program (see FAR 19.14) .  The Government will review the responses as a result of this notice in order to determine if the acquisition should be set-aside for one or more of the designated concerns previously identified.  Any 8(a), HUBZone, or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned conc ern that meets the minimum requirements identified within this announcement may indicate its interest to propose as a prime contractor for this acquisition whereby the work will be performed either (1) 100% by the concern or (2) at least 15% performed by t he concern and the remaining work subcontracted.  If a single 8(a), HUBZone, or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned concern lacks the necessary capacity or capability to perform the contract on its own, a teaming arrangement (i.e. two or more companies forming a teaming arrangement or joint venture to act as a potential prime contractor) is permissible provided the arrangements are identified and company relationships are fully disclosed and found to be in accordance with federal regulations.  The rules governin g the 8(a) Program teaming arrangements/joint ventures are described in the Code of Federal Regulations at 13 CFR 124.513.  The rules governing the HUBZone Program teaming arrangements/joint ventures are described in 13 CFR 126.616.

The Contractor may be required to survey the problem areas, evaluate and recommend solutions, develop and implement work plans in a timely manner within negoti ated costs, and provide the repair/renewal/construction efforts to support the design solution.  At times, the Contractor may be required to provide stand alone construction efforts without the provision of the associated services (i.e. site investigation,  work plan, etc.).  Task orders may be awarded for work to be performed through-out the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and all US territories, for the following Government agencies:  Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Veteran s Administration, State Department, Department of Interior, Department of Energy and Department of Transportation.

OCONUS requirements are a minima l percentage of the work to be performed under this acquisition.  Upon analysis of the responses, it will be determined if companies are interested only in task  orders performed in the United States or if they are capable in addition to perform in overseas locations.  Task order awards may be firm fixed-price and/or time and materials.  The NAICS code for this program is 236220, Commercial & Institutional Buildin g Construction.

<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Clinical Imager Retrieval Systems Inc. (CIR Systems Inc.), of Parsippany, New Jersey, for the purchase of a GAITRite Portable Gait System, for equipment associated with the National Rehabilitation, Polytrauma Program, for the Edward Hines Jr., VA Hospital, Hines, Illinois.   Based upon research conducted, in connection with this requirement, CIR Systems Inc., supplies the only truly portable electronic walkway in the world.  The GAITRite System performs with the use of a roll-up carpet, 1/8 thick, containing 36,864 sensors in our 32-foot model. The GAITRite System comes in a wheeled carrying case that fits in most automobile trunks or rear seats.  The standard carpet is 14 long and custom lengths are available up to 32 feet.  The walkway can be laid over any flat surface.  The system requires minimal setup and test time.  The system requires no placement of any devices on the patient.  The hardware does not require and internal A-D board to be installed in the computer. The GAITRite walkway communicates with the serial/com port of the personal computer.  The serial port interface of the GAITRite enables data acquisition of other instruments to occur simultaneously along with the GAITRite; all on the same computer.  In addition, the GAITRite software can be installed on an infinite number of computers, allowing for the ultimate in flexibility in both testing and analysis.  The GAITRite has its own patient database. Thus allowing for seamless storage and retrieval of patient information. The GAITRite offers a peer-reviewed scientific literature normal values database. The GAITRite offers a user defined normal values database. The GAITRite offers comparisons to either of these normal values. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302 - only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy agency requirements. NAICS 334510.  To the best of our knowledge, CIR Systems Inc., of Parsippany, New Jersey is the only source that provides the subject equipment and type system, which includes the above indicated items and features.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is conducting a market survey for a contract to collect and analyze data related to health services utilization by persons with HIV infection during CY 2006-2008.  It is anticipated that only one award will be made.  This contract will continue support for the HIV Research Network, which is currently supported by a contract that will end on September 30, 2006.
Sources must demonstrate that they have access to data from medical records from a number of different providers of HIV care in different regions of the U.S.  The current HIV Research Network has obtained patient-level data from 17 different HIV care provider sites;  to maintain the scope of the project, sources must show that they can obtain data from at least 17 HIV clinical sites across the U.S..  At least one provider must be in each of the four U.S. Census regions.  The current HIV Research Network has developed a longitudinal database that covers the years 2000-2005.  Sources must demonstrate not only that they will be able to collect data for CY 2006-2008, but also that they can merge these data at the patient level with comparable data for CY 2003-2005, to maintain the longitudinal aspect of the database.
Each participating data provision site will abstract information from medical records of patients receiving care for HIV infection at that site.  Data will be abstracted on an annual basis, at a minimum, and submitted to a Data Coordinating Center by July of the following year.  To maintain continuity with data gathered under the current HIVRN contract, sites will provide data on all data elements currently collected by the HIVRN:  1) demographic characteristics, including insurance coverage;  2)clinical information, including results of CD4 and viral load tests and diagnoses of comorbidities; 3) inpatient admissions, including length of stay and discharge diagnoses;  4) outpatient visits, including visit dates and CPT codes; 5) ER episodes, including whether the ER visit resulted in an inpatient admission;  6) detailed information on antiretroviral medications prescribed, including start and stop dates; 7) and information on mental illness and substance abuse, including diagnoses and receipt of mental health or substance abuse treatment. 
Sources must have an understanding of and, preferably, experience in, health services research. Sources must also possess clinical expertise in the current treatments for HIV infection.  Sources must have experience in data processing and cleaning, developing large longitudinal databases, as well as expertise in multivariate statistical analysis of clinical and resource utilization data.
Interested organizations capable of performing the above and with the requisite qualifications and expertise should submit, no later than March 1, 2006, a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet AHRQs requirements as described above.  Capability statement should be no longer than 10 pages and may include appendices for resumes, etc.  Capability statements should be submitted electronically to Sharon Williams at swilliam@ahrq.gov or hard copies (original and two copies) may be sent by mail to Sharon Williams, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 540 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD  20850.  Capability statements received after March 1, 2006, will not be reviewed nor considered.  A determination by the Government to compete or not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of AHRQ.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation or Request for Proposal document is currently available.

<CONTACT>Doris Turner, Purchasing Agent, Phone (303) 497-3872, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email doris.p.turner@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Weather Service (NWS) is conducting market research for the replacement of the Optical Encoder in its NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radar WSR-88D. The Optical Encoder provides elevation and azimuth position information for the WSR-88D antenna/pedestal assembly and is contained within the pedestal. The existing Optical Encoder is approaching obsolescence of its critical components. The existing Optical Encoder is model A1625H-14NB manufactured by Sequential Electronics Systems, Inc. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from Encoder manufacturers relating to the availability of compatible Optical Encoders in the commercial market. The following are the pertinent characteristics of the existing Optical Encoder.

The Optical Encoder provides an output consisting of a 14 Bit (0.02 degree) resolution, 13 Bit (0.04 degree) accuracy providing absolute angle data in a serial natural binary format with the Least Significant Bit (LSB) first out.  A bite bit of Logic "1" in the Most Significant Bit (MSB) + 1 indicating normal operation and a Logic "0" to indicate an encoder failure.  A binary "1" is indicated by a minimum of 2.5 VDC at -20 mA. A binary "0" is indicated by a maximum of 0.5 VDC at 20 mA.

The inputs (read,clock) must have differential input impedance of 180 ohms minimum, a pulse width minimum of 0.5 micro-sec, an interrogation rate minimum of 5 kHz, a shift frequency minimum of 2.0 MHz. The rotation, for increasing count, should be clockwise facing the mounting surface or shaft end.  Power should be +5 Vdc +0.25/-0.50 Vdc at 1500 mA maximum.

The mechanical data should include solid shaft, self-contained electronics, and a starting/running torque of 1.5 oz-in maximum (@ 25 degrees C).

Once the encoder receives the read pulse, the time to the first data bit output (LSB) should not exceed 104 micro-seconds.

GENERAL: The NWS will not fund the development of a new design to support this requirement.  Responses to this market survey should only include products that support all stated requirements in a current commercially available configuration, or could be made fully compliant through minor modifications.  Responses to this market survey must include the device manufacturer, a product description with performance parameters, a statement regarding current availability, a statement describing any required modifications, and the estimated cost of the product including any required modifications. These cost estimates must include any non-recurring costs along with the cost for manufacture of 400 production units. This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes. The NWS will use the results of this RFI to estimate expected cost and identify possible sources to support this future requirement. All information should be submitted to the following: Doris Turner, U.S. Dept. of Commerce/NOAA/ Mountain Region Acquisition Division, Fax: 303-497-3163 or e-mail: doris.p.turner@noaa.gov.  Responses should be received no later than 30 days from the date of this announcement.

<DESC>Contracting Office:  Missile Defense Agency, (MDA), Contracts Directorate; 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC, 20301-7100

Description:  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking potential sources to provide nationwide marketing and recruiting services for a variety of professional science, engineering, and business disciplines.  MDA is looking for support from an organization that is both knowledgeable of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the federal personnel management hiring process, and is experienced with implementing recruitment programs for attracting qualified applicants.

Background:  The Missile Defense Agency is a separate agency of the DoD under the direction, authority, and control of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics).  The Agency manages, directs, and executes the ballistic missile defense program with the following mission: define, develop and acquire BMD architectures with the systems, subsystems, and components needed to defend the U.S., deployed forces, allies, and friends; employ an integrated system that layers defenses to intercept missiles in all phases of their flight (i.e., boost, midcourse, and terminal) against all ranges of threats; and enable the Military Services to field elements of the overall Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) as soon as practicable.  To achieve this mission, the Agency is developing and testing technologies, using prototype and test assets to provide early capability, and improving the effectiveness of our deployed capabilities by inserting new technologies as they become available or when the threat warrants an accelerated capability.

Requirements:  As a result of this technologically challenging national defense mission, the Agency has an immediate and continuous need for a variety of professional disciplines.  Accordingly, MDA needs to recruit nationwide for qualified applicants in the following occupational job series:

?X	Internships (available in all professional series)
?X	Mid-level staff (with undergraduate training and less than 10 years experience)
?X	Senior-level staff  (with graduate training and more than 10 years experience)  

Communicating the Agency??s current and future employment needs requires a comprehensive and substantial recruitment program that uses a full spectrum of services to identify potential markets, target audiences, and disseminate information and employment opportunities.  The scope of this program effort should include:

?X	Marketing Research?Xcoordinate, schedule, and facilitate focus groups; conduct interviews; and assess current print and multimedia materials and program strategies.
	
?X	Communications Planning?Xdevelop contemporary communication goals, objectives, and strategies for all target audiences and customers; monitor, measure and evaluate the communication plans and programs?? effectiveness.
  
?X	Advertising?Xprepare plans; develop budget recommendations, negotiate costs; identify and execute ad placements; assess pre-and post-buy effectiveness; monitor print, radio, television, Internet, or other mass media commercials, announcements, banners, or related electronically disseminated information.   

?X	Print and Multimedia Materials?Xdevelop, draft, and publish brochures, posters, direct mail, and electronic mail messages or announcements.

?X	Public Relations?Xevaluate overall program effectiveness and strategies and reinforce, adjust, or clarify information and message through media planning, developing and producing press kits and news releases, and publishing articles in appropriate professional journals, newspapers, Web sites, or other sources.

?X	Event Planning?XIdentify best value trade shows, exhibitions and conferences; manage, facilitate, and provide logistics support for attending job fairs, college recruitment activities, and international and national special events.

<DESC>Background

In March of 2006 the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced his intention to establish a dedicated strategic planning function in HHS that more efficiently integrates biodefense requirements, across the full range of threat agents, with the execution of advanced development and procurement of medical countermeasures. HHS will work to make the current BioShield interagency governance process more transparent and work to educate industry about HHS priorities and opportunities. To meet this objective, HHS created the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMC Enterprise), (published in the Federal Register in July 2006), which under the coordination of OPHEMC, will: 1) define and prioritize requirements for public health emergency medical countermeasures; 2) coordinate research, early- and late-stage product development and procurement activities to address these requirements; and 3) set deployment and use strategies for medical countermeasures held in the Strategic National Stockpile. The PHEMC Enterprise incorporates a broad approach to preparedness from effective surveillance/detection of threats to the research, development, acquisition, storage/maintenance, deployment and effective utilization of medical countermeasures.
  
Additionally, HHS is undertaking a two-staged approach to develop a STRATEGY that will lead to an IMPLEMENTATION PLAN for medical countermeasures to address chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) threats. The HHS Strategy details the principles, priority policy issues, and strategic objectives for developing and acquiring the most appropriate medical countermeasures for the highest priority CBRN threats facing our nation. On September 8, 2006, the draft ?Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Strategy for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Threats? was published in the Federal Register (Vol 71 No. 174) for public comment.
 
The HHS Implementation Plan will be a prioritized plan with near-, mid- and long-term goals for research, development and acquisition of medical countermeasures that is consistent with the guiding principles and priority-setting criteria, as defined in the final HHS Strategy.
 
Description

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.
 
Data obtained from this RFI will provide critical inputs to the HHS Implementation Plan, with the ultimate goal to acquire the most appropriate medical countermeasures for mitigating the health effects from the highest priority CBRN threats facing the nation.
 
OPHEMC is responsible for coordinating, supporting and providing leadership and expert advice with respect to public health medical countermeasure late stage advanced development and procurement. To this end, the Federal Government is interested in identifying and characterizing the current and projected status of the research and development programs related to CBRN medical countermeasures. Within this class of public health emergency medical countermeasures, the Federal Government is especially interested in medical countermeasures or diagnostic devices that could be readily deployed and used in preparation for, or response to, a CBRN event. Product attributes that facilitate this objective include, but are not limited to products that are single dose, self-administered, have demonstrated efficacy within a window of opportunity consistent with public health emergency response, limited or no cold chain requirements for storage, and a long shelf life. Diagnostic devices that are point of care and able to be rapidly deployed are of special interest. Medical countermeasures that address the following threats are of particular interest:

Biological  
Category A, as defined by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp)
o	Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis)
o	Botulism (Clostridium botulinum toxin) 
o	Plague (Yersinia pestis) 
o	Smallpox (variola major) 
o	Tularemia (Francisella tularensis) 
o	Viral hemorrhagic fevers (filoviruses [e.g., Ebola, Marburg] and arenaviruses [e.g., Lassa, Machupo])

Category B - (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp)
o	Brucellosis (Brucella species) 
o	Epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens
o	Food safety threats (e.g., Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella)
o	Glanders (Burkholderia mallei)
o	Meliodosis(Burkholderia pseudomallei)
o	Psittacosis (Chlamydia psittaci) 
o	Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) 
o	Ricin toxin from Ricinus communis (castor beans)
o	Staphylococcal enterotoxin B
o	Typhus fever (Rickettsia prowazekii)
o	Viral encephalitis (alphaviruses [e.g., Venezuelan equine encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis])
o	Water safety threats (e.g., Vibrio cholerae, Cryptosporidium parvum)

Category C (http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/agentlist-category.asp)
o	Emerging infectious diseases such as Nipah virus and hantavirus

Chemical
Nerve agents, chemicals that affect the respiratory tract, and cellular/metabolic poisons.

Radiological/Nuclear 
Radiological or nuclear agents that cause acute radiation syndrome and/or the delayed effects of radiation exposure.  

In order to assess the maturity of each medical countermeasure program or medical diagnostic device, Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), Appendices 1-4 are to be used as a reference to gauge the stage of development of each medical countermeasure program, which will aid in comparisons among different projects and across different companies. Please refer to the TRL level of your program(s) in the cover letter of the submission. Appendices included are:

Appendix 1- Technology Readiness Levels For Biological Medical Countermeasures
Appendix 2 - Technology Readiness Levels For Chemical Medical Countermeasures
Appendix 3 - Technology Readiness Levels For Radiological and Nuclear Medical Countermeasures
Appendix 4 - Technology Readiness Levels For Medical Diagnostics Devices Countermeasures
  
Interested organizations that have candidate products are invited to submit capability statements to HHS. Submitted information should include: a) a description of the candidate product including relevant chemical, physical chemical or immunological characteristics; b) a description of the mechanism of action; c) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; d) information regarding the stage of product development, including, but not limited to: preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies, e) nature and status of assay and animal model development; f) an estimate of production capacity complying with applicable regulations on Current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP); and g) integrated project plans and timelines that incorporate manufacturing, regulatory, clinical and non-clinical tasks/actions to move the candidate product from development to approval, licensure, or clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (including studies to meet Animal Rule requirements, if product approval or licensure will be sought under 21 CFR Part 314, Subpart I or 21 CFR Part 601, Subpart H, respectively).
  
All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant Federal law. Information must be submitted by 3pm, October 31, 2006. Responses should be limited to 25 pages. Data sets (e.g., tables, charts, graphs) and documents which are pertinent to the response can be submitted as appendices to the primary submission. Electronic format is required and can be e-mailed to the attention of the primary contact person: Contracting Officer Darrick (Andre) Early, email:darrick.early@hhs.gov.

<DESC>The VA Connecticut Healthcare System intends to negotaite a sole procurement with Medisafe America regarding a Sonic Irrigator Auto (Complete System). This system is used to surface wash reusable patient care/surgical instruments to remove body fluids and bone. This auto system allows efficient and consistent cleaning of instruments that the current washing by hand does not. Instruments can not be effectively sterilzed until they are thoroughly cleaned. Hand washing with use of brushes and reamers shortens the life of the instruments and ceaning effectiveness varies with the thoroughness of the person cleaning. It is therefore imperative that VA Connecticut procure said system in order to get more life out of surgical instruments and render the instruments ready for sterilization. Medisafe is the only known manufacturer/distributor of cannulated surgical instrument cleaning systems combining  enzyme injection, sonic action, cannulated pulse enhancement with independent irrigation of up to 18 insyruments in one automated process. This procurement is under the authority of FAR 6.302.  A determination based upon responses to this notice is soley within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered soley for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See note 22

Statement of Work (SOW) is as follows:

STATEMENT OF WORK
 SUPPORTING THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE
BUDGET INFORMATION SYSTEMS (SAF/FMPTB)
1.  OVERVIEW  
1.1.  Mission
Support the ongoing Budget Information Systems (BIS) requirements through the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) by providing continuous improvements to all BIS software systems and related functional areas.  Our goal is to provide quality support, combined with full documentation of user needs.  Our mission is accomplished through:
?	Professional program management and decision analysis techniques 
?	State-of-the-art training using the latest technology to reach the maximum audience
?	Development, implementation, testing, and monitoring of upgraded systems
?	Quality methods, techniques, and state-of-the-art procedures with professional personnel
1.2.  Vision
Our vision is to forge new pathways and techniques to improve Financial Management and Budgeting (FMB) methods; to continuously enhance the knowledge and functional performance of all financial and budgeting personnel; and to provide a rich resource of dedicated professionals and innovative technologies capable of ensuring these possibilities in the 21st century. 
1.3.  Scope
This Statement of Work (SOW) represents services needed to support a ?proof of concept? that has been agreed upon jointly between SAF/FMPT and OSD Defense Business Transformation Agency (BTA).
1.4 Background
Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) was established in 2006 as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed through and across the DoD and to streamline and modernize existing, disparate funds distribution systems.  The EFD initiative has the potential to provide significant substantive improvements in the Financial Visibility Business Enterprise Priority (BEP).  However, key to the EFD approach is the involvement of the stakeholder community to drive business requirements and to validate the enterprise-wide funds distribution solution.
While the primary purpose of the EFD initiative is to transform funds management at the enterprise-level of the Department, the following EFD objectives lead to significantly enhanced funds distribution capabilities:
?	Provide full visibility of appropriated funds as they pass through and across different levels of the enterprise;
?	Streamline funds distribution processes for all DoD appropriations and standardize funds distribution data across the enterprise;
?	Automate audit trail between president?s budget submission and appropriations enactments;
?	Automate and integrate funds authorization documents (FADs), track funds reprogrammed, and electronically track funds distributed for execution.

The Enterprise Funds Distribution solution will provide a web-based application for the pre-planning, apportionment, reprogramming, rescission, continuing resolution, and reporting of enterprise-level funds control and distribution of appropriated funding for the DoD.  The EFD solution will minimize duplication of core capabilities across Components and provides visibility both vertically (echelon levels) and horizontally (enterprise-wide).  Middle-ware services will provide integration to legacy funds distribution systems until full migration to the core solution.  Additional services allow for the assignment of the Organization Unique Identifier (OUID) at the budget execution phase as part of wide-area workflow.  

2.  DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Description of Work
A ?proof-of-concept? project is required to test the viability of using an existing GOTS system to satisfy the basic set of EFD requirements using several accounts.  A key objective of the proof-of-concept project is to validate and prioritize a set of to-be functional requirements and to validate a shared operational concept capable of handling the complexity of an enterprise-level funds distribution solution, i.e. Comptroller requirement for incorporating SFIS codes as well as the requirement to track by BA/BSA and/or budget line item number depending on the appropriation.
The Business Transformation Agency and OUSD(C) personnel have designed multiple test scenarios using FY06 data and developed a set of evaluation criteria to review the set of known funds distribution requirements against an existing Department GOTS funds distribution system. 
This includes funds control based upon Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) rules for consistent, common accounting practices.  Key to this proof-of-concept will be the review of multiple appropriated funds accounts to include Military Construction, Military Personnel, Procurement, O&M, RDT&E, and Treasury Index Funds & Working Capital Funds.  In addition, the Military Construction account spans multiple-year appropriations and multiple project codes.
A key outcome of the proof-of-concept project is the identification of modifications needed to close identified gaps between the validated set of requirements (including access control) and the existing GOTS system.  Specific enterprise-level funds distribution capabilities being reviewed include but are not limited to the following:
?	Data visibility to the echelon II level;
?	Process integration between funds distribution with budget formulation and budget execution;
?	Automate audit trail between president?s budget submission and appropriations enactments to include tracing Congressional marks;
?	Automate and integrate funds authorization documents (FADs), track funds reprogrammed, and electronically track funds distributed for execution;
?	Standardized funds allocation and distribution processes;
Results of the proof-of-concept project will support the completion of a gap analysis between the Automated Funds Management (AFM) system and Program Budget Accounting System (PBAS). The EFD workgroup will be used to review GAP analysis. The analysis will also identify the historical and current PBAS data required to be converted in the transition of those data to the EFD. Additional responsibilities will include the review and approval of required Acquisition documentation for the EFD solution.
The EFD proof-of-concept project will span approximately six months beginning June, 2006 and includes support requirements for 3 functional analysts, 2 database analysts, and 1 systems administrator.   These personnel will work the requirements gap analysis between AFM and the EFD concept of operations to be business processes and operational environment.  In addition they will work the systems administration to allow the OSD personnel access to loaded appropriations in the existing AFM database.
The proof-of-concept tests will include:

Uploading PB information into AFM
Congressional Tracking
Creation of DD1414, 1415, and 1416b reports
Creation of FADs
Passing funds from OSD to Echelon 2
Importing distributions into AFM from excel spreadsheets
Creation of Reports

The appropriations in the test include:

	Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide, 97-0100
	Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Defense-Wide, 97-0400
	Other Procurement, Army, 21-2035
	Military Construction, Navy, 17-1205
Military Personnel, Air Force, 57-3500
	National Guard Personnel, AF, 57-3850
2.2 Required Reports
The contractor is to provide monthly reports showing hours expended and denote major accomplishments.  These reports should be sufficient to track hours and dollars left on the contract and the burn rate associated with the performance from month to month.  Schedule progress, and other types of reports will be completed on an as required basis.  This report is a simple spreadsheet denoting the information requested above.

<SUBJECT>U -- US Air Force Academy Flight Screening Program
<DESC>Industry Week to support US Air Force Academy for the Academy Flight Screening program.

The Air Force anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal for contracted flight screening at the US Air Force Academy (USAFA).  The Air Force intends to conduct an Industry Week during the week of 14-18 August 2006.  During this week, the Air Force will provide briefings explaining in detail the concept of operations of the flight screening program.  This will include tours of the facilities that will be utilized by the future contractor for both operations and maintenance.  Potential offerors will be given the opportunity to present a short (30 minutes or less) briefing to the Air Force highlighting their company capabilities as they pertain to the flight screening program and ask questions of the Air Force concerning the draft Performance Work Statement that will be posted prior to this event.  Most importantly, the Air Force wishes to qualify aircraft for this proposal.  For aircraft to be considered for the flight screening program, capability to meet required standards must be demonstrated during this event.  Due to the unique environmental conditions at the USAFA at this time of year, qualification evaluations can only be conducted during this week.  Offerors on contract flight screening at the Air Force Academy may only propose use of aircraft which have demonstrated the capability to meet the required standards. 

This qualification is to ensure safety by validating aircraft performance and operational capability in the high density altitude environment of the USAFA present during this timeframe.  Evaluation of the aircraft based on standards listed below will be on a pass/fail basis.  Aircraft must meet all standards in order to receive a pass rating.  The pass/fail results of the testing will be provided to the manufacturer/offeror seeking qualification.  A list of aircraft receiving a passing rating will be posted on FedBizOps and included in the forthcoming RFP for flight screening at the USAFA.  

The required standards are as follows: 

Aircraft will be FAA certificated for normal category or higher.  Any new aircraft not previously certified must be certified prior to proposal submission.  
  
Tri cycle gear.

Crosswind:  20 Knots.

Aircraft Weight & Balance:  For Center of Gravity (CG) and maximum takeoff weight considerations: As light as one solo student weighing 113 pounds, as heavy as 277 pounds, or two aircrew weighing a total of 450 pounds (which includes flight suit, boots, and checklists, but does not include survival equipment stored on the aircraft).

Flight duration:  Aircraft must fly two 1.5 hour training sorties plus 30 minutes fuel reserves. The intent is to fly two training missions before refueling. 

Climb rate:  600 feet per minute (FPM) at 10,000' density altitude with 450 pounds of aircrew and the required fuel. 

Climb speed:  Specified climb speed must be at least 10 KIAS above the level-flight stall speed at maximum takeoff weight.

Cruise Speed:  Continuous cruise of at least 125 KTAS at 10,000' density altitude with 450 pounds of aircrew and the required fuel.

Area performance:  Perform a sustained level 45-degree banked turn at 10,000' density altitude with 450 pounds of aircrew and the required fuel.

Aborted takeoff:  At 10,000' density altitude, zero headwind, dry runway, at maximum takeoff weight, accelerate to takeoff speed using normal takeoff procedures, pause three seconds, reduce power to idle, and stop the aircraft using maximum braking within 3500 feet of initiation of takeoff roll.

Aircraft dimensions: Must be able to be maneuvered into available maintenance facilities; maximum measurements 37' 5" length, 39' 8" wingspan, and 9' 10" height 

Aircrew size:  Shall accommodate students 64 inches to 77 inches tall, and sitting heights of 34 inches to 40 inches.

Avionics:  Dual Communication with single VOR Navigation / Mode C reporting transponder, Global Positioning System (GPS) (IFR-certification not required), audio panel and integral intercom.  The aircraft must have some type of traffic alert system like TCAS or a similar system.

<SUBJECT>R -- National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Facilities Management/Consultant Services
<DESC>THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. 

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)  intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Battistello Consulting in Elkridge, Maryland for a five-year contract for Facilities Management/Consultant Services. The primary function of this award will be to utilize an expert consultant to provide timely interaction both written and verbal to the NHLBI on any space/construction related issues.   

The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) coordinates and directs a wide range of activities of basic and clinical scientific research programs within the Division of Intramural Research (DIR).  These activities include research in areas such as heart and vascular disease, normal and abnormal cardiovascular and hematologic physiology, genetic studies, cellular and molecular biology, cell signaling, biophysics and biochemistry and other applied and clinically-related research interests. 

The consultant will provide an intimate knowledge of ongoing relocation/construction/renovation processes that affects the institutes? laboratory facilities.  The expert consultant will provide timely recommendations to the Division of Intramural Research Scientific Director (SD) and the Chief of the Intramural Administrative Management Branch (IAMB) on any space related issues/concerns.  The Scientific Director and the Chief, IAMB will evaluate the recommendations and will make the appropriate decision relative to the information.  
							
Battistello Consulting currently coordinates and manages approximately 24-26 space and facilities projects totaling more than $14M.  Several complemental projects will be initiated within the next year.  These projects total approximately 100,000 square feet.  Battistello Consulting?s expertise and years of experience are invaluable to the successful completion of the ongoing projects.  The firm has been intimately involved with the planning, designing and negotiating  phase of each of these projects.  The Facilities Manager/Consultant will work with the scientists, Project Officers, Project Managers, other institute Facilities Managers and the NIH Space and Facilities Office in completing their current duties. A change to the Facilities Manager?s designation at this time would severely jeopardize the intended outcome of the $14M funding allocated thus far.  The contractor?s current relationship coupled with Battistello Consulting?s years of knowledge and direct experience with NIH and the NHLBI is critical as well as invaluable to the overall success of these projects.    

In order to ensure the timely completion of the ongoing and upcoming tasks, DIR/NHLBI requires the continued assistance of Battistello Consulting to manage, track and monitor these renovations.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Quick Reaction Support process revision on the GPS MAGR 2K Production Contract.
<DESC>Under the existing Miniaturized Airborne GPS Receiver (MAGR) ID/IQ contract (FA880-05-D-0001), the Government has the right to direct the Contractor to perform Quick Reaction Support (QRS) tasks.  When authorized by a specific task statement, the Contractor prepares, assembles, and tests brass-boards, models, mockups, or other incidental items of hardware necessary for accomplishing the QRS.  The Contractor also trouble-shoots and analyzes hardware and software in an effort to determine the root cause of any anomaly(s) under investigation.  The Government and Raytheon are now revising the QRS process on the contract in order to expedite the issuing of QRS tasks.  This acquisition creates an unfunded pool of 2500 labor hours on the existing contract.  Funding will be obligated, as necessary for each individual QRS task.  The pool of 2500 labor hours will have an estimated cost based on an annually negotiated wrap rate (to include subcontracted effort).  The QRS clause will contain two "Options to Increase Quantity".  There will be a unilateral option to increase the annual pool by 100%.  And there will be a bilateral option to increase the pool as necessary.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON SOLE SOURCE BASIS.
The United States Coast Guard (USCG) intends to issue a sole source contract to Megapulse Inc.,  N. Billerica, MA to upgrade and maintain the Accufix 7500 transmitter.  The existing hardware and software is proprietary and only Megapulse Inc., may make the modifications.  The Loran-C re-capitalization requires upgrades to allow transmitter integration with the remainder of the system.  This upgrade will allow the Loran Support Unit (LSU) to move forward with a total system that meets signal performance and reliability needs for enhanced Loran-C.  The contract period of performance will be for one year.  The statutory authority for only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements is 10 U.S.C. 2304?(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  The required services are available from only one responsible source.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposal. No Solicitation documents are available.  See Numbered Note 22.

<SUBJECT>--This replaces the Sept 12 announcement USASNOTE060912008. The Product Manager for Demilitarization seeks industry participation in finding a new approaches to the reduction of conventional ammunition stockpiles.
<DESC>The Product Manager for Demilitarization (PM Demil) seeks industry participation in an initiative to find new approaches to the reduction of conventional ammunition stockpiles that no longer have operational utility for the DOD.  Considerable invento ry is available which is believed to have commercial value.  This RFI is intended to stimulate responses that propose new business arrangements that would allow industry acquisition of existing DOD ammunition for reuse or reclamation of materials that may have other military or commercial applications.  Conventional ammunition is defined as a device charged with explosives, propellants, pyrotechnics, or initiating composition for use in connection with defense or offense, including demolitions.  Certain con ventional ammunition items can be used for training, ceremonial, or non-operational purposes and is included in the demil stockpile.  For demilitarization and disposal purposes, conventional ammunition also includes tactical missiles and large rocket motor s.  Even though the government has an ongoing program for demilitarization of conventional ammunition, the stockpile is growing faster than inventory is being eliminated based on available funding.  With the DOD fully engaged in the War on Terrorism, additiona l funding for standard methods of demilitarization is uncertain.  Therefore the Army, as the DODs single manager for conventional ammunition demilitarization, is interested in finding alternatives that would create viable business opportunities for indust ry while achieving the DODs objective to reduce the stockpile of conventional ammunition products that are no longer needed or are unserviceable.   To better understand the Armys initiative an Industry Day will be held 12 October 2006 at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City at Reagan National Airport, 2799 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia.  Registration will begin promptly at 12:30 PM in the Regency E Ballroom.  The meeting will conclude at 4:30 PM.   The government expects respondents to describe contracting strategies, business processes and technical approaches for consuming or reutilizing selected demil stocks.  Responses that simply reiterate on-going practices will not satisfy this requirement (e. g., extended R&D projects to develop new demil process technology).  Successful respondents must show innovative, non-traditional alternatives based on sound business practices that would eliminate aging conventional ammunition stockpiles and avoid the cos ts to the DOD for its storage and surveillance burden.  The government expects that the contractor will accept delivery at the point of storage.     Non-traditional participants are highly encouraged to respond to this opportunity.    Furthermore, this RFI is open to foreign participation, given the State Department protocols and appropriate security requirements for export of military ammunition can b e satisfied.  Responses to this RFI must be delivered before COB 27 November 2006.  Responses to the RFI will help shape the governments strategy for the disposal of these materials and any subsequent formalized requests for proposal.  Interested parties are encouraged  to use the RFI to provide a general understanding of the disposal strategy to be employed, to ask the important questions that will help them decide the viability of future proposals and to inform the government of the critical elements necessary for a wi nning demil contractual relationship between government and industry.  To the extent possible, the RFI response should indicate by ammunition type the quantity (specific types of munitions may be limited in quantity) desired by year, the methods of disposa l, the acceptance of liability for the material to be transferred, disclosure of any need to use government facilities in the execution of the disposal strategy, and the financial basis for the transaction.   A summary list of candidate munitions that have been initially ident ified by DOD for disposal through this new contracting arrangement may be obtained by contacting Mr. Rich Fuller, HQ JMC, Rock Island, IL: email: richard.fullerjr@us.army.mil, phone number: (309) 782-6306.  Requests for additional technical data will be co nsidered and Unclassified responses will be posted for all potential respondents to review. This is a request for information for planning purposes only.  It is not a solicitation and does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation. Please be advised that the Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement.  Electronic submittals are preferred and should be sent to Ms. Chris Thompson, Procuring Contracting Officer, HQ ASC, Rock Island, IL: email: christine.l.thompson@us.army.mil, phone number (309) 782-4345 and Mr. Ryan Larrison, Contract Specialist, HQ ASC, Rock Island, IL: email: ryan.larrison@us.army.mil, phone number (309) 782-6214.

CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST requires the Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner for use with US visa programs.  For the past few years, fingerprint scanners have been a component of the US Governments biometric initiative to prevent the processing of duplicate applications with altered personal information (name, place of birth, date of birth, etc.) and the subsequent issuance of visas based on fraudulent data.  Recently, the US Congress mandated the capture of all 10 fingerprints of visa applicants for whom US Consular officials receive information that indicates that they may have US law enforcement records.  Traditional fingerprint collection methods employing paper cards and ink are slow and inaccurate.  Due to this factor, the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to enhance and expedite the capture process by making it entirely electronic. In coordination with the FBI, Consular Affairs is scheduled to pilot 10-fingerprint capture at US Consulates in Riyadh and Dharan in September 2006. Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian scanners are required for this project.  They were selected because they have been extensively tested and used by the FBI.  The scanner is the first live scan device to meet the size and functional requirements of the Joint Agency User Group.  The Guardian L SCAN is certified for both civil identification flats and full criminal 10-print rolls and flats, and the image quality complies with the FBI EFTS Appendix F.  Crossmatch L SCAN Guardian Ten Print Fingerprint Reader/Scanner is found to be the most robust and reliable (in terms of output and data capture and interpretation) units of their kind now available. The addition of ten print fingerprint scanning technology will enable the Bureau to identify applicants with criminal or other US law enforcement records based on biometric data, regardless of the written personal information submitted on their applications.  This will ensure that the Department of State fully complies with Section 303 of The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.

The Intelligence Research and Information System (IRIS), an message handling and text retrieval and storage system, provides the ITA Division with an automated method to gather and analyze information for the preparation of the daily security alerts and briefings to the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security. The use of the Retrieval Ware system is based upon the fact the software is used for the IRIS system and identical to that procured by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) for their INR Information Support System (INRISS).  We must continue to utilize the same software to receive traffic from INR.  Thus, DS requests the sole source procurement of the RetrievalWare maintenance and support services.

All DSS Regional Security Officers (RSOs) and their Security Engineers have been trained to reload grenades, test and monitor the operation of theses units.The statutory permitting other that full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).  The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplier or service will satisfy the agencys requirements. It is critical to the Department of State and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security mission and for the continued safety of personnel worldwide that the system be procured through NonLethal Technologies the license manufacture of the MPG Grenade Line.  Militech International, LL, is the only distributor for NonLethal Technologies.  No other company is known that makes a similar Electronically Fire Tear Gas reloads that will interface with our existing stock MSI dispensers and function similar to equipment currently in service. For the continuity of the operation, training, reliability and safety experience by users in the worldwide field.  The system and accessories have been requested for the personnel who were trained on the use of these systems, and are supplied to all of the existing embassies worldwide.  The dispensers requested are needed to equip the Embassy with familiar, safe, and reliably functional protective equipment.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all personnel on any new make, model, or system design.

1.    CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION:  The contracting organization responsible for this action is the

2.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: The action required is for the purchase of a Mercom Recording System to record emergency radio and telephone traffic from the Emergency Communication Center for the Fire and Emergency Services Flight of the 4th Civil Engineering Squadron, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC 27531.

3.    DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES:  The purchase of a Mercom Recorder, to include installation  
       and training.

4.    AUTHORITY:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this 
       acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 6.302-1(c).

5.    APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY:  Mercom Recorders are designed to meet the needs of a wide 
       range of voice recording applications in dispatch centers that are equipped with the Positron Life Line
       100 Controller.  The Positron Life Line 100 is currently being used in the Emergency Communications 
       Center on Seymour Johnson AFB.  This is the only recorder capable of integrating with the Positron 
       system and will allow for automatic playback for Emergency Communications Center dispatchers.  
       This ensures that the information is correct and emergency crews are given proper information.

7.    FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:  This requirement was found on GSA; however, this does not 
       include installation and 1 day of training.  Market Research determined that the Government could obtain competitive 
pricing by posting the requirement on the Federal Business Opportunities website.  Per Steve Lomax, Carolina Recording System offers this requirement for the same amount and  includes installation and training at no cost to the Government.  The price has been determined fair and reasonable IAW FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(i).   

8.    MARKET SURVEY:  There are recorders available such as NICE and Voice Print but they  
        do not record information such as the phone number, address and caller's name.  The Mercom 
          Recorder is the only recorder available that records all of this information.
       
9.	OTHER FACTS:  N/A 

10.	INTERESTED SOURCES:  Carolina Recording System and Mercom Systems, Inc. 

11.  STEPS TO FOSTER COMPETITION:  See paragraphs 6 and 8.

       that the technical requirements and certifications are complete and accurate.

<DESC>GSAs Southeast Sunbelt Region announces a contracting opportunity for agency construction management (CMa) services in connection with the design and construction of a proposed twenty-five to thirty million dollar (hard construction cost) project in the Fairlie Poplar Historic District of downtown Atlanta, GA.  The proposed project is an annex to the existing Elbert P. Tuttle United States Court of Appeals Building (Tuttle Building Annex).  The 120,000 gsf project is the adaptive use of two existing historic, five story buildings with basements, new construction of a loading dock and tunnel connection to the existing Tuttle Building for administrative office space for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.  The project is being delivered using the design-build bridging methodology.  The "bridging" architect-engineer is Stevens & Wilkinson Stang & Newdow of Atlanta, GA.   A contract for abatement and demolition based on complete construction documents is scheduled for award to an 8(a) certified firm in Sept 2006. This CMa contract is scheduled for award about Oct 2006. The bridging design is scheduled for completion in mid-Jan 2007.  A separate design-build contract based on approx. 35% complete contract (bridging) documents is scheduled for award in May 2007.  The design documents for the project are being produced using Revit v9.0 and Constructware is the ePM collaboration tool.

Scope of Work
CMa services under this contract will generally include design management, construction management, and building commissioning services.  The CMa through a multi-disciplinary team shall assist GSA in performing design reviews using Dr. Checks of the final design intent documents by the Bridging A/E and the production of construction documents by the Design Build contractors A/E (Architect of Record).  The CMa shall assist GSA in managing and administering the contracts for construction with the abatement/demolition contractor and with the Design Build contractor for all other work.  The CMa shall perform Building Commissioning services to verify and document that the performance of the facility and its various systems meet the design intent as well as the functional and operational needs of the building owner and the occupants of the building.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases.

    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the August 2006 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 05-12.  This acquisition is NOT small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541511.  This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure Relais user license, maintenance and support on a sole source basis from Relais International Inc., Canada.  In 1996, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) purchased the Relais Enterprise system to automate the processing and handling of over 350,000 DOCLINE requests which reach NLM annually for distribution to the Collection Access Section and the History of Medicine Division.  Additionally, the system is used to automate the processing, sorting, and accounting for over 10,000 requests submitted by NLM?s patrons using the Locatorplus System to submit requests using the Overnight Photocopy Service.  NLM has a requirement for an automated system that can accept orders from multiple external sources in different formats.  The system must identify the requestor, sort documents according to their library location, redirect orders alternate holdings when items are unavailable, manage exception handling for problem orders, convert documents to the format the client requested (e.g. fax, digital, paper), transmit the document to the client, determine billing amounts, and it must know where the order is in the system at all times.  Benefits of the system must include reductions in labor requirements and reduced cycle times for fulfilling ILL.  NLM requires that the system be MS Windows compliant and network-based.  The system must use Oracle for its database.  The system must operate with scanners capable of reproducing journal articles at the rate of 21 pages per minute.  Only Relais International?s Relais system carries the unique capabilities which fit the above stated requirements of the NLM.  No other product on the market that has been developed for automating library services provides the capabilities of this system or is suitable for this environment.  The Relais System is a proprietary product of Relais International, Inc.  Since Relais International, Inc. is the sole owner of the Relais System, NLM has determined that Relais International, Inc., is the only source with the previous experience and expertise capable of providing the necessary technical support and system upgrades.  Additionally, during the year we need technical support from Relais International, Inc., to ensure proper functioning of the system.  As part of the license agreement, NLM will receive software upgrades for the Relais Enterprise free of charge.  The purchase order term will be September 30, 2006 through September 29, 2007 with option for four (4) successive one-year periods.  All proposals received within fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office by September 28, 2006 from the date of publication of this notice, and must meet the criteria requirement.  The quoter shall include all information which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation.  All responses from responsible sources will be considered.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Contract Specialist, on (301) 496-6127.

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)
Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.

1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005: 

a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, " Employment Eligibility Verification, " and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level: 

High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation

d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: 

1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
2) Favorable fingerprint results; 
3) Favorable credit report, if required; 
4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. 
A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 

If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 

e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.

2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: 

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:

a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b. Favorable fingerprint results; 
c. Favorable credit report, if required; and 
d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. 

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. 

3. Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. 

a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. 

b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. 

c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. 

d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 

4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. 

5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. 

52.233-2 SERVICE OF PROTEST (AUG 1996)
(a) Protests, as defined in Section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the General Accounting Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from:

Contractor personnel are advised that Vehicle operators on a DoD installation and operators of Government owned vehicles will not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a hands-free device.  The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hands-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited (DoD Joint Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision Regulation, paragraph 4-2).  Using a cell phone while driving, without a hands free device will be considered a "primary offense", meaning that violators will be able to be stopped and ticketed solely for this offense.  Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on you ability to perform your contract.

F.	MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION ON BASE:

Contractor personnel are advised that seat belt usage is mandatory at all times on Offutt AFB.  Nebraska state law requires the use of restraints in a vehicle.  Air Force Instruction 31.204, Air Force Motor Traffic Supervision, prescribes that installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws both on and off base.  Accordingly, while on Offutt AFB, operators and passengers must wear restraints and may be ticketed by Offutt security personnel for failure to comply.  Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on you ability to perform your contract.

Using a cell phone while driving, without a hands free device will be considered a "primary offense", meaning that violators will be able to be stopped and ticketed solely for this offense.  Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on you ability to perform your contract.

In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the CO, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof.

Only the CO is authorized to formally resolve such problems.  Therefore, the Contractor is hereby directed to bring all such contractual problems to the immediate attention of the CO.  Any request for contract changes/modification shall be submitted to the CO.

The contractor is responsible to maintain active CCR registration until final payment has been made.  CCR registration must be updated and renewed annually.  http://www.ccr.gov


D.	DELIVERY / BASE ACCESS REQUIREMENTS

Delivery personnel must use the SAC Gate off of Capehart road south of the Bellevue, Nebraska , Highway 370 exit.  Report to the Visitor's Center and call for escort (if needed) to the final destination: 

Delivery vehicles are subject to search by Security Forces personnel.

E.	SALES TAX

Offutt Air Force Base is exempt from paying state and local taxed per 4 U.S.C. 104-107.  The State of Nebraska State Revenue Statutes, Sec 77-2704.02 and regulation 1-12 and 1-72 implement 4 USC 104-107 and are applicable to this purchase.

F.	MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION ON BASE:

Contractor personnel are advised that seat belt usage is mandatory at all times on Offutt AFB.  Nebraska state law requires the use of restraints in a vehicle.  Air Force Instruction 31.204, Air Force Motor Traffic Supervision, prescribes that installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws both on and off base.  Accordingly, while on Offutt AFB, operators and passengers must wear restraints and may be ticketed by Offutt security personnel for failure to comply.  Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on you ability to perform your contract.

Contractor personnel are advised that Vehicle operators on a DoD installation and operators of Government owned vehicles will not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a hands-free device.  The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hands-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited (DoD Joint Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision Regulation, paragraph 4-2).  Using a cell phone while driving, without a hands free device will be considered a "primary offense", meaning that violators will be able to be stopped and ticketed solely for this offense.  Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on you ability to perform your contract.

The Contracting Officer (CO) is the only person authorized to approve changes or modify any of the requirements under this contract and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the CO.  In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the CO, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof.

Only the CO is authorized to formally resolve such problems.  Therefore, the Contractor is hereby directed to bring all such contractual problems to the immediate attention of the CO.  Any request for contract changes/modification shall be submitted to the CO.

The contractor is responsible to maintain active CCR registration until final payment has been made.  CCR registration must be updated and renewed annually.  http://www.ccr.gov


D.	DELIVERY / BASE ACCESS REQUIREMENTS

Delivery personnel must use the SAC Gate off of Capehart road south of the Bellevue, Nebraska , Highway 370 exit.  Report to the Visitor's Center and call for escort (if needed) to the final destination: 

Delivery vehicles are subject to search by Security Forces personnel.

All personnel accessing Offutt Air Force Base will be held to safety/security rules of engagement when entering and while on base.

E.	SALES TAX

Offutt Air Force Base is exempt from paying state and local taxed per 4 U.S.C. 104-107.  The State of Nebraska State Revenue Statutes, Sec 77-2704.02 and regulation 1-12 and 1-72 implement 4 USC 104-107 and are applicable to this purchase.

F.	MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION ON BASE:

Contractor personnel are advised that seat belt usage is mandatory at all times on Offutt AFB.  Nebraska state law requires the use of restraints in a vehicle.  Air Force Instruction 31.204, Air Force Motor Traffic Supervision, prescribes that installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws both on and off base.  Accordingly, while on Offutt AFB, operators and passengers must wear restraints and may be ticketed by Offutt security personnel for failure to comply.  Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on you ability to perform your contract.

Contractor personnel are advised that Vehicle operators on a DoD installation and operators of Government owned vehicles will not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a hands-free device.  The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hands-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited (DoD Joint Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision Regulation, paragraph 4-2).  Using a cell phone while driving, without a hands free device will be considered a "primary offense", meaning that violators will be able to be stopped and ticketed solely for this offense.  Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on you ability to perform your contract.

B.	CHANGES TO THIS CONTRACT / PURCHASE ORDER / DELIVERY ORDER

The Contracting Officer (CO) is the only person authorized to approve changes or modify any of the requirements under this contract and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the CO.  In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the CO, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof.

Contractual problems, of any nature, which might occur during the life of the contract must be handled in conformance with public laws and regulations and must be referred to the CO for resolution.  Only the CO is authorized to formally resolve such problems.  Therefore, the Contractor is hereby directed to bring all such contractual problems to the immediate attention of the CO.  Any request for contract changes/modification shall be submitted to the CO.


C.	CCR REGISTRATION 

Invoice payment cannot be made if a contractor's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is inactive.  Invoices received from a contractor who fails to maintain active CCR registration are  considered to be improper and may be returned.  The contractor is responsible to maintain active CCR registration until final payment has been made.  CCR registration must be updated and renewed annually.  http://www.ccr.gov


D.	DELIVERY / BASE ACCESS REQUIREMENTS

Delivery personnel must use the SAC Gate off of Capehart road south of the Bellevue, Nebraska , Highway 370 exit.  Report to the Visitor's Center and call for escort (if needed) to the final destination: 

Delivery vehicles are subject to search by Security Forces personnel.  All tools, including assembly tools, must be secured within a toolbox in the trailer of the vehicle and should not be transported on base in the cab of the vehicle.  All personnel accessing Offutt Air Force Base will be held to safety/security rules of engagement when entering and while on base.  These rules include a ban on weapons to include firearms, loaded or otherwise, and the transport of any explosive material.  


E.	SALES TAX

Offutt Air Force Base is exempt from paying state and local taxed per 4 U.S.C. 104-107.  The State of Nebraska State Revenue Statutes, Sec 77-2704.02 and regulation 1-12 and 1-72 implement 4 USC 104-107 and are applicable to this purchase.

Per FAR 52.229-3 and/or 52.229-4, applicable NE State tax costs should be included in the bid/proposal submitted by the offeror/contractor.   


F.	MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION ON BASE:

Contractor personnel are advised that seat belt usage is mandatory at all times on Offutt AFB.  Nebraska state law requires the use of restraints in a vehicle.  Air Force Instruction 31.204, Air Force Motor Traffic Supervision, prescribes that installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws both on and off base.  Accordingly, while on Offutt AFB, operators and passengers must wear restraints and may be ticketed by Offutt security personnel for failure to comply.  Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on you ability to perform your contract.

Contractor personnel are advised that Vehicle operators on a DoD installation and operators of Government owned vehicles will not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a hands-free device.  The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hands-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited (DoD Joint Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision Regulation, paragraph 4-2).  Using a cell phone while driving, without a hands free device will be considered a "primary offense", meaning that violators will be able to be stopped and ticketed solely for this offense.  Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on you ability to perform your contract.

B.	CHANGES TO THIS CONTRACT / PURCHASE ORDER / DELIVERY ORDER

The Contracting Officer (CO) is the only person authorized to approve changes or modify any of the requirements under this contract and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with the CO.  In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the CO, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof.

Contractual problems, of any nature, which might occur during the life of the contract must be handled in conformance with public laws and regulations and must be referred to the CO for resolution.  Only the CO is authorized to formally resolve such problems.  Therefore, the Contractor is hereby directed to bring all such contractual problems to the immediate attention of the CO.  Any request for contract changes/modification shall be submitted to the CO.


C.	CCR REGISTRATION 

Invoice payment cannot be made if a contractor's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is inactive.  Invoices received from a contractor who fails to maintain active CCR registration are  considered to be improper and may be returned.  The contractor is responsible to maintain active CCR registration until final payment has been made.  CCR registration must be updated and renewed annually.  http://www.ccr.gov


D.	DELIVERY / BASE ACCESS REQUIREMENTS

Delivery personnel must use the SAC Gate off of Capehart road south of the Bellevue, Nebraska , Highway 370 exit.  Report to the Visitor's Center and call for escort (if needed) to the final destination: 

Delivery vehicles are subject to search by Security Forces personnel.  All tools, including assembly tools, must be secured within a toolbox in the trailer of the vehicle and should not be transported on base in the cab of the vehicle.  All personnel accessing Offutt Air Force Base will be held to safety/security rules of engagement when entering and while on base.  These rules include a ban on weapons to include firearms, loaded or otherwise, and the transport of any explosive material.  


E.	SALES TAX

Offutt Air Force Base is exempt from paying state and local taxed per 4 U.S.C. 104-107.  The State of Nebraska State Revenue Statutes, Sec 77-2704.02 and regulation 1-12 and 1-72 implement 4 USC 104-107 and are applicable to this purchase. 

55 CONS can no longer provide signed NE Form 17?s for contractors.  
Per FAR 52.229-3 and/or 52.229-4, applicable NE State tax costs should be included in the bid/proposal submitted by the offeror/contractor.   


F.	MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION ON BASE:

Contractor personnel are advised that seat belt usage is mandatory at all times on Offutt AFB.  Nebraska state law requires the use of restraints in a vehicle.  Air Force Instruction 31.204, Air Force Motor Traffic Supervision, prescribes that installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws both on and off base.  Accordingly, while on Offutt AFB, operators and passengers must wear restraints and may be ticketed by Offutt security personnel for failure to comply.  Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on you ability to perform your contract.

Contractor personnel are advised that Vehicle operators on a DoD installation and operators of Government owned vehicles will not use cell phones unless the vehicle is safely parked or unless they are using a hands-free device.  The wearing of any other portable headphones, earphones, or other listening devices (except for hands-free cellular phones) while operating a motor vehicle is prohibited (DoD Joint Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision Regulation, paragraph 4-2).  Using a cell phone while driving, without a hands free device will be considered a "primary offense", meaning that violators will be able to be stopped and ticketed solely for this offense.  Repeated offenses on Offutt AFB will result in the loss of on-base driving privileges and could have an adverse affect on you ability to perform your contract.


G.	REQUIRED INSURANCE (IAW FAR 28-306(b))

Reference FAR clause entitled "Insurance ... ? the Contractor shall, at its own expense, procure and thereafter maintain the following kinds of insurance with respect to performance under the contract.

1.	Workmen's Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance as required by law except that if this contract is to be performed in a State which does not require or permit private insurance, then compliance with the statutory or administrative requirements in any such State will be satisfactory.  The required Workmen's Compensation insurance shall extend to cover employer's liability for accidental bodily injury or death and for occupational disease with a minimum liability limit of $100,000.

2.	General Liability Insurance.	Bodily injury liability insurance, in the minimum limits of $500,000 per occurrence shall be required on the comprehensive form of policy.

3.	Automobile Liability Insurance.	This insurance shall be required on the comprehensive form of policy and shall  provide bodily injury liability and property damage liability covering the operation of all automobiles used in connection with the performance of the contract.  At least the minimum limits of $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury and $20,000 per occurrence for property damage shall be required.


H.	ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

In addition to the FAR and DFARS clauses included in this contract,
1.	Contractor warrants that it is familiar with all local, county, state and Federal environmental regulations.

2.	Contractor agrees to perform all required training and notifications concerning hazardous waste or materials related to contractor's activities and maintain an on-site listing of employees so trained.

3.	Contractor agrees to properly manage all hazardous waste and materials related to contractor's activities.

4.	Contractor agrees that it shall reimburse the Government for any penalties assessed against the Government by any Environmental Regulatory Agency for environmental violations related to Contractor activities.

5.	Contractor agrees to include this provision in each subcontract.


I.	ANTI-TERRORISM INFORMATION AND CONSIDERATIONS

1.	Base Entry:	All contractor vehicles will enter through the SAC Gate and have a proper vehicle search conducted.  Exceptions to this policy will be coordinated through the contracting officer and appropriate security forces personnel.

2.	Areas Off Limits:	The following areas are off limits unless given specific permission, an escort, or work is to be performed in the area listed.  Restricted areas, flight line area, General?s row, dormitories (Bldgs 324, 326, 365, 367, 400 and 402), Bldg 500 complex, and gymnasiums (Offutt Field House and Frady Fitness Center).  Travel to and from the worksite will be made by the most direct route possible.  

3.	Force Protection Conditions (FPCONS):	FPCONS describe the progressive level of countermeasures in response to a terrorist threat to US military facilities and personnel.  Force Protection Condition measures are used to deter terrorist attacks on DoD facilities and personnel by:
A. Varying routines.
B. Being sensitive to changes in the security atmosphere around DoD facilities and personnel.

The five FPCONS are defined as the following:
1. Normal:	This condition applies when a general global threat of possible terrorist activity exists and warrants a routine security posture
2. Alpha:	This condition applies when a general threat of possible terrorist activity against personnel and facilities, the nature and extent of which are unpredictable.
3. Bravo:	This condition applies when an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist activity exists.
4. Charlie:	This condition applies when an incident occurs or intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely.
5. Delta:	This condition applies in the immediate area where a terrorist attack has occurred or when intelligence has been received that terrorist action against a specific location or person is imminent. 

Contractors may be asked to leave the base or not be allowed to enter the base when in elevated FPCONs.  For further information concerning FPCONs, contact the contracting administrator or contracting officer for additional guidance.

4.	Contractors identified as mission essential, have been briefed on additional duties and responsibilities associated with increased FPCONs.

5.	Suspicious Activities/Stolen Equipment:	Please report any suspicious activity or stolen equipment to the Law Enforcement Desk at 294-6110.

6.	Searches/Spot Checks:	During increased Random Force Protection Measures (RAMs) contractors and their equipment are subject to search via RAMs at any time.  Spot checks may also be conducted due to RAMs.

7.	Identification:  	Contractor personnel must keep base issued identification on their person while working on base.

Current access  information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), com mercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  Thes e gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on  which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delay s in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt conc rete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles  (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access  to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort L ewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Le wis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, a ll contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Le wis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwi se notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obt ain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twic e per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will  be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The co ntractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is re sponsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor em ployee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by  obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c .  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor  shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the C ontracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely perform ance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting th e contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, t he contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contr acting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn  on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contr actor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until al l identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so,  for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.  Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the C ontractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 and DL 360 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5  and DL 360 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Departments networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/IIs Production Support Upgrades project needs.  The HP DL380 G5  and DL 360 G5 server and components meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options:  Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management  Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health  Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks  Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives  Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers  Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities)  CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting  1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives  Systems must have front video/USB ports  Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources  Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5  and DL 360 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureaus System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers servers indicated that these most closely met the DoSs processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers server configurations or to manage multiple vendors yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5  and DL 360 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5  and DL 360 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec) B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C) Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales. D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY.

The following FAR clauses in paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, will apply: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34. The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions. FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The selected Offeror must submit a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. FOB DESTINATION CONUS In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation. Bids must be valid for 30 days after close of competition. No Exceptions or Qualifications. It is required that the Sig Sauer P229 Pistol be purchased to issue to the agents who will be assigned to overseas Posts.  This will enable the agents to provide continued protection and security for personnel. Additionally, continued safe travel and protected movement is required for high level U.S. Embassy and Consulate officials while traveling overseas, and for Ambassador level officials serving in international organizations working to restore and maintain economic and social stability.  Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol is the issued pistol that all agents are trained on.  Overall length: 7.1 inches, Overall height: 5.4 inches, Overall width: 1.5 inches, Barrel length: 3.9 inches, Weight w/o mag: 28.1 oz, Mag weight: 3.0 oz, Sight radius: 5.7 inches.  State Department requires the Law Enforcement magazine which holds 13 rounds as opposed to 10 rounds.  DS also requires the Trijicon night sights.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(2).  The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will meet the agencys need.Under the Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has a broad range of responsibilities that include the protection of personnel and facilities, both domestic and abroad.  Without the weapons requested, the Diplomatic Security Service will be unable to provide the proper level of security and protection.  The Sig Sauer P229 9mm pistol is a unique system that our armorers have been certified to repair and the agents have been trained to use.  Utilizing a weapon manufactured by another manufacturer can create a legal liability issue.  The U.S. Department of State cannot utilize multiple systems for our weapons for the above reasons.The weapons requested are what the agents were trained to use during their initial training as Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent Training.  The economic impact to the U.S. Government for using other items than what is requested, would be great and would involve the re-training of all agents in the field including purchasing all new weapons systems to issue to the various mission locations be it overseas or abroad.  Sig Sauer is the manufacturer of the P229 Pistol.The DS Firearms Policy and Review Board (FPRB) has approved the use of the Sig Sauer as the ONLY pistol authorized for use by DS Agents.  Therefore, no market research was done. The weapons system described above are to be utilized by the agents assigned to overseas posts.  The vendor states that the lead time on these items is 90-120 days from the date of order and no other source could provide them in such a timely manner, these items are needed as soon as possible, so it is imperative that this be treated as circumstances permitting other than full and open competition.  DS has verified that the request as described represents the governments minimum requirements. ***NOTE:  It is required that the TRIJICON NIGHT SIGHTS be assembled prior to delivery. ****

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Chief Technology Office.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Department of State approved Desktop IT equipment. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements of compatibility with existing operational equipment across the DS Enterprise. Because of the interchangeable parts supporting the equipment, it provides a cost effective process in managing an Enterprise asset that is used by DS in all of its CONUS locations. By standardizing on one baseline configuration, the management and support render to the end user is streamlined. DS/CTO/SMD/OPS has identified Dell Desktop equipment as a key component for DS desktop support. Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of States enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configurations that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components. These are essential management tools in support of non-CTO manned Resident and Field office support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement. CHANGED PART #'S FOR LINE ITEMS: 014 & 015

STATEMENT OF WORK

ATTESTATION ENGAGEMENT and PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR USDOL'S INTERNATIONAL CHILD LABOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

I.	INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to obtain Advisory and Assistance Services to meet on-going needs of the ILAB International Child Labor Program (ICLP) on attestation engagement and Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) issues.  

Applicants should submit proposals addressing the objective(s) identified in the Introduction (Section I), the scope of work (Section II), and identified delivery requirements (Section IV).  

A.	Background

USDOL's International Child Labor Program (ICLP), within the Bureau of International Labor Affairs conducts research on international child labor, administers grant and contracts to organizations engaged in efforts to eliminate exploitive child labor, and raises awareness about this important international child labor issue.  

The ICLP's grant administration responsibilities have grown quickly since 1995. ICLP has administered some 180 child labor projects in over 70 countries around the world through: 1) the International Labor Organization's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (ILO/IPEC); and 2) various organizations that implement Child Labor Education Initiative projects to expand access to basic quality education in areas with a high incidence of child labor.	

The demands for increased accountability in both the financial and performance arenas have grown significantly with the expansion in the numbers of ICLP projects in operation throughout the developing world.  To address these demands, ICLP initiated a project level attestation engagement program in FY 2005 to examine the timeliness and accuracy of grantee GPRA data, financial reporting and compliance USDOL and USG regulations.  The program has contracted under a Blanket Purchase Agreement with an accounting firm to perform attestation engagements of its cooperative agreements in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards published by the Government Accountability Office.  The ICLP has also negotiated with the External Auditor for the International Labor Organization (ILO) to conduct attestation engagements of the projects that ICLP funds through the ILO.  This advisory services contract will provide expert advice and training to ICLP employees to ensure that:  1) the work conducted under the BPA and by the ILO External Auditor meets ICLP's needs and that the quality is acceptable under the relevant professional standards; 2) project level compliance and GPRA performance data reviews conducted by ICLP staff are performed in an efficient and effective manner.

The numbers and complexity of ICLP projects, as well as the evolution of GPRA requirements under the budget and performance integration initiative of the President's Management Agenda and OMB's Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) also require that ICLP obtain the services of a contractor with expertise in the performance management arena.  In particular, the program is measuring and reporting on its cost efficiency.  The contractor will assist ICLP in refining its measurement approaches, assist ILAB in setting and achieving new efficiency targets, and offer guidance on using the efficiency measures to improve ICLP decision making.  In addition, the consultant will be needed to advise ICLP on assessing Education Initiative (EI) performance data and provide assistance to the program in revising the measures or data collection procedures, if warranted, to ensure that the performance data accurately and validly measure the outcomes of the EI projects.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to post replies to questions received and to extend the response date.

Q: Can you confirm that the metro Washington, DC area was removed from the SOW?
A: The Washington, DC area is not being competed.

Q: Will the core interpreter be asked to work longer than an 8 hour day?
A: No, the core interpreters' working hours are at the discretion of the vendor.

Q: How many core interpreters is the government requesting each day?
A: The number is unknown and would be the discretion of the vendor.
 
Q: Will a core interpreter/s be needed in each of the 7 offices listed in the Scope of Work?
A: No

Q: Are we able to set different rates in each of the areas? 
A: Yes, the government does not direct pricing

Q: Because of regional differences in cancellation policies, is there any flexibility to the stated policy? 
A: To lesson the administrative burden for the government and vendor one standard policy across the board was selected.  DOT employees and managers are educated on the importance of both providing adequate notice to vendors to order and when needed, cancel services.  Excessive late requests and cancellations will not be tolerated by the COTR and frequent abusers will be addressed.
Section VI. Reporting Requirements:    The paragraph indicated a sample form is attached.  

Q. There was no form attached in the SOW, please send a sample form.
A: The form should have been attached at it is the last page of the SOW.  Please resend if necessary.

Section VII.  Invoice Requirements:  The contractor shall submit with each invoice the attached verification of services form attached for payment.   

Q: Clarification needed.  Is the interpreter expected to have the attached sample ?Interpreting Service Receipt/Job Verification? with them to have signed at the completion of each assignment?   Is that needed for when the core interpreter is working an 8 hour day?  
A: The Job verification sheet proves that the services were actually rendered.  It must accompany the vendor's invoice to DOT.  It is purely the vendor's discretion as to when this is signed by DOT personnel.

Q: number of interpreters needed for the SOW
A: That would be determined by the vendor based on the daily and weekly request trends

Q: number of workers who are deaf in the SOW
A: Approximately 22 known Deaf and hard of hearing in the Regions and 40 in metro Washington, DC.

Q: The SOW states that one interpreter may be sufficient for most assignments of two hour or less. Is there a way that this can be modified to 1.5 hours or less.
A: most cases means that there will be inherent exceptions. Two-hours is the minimum requirement for services
A: Each assignment will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  The One interpreter model is based on simple meetings where the meeting may only be an hour long (even though the vendor's minimum will be 2 hours) and the Deaf employee is not a presenter but merely an attendee. The COTR and Vendor will recommend two interpreters when the requirement for two interpreters becomes known.

Q: If the working/core hours for interpreters are 7-5pm,and an interpreter works 10 hours days, are we able to charge/bill for the overtime hours for that day? 
A: We have not in the past needed to provision for overtime.  Most services are structured so there is no unexpected or expected overtime.

Q: Will the government provide TTY or equivalent communication system or should we include the cost of such equipment in our proposal?  We would be contracting for this requirement at our corporate office in Oklahoma City, Ok. However, the personnel to support the various locations would be provided by our local offices in the various locations. Should the local offices have the TTY system or would having the equipment in our corporate office suffice? Following this procedure we see no or little travel requirements.
A: The government will provide communication devices to its own Deaf

Q; With regard to interpreting services offered for the most recent fiscal year, how many hours of oncall interpreting services were provided for the metro Washington, DC area employees?
A: Zero (0) we only cover scheduled events and do not provide "on-call" services. 

Q: What is the level of US Government Security Clearance that is needed or anticipated to be needed for assignments at DOT (eg, TS/SCI, etc)?  
A: Standard and Sensitive 
 
Q: After reading through the statement of work, I noticed a potential issue with one of the requirements and would like to ask for clarification.  All of the modes of communication that are mentioned (PSE, ASL, SEE) are based solely on the grammar and struction of American Sign Language or American Sign Language and English with one exception.  Cued Speech is not a true language and is not based in any way on ASL, but rather a completely different system of handshapes.  I feel certain that the amount of interpreters certified through RID and NAD who are also qualified to interpret Cued Speech are extremely few.  I am an ASL interpreter who holds dual national certification and have been working in the DC market for many years and have never met and ASL interpreter who can do both.  Further, it is highly unusual to find an Deaf or hard of hearing individual who uses both systems. Based on this, can you tell me the following. 

Q: Is DOT looking for one person, company or entity to provide both services?   
A: DOT is looking for one or more companies that can provide the level of service as outlined in the SOW. 

Q: How many hours of Cued Speech interpreting was procured in the previous fiscal year in the metro Washington, DC area?  
A: Washington, DC is not a region being competed 

Q: Will DOT sponsor the clearance process for suitable interpreters in order for them to obtain security clearance if they commit to regular ongoing work for DOT?  
A: DOT will meet and cover any badging requirements that supports DOT security requirements outside of fees for personal contractor requirements such as government driver's licenses, interpreting certification fees, etc. 

Q: Does DOT currently use any online request submittion process for interpreting services?
A: Yes 

Q: Please define LATE requests as cited in 3G of the SOW.   
A: a request made with less than twenty-four (24) hours notice to vendor.

Q: Please define LATE cancellations as cited in 3G of the SOW.   
A: a cancellation of requested services that is requested of the vendor with less than forty-eight (48) hours notice - Counting business days only. 

Q: What is the justification for the 24 hour cancellation fee policy in the DC metro area as apposed to the 48 hour cancellation fee policy int he other seven region as this is atypical for the Washington, DC interpreting market and not consistent with any of the major vendors or independent contract/direct hire service providers in that area?  
A: It meets DOT business needs in said regions.  For example regions that may have multiple vendors when one vendor versus another is contacted for services it's usually because the first vendor is unable to fulfill the need so there may only be proper notice  allocated for the first vendor and not the second or third.

Q: How much in dollars, did DOT pay in cancellation fees in the previous fiscal year?
A: Information is currently not available for all FY05 regions. 

Q: Will monthly reports, invoices and other official communications between the awardee and DOT be accepted through email rather than regular post? 
A: Yes, if the mode of delivery meets the reporting requirements at the end of the day. 

Q: Are oncall interpreters used regularly and if so, how are oncall hours reimbursed as compared to actual number of hours of interpreting as stated in section 7B of the SOW?
A: N/A 

Q: How does DOT reconcile the confidentiality agreement requirement with the reporting and maintenance of statistical information by deaf/hard of hearing consumers based on their identity and other request details?    
A: Our records are kept confidential and on a need to know basis.

<DESC>ELBERT P. TUTTLE BUILDING ANNEX
PRE-SUBMITTAL MEETING, July 19, 2006
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q:  Can resumes be single spaced?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Usually when GSA outlines evaluation factors with percentages they do not request in addition the SF 330  Part I and Part II.  What we need to know is do they want the evaluation responses as a separate component or do they want that information folded into the SF 330  Part I:

   Evaluation Factor 1, Experience & Past Performance of the Team, SF 330, Section F 
   Evaluation Factor 2, Team Organization & Management Plan, SF 330, Section H
   Evaluation Factor 3, Key Personnel, SF 330, Section E 

A:  The SF 330 is a required submission.  It is left to the discretion of the firm submitting as to whether the information for the evaluation factors will be provided separately or folded into the SF 330.   

Q:  Clarify that the Small Business Subcontracting Plan and/or narrative description of outreach efforts to small businesses will not be due until the next step which is the Request for Proposal (RFP).

A:  If the firm submitting is a large business then a small business subcontracting plan is required at time of submission.  We realize this plan cannot be a firm plan at that time, but it allows the evaluators to determine how much and, in general, to whom consultant work will subcontracted to.  A final small business plan will be required prior to contract award. 

Q:  What are the systems to be commissioned?
-	HVAC, DHW, lighting?
-	Lighting plus electrical (UPS, generators)?
-	Envelope?
-	Fire/Life Safety?

A:  This is yet to be defined.

Q:  Please define the requirements for being considered a small business.

A:  This project has a NAICS Code of 541310, Architectural Services, for which the small business size standard is $4.5M gross average sales receipts for the past three years.  We apologize for the solicitation synopsis having an incorrect small business size standard.

Q:  Does having experience with Ready Check qualify as an alternative to Dr. Checks?

A:  Having a specific software product will not make one contractor more qualified than another.

Q:  Will the project be LEED Certified?  What Level?

A:  Yes.  At the Silver Level.

Q:  Will the CM be required to have experience using Revit?

A:  The CM must be familiar with these tools.  If the competency is not in-house, then it should be obtained through a consultant.   

Q:  Does the SF 330 requirements for the submission include Section E (Resumes) and Section F (Projects)?

A:  Yes.

Q:  Is an SF 330 required just from the Prime, or from the consultants as well?  In other words, is this a combined SF 330?

A:  Prepare a separate Part II for each firm that will be part of the team proposed and submitted with Part I.

Q:  Is there a page limitation for the qualifications submission?

A:  As stated in the RFQ posted on FedBizOpps, the page limitations are:  Experience & Past Performance of Team, maximum of five pages per project; Team Organization & Management Plan, not to exceed five pages; Key Personnel, maximum of three pages for each.

Q:  Small Business Size Standard?  NAICS Code is 54130, Architectural Services, but RFP says small business is $28.5M.

A:  RFQ should have read $4.5M as the size standard.

Q:  Are you planning to include the relocation services?

A:  There is a statement in the RFQ that there may be post construction services consisting of move planning related services for the occupants of the building, but the decision has not yet been made if that will be included in this contract.  



Q:  Key Personnel 40% -- will subcontracting consultants receive the portion of the proposal to be responded to along with the names of the competing prime consultants?  This would allow us to forward necessary information to the primes that would be helpful towards getting the contract.

A:  If a firm wants to be a consultant, they need to co

DEFENSE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AGENCY (DISA)
DEFENSE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONTRACTING ORGANIZATION - EUROPE

LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION
TO PROCURE CISCO EQUIPMENT USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION



Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C.501), FAR Subpart 8.405-6.

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity

The requiring activity for this action is USAFE CSS/SCML, Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany. The contracting activity is DISA/DITCO Europe, Building 143, 67681 Sembach-Heuberg, Germany.

2.  Nature/Description of Action

Requirement is for the purchase of Cisco Synchronous Network Equipment (SONET) is for the upgrade of the USAFE, Technical Control Facilities (TCF) under the HQ USAFE TCF Modernization Program.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services

The requirement is for 51 CISCO Timing Communications Control Two Plus I-Temp, Part number: 15454-TCC2P-K9.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority

(40 U.S.C. 501), Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, FAR Subpart 8.405-6.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.
This is a part of on-going 51 million dollar MAJCOM-wide Modernization Program and the continued integration and implementation of a Technical Control Facility (TCF) Modernization Program.  The first installation was started in FY04 at Aviano, Italy and will continue through 2008. This product is also a standard device for the base infrastructure backbone currently being installed by the Combat Information Transport System (CITS) Project Air Force wide.  Currently there are 31 of these devices installed at five bases. This product is an upgrade to the existing controller cards already installed across the theater. As such, award of another brand would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  These costs include re-engineering, re-certification, and retraining of Government personnel on newly acquired non-standard equipment.  Therefore, the purchase of other brand equipment would add unforeseen costs to the overall TCF Upgrade Program.  The CISCO SONET product line has a proprietary integrated management capability that ensures consistency in the design, continuity of training, ease of use, and interoperability.  Furthermore USAFE/A6 is deploying an enterprise remote monitoring and management solution command-wide, which further justifies the CISCO solution as it allows the USAFE Network Operations and Security Center to use a single tool to manage all USAFE SONET equipment.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources

IAW FAR Part 5.202(a)(11), no announcement will be made to FEDBIZOPPS due to the fact that the award will be made to a pre-awarded GSA Schedule.  Numerous sources exist that provide CISCO equipment and significant sources will be solicited for quotes via GSA schedule. At least three GSA/federal schedule holders will be solicited for quotes.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price

The requirement will be competed with resellers of the equipment to ensure prices are fair and reasonable.

8.  Description of Market Research 

While brand name CISCO equipment may be restrictive, market research indicates there are several resellers of CISCO equipment.  

The research that produced the overarching solution for the USAFE TCF Modernization Program included the evaluation of several technologies and equipment manufacturers.  This included CISCO, Acorn, NET, Marconi, Carrier Access, Nortel Networks, and Timplex to name a few.  The evaluation consisted of personal experiences of USAFE personnel, review of product documentation obtained from the web, vendor provided demonstrations and product documentation, review of currently fielded equipment, and GSA schedule and retail pricing lists.  Based on the evaluations; an equipment suite was chosen based on capabilities, integration, and price.  This solution included the selection of the CISCO SONET product line as the optical layer multiplexer.

9.  Supporting Facts

This brand name of equipment is requested to maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the USAFE Theater.

10.  Listing of Interested sources: 

Any reseller or wholesaler of these products with competitive prices will express interest.

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition: 

USAFE must remain with the CISCO product line to ensure continuity, compatibility and consistency of existing equipment; and market research indicates that there are enough resellers of this product line to promote competition.

12.  Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule

The Government anticipates a 30-day delivery period after contractor?s receipt of order.

13.  Reference to Approved Acquisition Plan (AP)

Not applicable.

14.  Section 508 Compliance

Required Section 508 documentation has been provided.

15. This equipment has been JITC (Joint Interoperability Test Command) certified.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is as follows:

IAW FAR Part 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer, a Brand Name Justification has been approved for this acquisition for the purchase of Snap-on Tools only.  The Brand Name Justification reads, "The 23AMXS/75th Support Section has bought Snap-on tools since the squadron stood up and has been extremely satisfied with the quality and service this company has provided.  Snap-on has their own manufacturing plants which allows them to strictly control the design and manufacturing process of all their core products (wrenches, ratchets, sockets, screwdrivers and related products) resulting in the highest quality product available.  On site Snap-on representation provides consultation/advice concerning special application requirements, advice/training in hand tool safety and on-site warranty service.  They have the ability to design and provide custom tool kits upon request. This includes laser etching and custom foam drawer layouts to customer specifications.  This allows for complete tool inventory control and helps prevent FOD (foreign object damage).  Specialized foam is highly resistant to solvents and oils used for these drawers.  Oils and solvents are not absorbed, thus the foam will not deteriorate, shrink or swell.  Over the past 16 years, the A-10 Aircraft Crew Chiefs at Pope AFB have had several problems with broken tools from other tool manufacturers.  For example, wrenches rounded off and sockets split down the sides.  Pope AFB has had no problems at all with Snap-on tools.  Experience shows that other tool manufacturers used by Pope AFB have not met the quality standard that Snap-on Tools provides."

<DESC>This solicitation is hereby amended as follows:  The due date for this solicitation is changed from August 31, 2006 to 12:00 PM local time September 15, 2006. 

This amendment changes specification for the required Air Bearing Spindle

(The 0.1 microradian spec has been changed to 0.3 micro-radians).



Specifications: The air bearing spindle is intended to be used for high precision measurements of roundness and cylindricity of small components. Therefore, while the load bearing capacity is not critical, radial, axial and tilt errors are very important. The instrument shall have a radial and axial error motion of under 1 microinch and a tilt error of under 0.3 microradians. In order to determine the angular position, the optical angular encoder shall be integrated into the system. 

The encoder shall be capable of reading 18000 positions (resolution of 0.02) with a 10X interpolator. The dither at any position shall not be greater than 3 encoder counts. All support electronics and accessories shall be included. The servo-amplifier shall be capable of operating the air-bearing in start-stop mode.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
