<DESC>The RRB is an independent agency in the Executive branch of the Federal government. The RRB's primary function is to administer comprehensive retirement/survivor and unemployment/sickness insurance benefit programs for railroad workers and their families under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). The RRB also administers aspects of the Medicare program and has administrative responsibilities under the Social Security Act and Internal Revenue Code. The RRB headquarters is located at 844 N. Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611. The RRB currently employs approximately 900 employees who work in its headquarters and in 53 field offices across the continental United States in localities easily accessible by large numbers of railroad workers.
<p>The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) intends to acquire, via full and open competition, services to re-platform the RRB's legacy mainframe applications (approx. 10 million lines of code), currently written in COBOL/CICS, and associated databases and files to process on a cloud-ready and/or FedRAMP cloud server-based ecosystem.</p>
<p>The RRB anticipates that the services will begin in June 2018 for the base period services (discovery and re-platforming) plus option year(s). The RRB desires the discovery and re-platforming services to be completed in approximately 12-15 months from the date of award.<br /><br />It is the intent of the Government to process this procurement under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, and to ultimately award a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) Contract for the base services plus optional services as a result of the forthcoming solicitation.<br /><br />Offerors will be required to submit technical and price proposals, as well as a small business subcontracting plan. The Government anticipates that the resultant contract will be awarded on a best value basis where the technical volume will be considered more important than the price proposal.</p>
<p>Upon its release, the solicitation will be issued electronically and be available for downloading on the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov, on or about March 30, 2018 (Note: Due to issues caused by the&nbsp;Continuing Resolution expiring 3/23/18, there MAY be a delay in posting). The closing date for the receipt of offers will be set forth in the RFP. Paper copies, faxed copies, or email copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above website for posting of the RFP and any amendments thereto. The Government will not pay for the information received in response to the RFP, nor will the Government reimburse for any questions submitted.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the RRB. By submitting an offer, the offeror is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency. Failure to do so may represent grounds RRB to refuse to accept the offer. By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirements that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to submission of their offer. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.</p>
<p>The RRB will not respond to any inquiries regarding this announcement.</p>

<SUBJECT>Modernization of National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment - Ames, Iowa
<SOLNBR>123K2518R0006
<RESPDATE>033018
<CONTACT>Angela B. Wingert, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-504-1181, Fax 301-504-1216, Email angela.wingert@ars.usda.gov
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Modernization of the National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment (NLAE), located in Ames, Iowa. This NLAE Modernization Project will be implemented by the Design-Build project delivery method and will involve the modernization and renovation of a current research campus. The USDA has developed a set of Bridging Documents (plans and specifications) showing and describing the project's essential elements.
<p>BACKGROUND: The research mission of the NLAE is to generate information which addresses critical problems in agriculture and watershed management leading to the development of innovative solutions which increase the efficiency of agriculture systems and reduces environmental risk. NLAE was formed originally as the National Soil Tilth Laboratory in 1989. The research facilities at NLAE have far exceeded their service life. The original laboratory spaces have outlived their original functional provisions and the research programs housed therein would benefit from reconfiguration of most of the labs to suit current uses. Numerous HVAC, plumbing, energy efficiency, and building code deficiencies exist and must also be addressed.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: Design Build Contractor (DBC) services are expected for Architectural, Structural, Civil, Mechanical, Plumbing, Fire Protection, and Electrical Systems. The project scope includes a selective renovation of the 91,000 SF building; including the upgrade of the existing laboratories, replacement of fume hoods, laboratory casework replacement, HVAC upgrades including replacement of pneumatic with DDC controls, entry security upgrades, ADA improvements, plumbing system replacements, and fire alarm system upgrades. The building footprint will not change. The work will be completed while the laboratory remains open. The Bridging Documents will consist of a complete 50% design submission. The Design Build Contractor will use these documents as the basis to complete a set of construction documents.</p>
<p>BASE: <br />Base Item - All project design and construction work is contained in the Base Item, except for the Optional Items described below.</p>
<p>OPTIONS:<br />OPTION 001 - Replace the laboratory casework in Lab Rooms 131, 141, and 225.</p>
<p>OPTION 002 - Replace the Computer Room Cooling Unit.</p>
<p>OPTION 003 - Replace the Central Laboratory Air Compressors.</p>
<p>OPTION 004 - Replace the Central Laboratory Vacuum Compressors.</p>
<p>OPTION 005 - Replace existing Growth Chambers and upgrade controls on Conviron Growth Chambers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;GENERAL:<br />The contract performance time is approximately 520 calendar days (Base and all Optional Items) after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed. Total Design-Build cost is estimated to be more than $10 million.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are 236220 (Construction), 541310 (Architect) and 541330 (Engineering), with a size standard of $36.5 million for construction and $4.5 million for architectural and engineering services.</p>
<p>This project will be initiated by a two-phase design-build solicitation. This procurement is being issued as a Total Small Business Set Aside utilizing the negotiated method by issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The solicitation criteria relies upon industry standards, where allowable, to afford the offeror a degree of design flexibility while meeting certain specific project requirements. The successful DBC must design and construct complete and useable facilities, as described in the RFP documents.</p>
<p>One solicitation will be issued covering both phases. Phase One is the pre-selection phase. This phase does NOT include the submission of a price proposal.</p>
<p>Evaluation factors under Phase One may consist of the following: Past Performance, Management Approach, and General Technical Approach.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated in Phase One to determine which offerors are eligible to submit proposals for Phase Two, and an amendment to the RFP will be issued to those selected offerors (maximum of four). The detailed project performance requirements for this project will be included in the amended RFP package for Phase Two.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Factors for Phase Two will consist of the following: NLAE Specific Technical Approach and NLAE Schedule.</p>
<p>The contract will be awarded, based on the Best Value "Trade-off" process, to the firm whose proposal, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, provides the best combination of design features and cost or price reasonableness. In making this determination, all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The Government reserves the right to make the contract award to other than the lowest price offeror, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>Bid Bonds are required. Performance and Payment Bonds will be required by the successful offeror. It is anticipated that the solicitation documents will be available for viewing and downloading on FedBizOpps (www.fedbizopps.gov) on or about April 2, 2018.</p>
<p>Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy. The solicitation and all amendments for the RFP will be posted on www.fbo.gov</p>
<p>Proposals are due on May 1, 2018 by 3:00pm EST., at the George Washington Carver Center (GWCC), ATTN; Angela Wingert, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Beltsville, MD 20705-5124. Due to the heightened security at Government buildings, offerors are encouraged to send their proposals via overnight mail.</p>
<p>If proposals are sent via regular mail, please allow an additional five (5) days for mail scanning. Couriers will not be allowed to drop proposals off at the security desk; they must take them to the mail room located at the back of the building and therefore must do so in enough time to meet the date and time for receipt of proposals. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.</p>
<p>Offerors will have the maximum timeframe expressed in calendar days below to develop proposals in response to Phase 1 and Phase 2. In Phase I, the Government will evaluate Performance Capability proposals to "Shortlist" a maximum of four (4) of the most highly qualified Offerors. ONLY those firms selected in Phase I will be allowed to participate in Phase II.<br /><br />a. PHASE 1 - 30 Calendar Days</p>
<p>b. PHASE 2 - 30 Calendar Days</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the contractor to check www.fbo.gov frequently for any amendments or changes to the solicitation. The Government is not responsible for any loss of internet connectivity or for an offeror's inability to access the documents posted at the referenced website. No copies on electronic storage (USBs, DVDs, CDs, etc...) or hard copies will be made available.</p>
<p>If an offeror would like to be listed so that others can see that the offeror is an interested vendor, the offeror must click the "Add Me to Interested Vendors" button in the listing for this solicitation on www.fbo.gov</p>

<DESC><p>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Distribution has a requirement for the establishment of Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Construction Contract. All work shall be performed at DLA Distribution Susquehanna (DDSP), New Cumberland and Mechanicsburg PA Sites.</p>
<p>The work to be performed under this contract will vary depending upon the type of individual projects (Task Orders) issued during the contract term. However, the following general work requirements can be used to describe, but should not be considered as limitations to the anticipated types of work to be performed: Various construction/building related efforts to include, but not limited to industrial, recreational, general, alteration, maintenance, repair, design/build and new.</p>
<p>All work will be in accordance with individual task order requirements, specifications and drawings provided with each project.</p>
<p>A complete general specification package will be provided when the solicitation is issued.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: <br />The resultant contracts shall consist of a five (5) year contract. Contract ordering period is anticipated to be August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2023. Individual task orders will identify the specific periods required for completion of work. Periods will be established based on the magnitude and complexity of individual task orders.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of construction is more than $10 Million over a five (5) year period of performance.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 236220. The small business size standard is $36,500,000.</p>
<p>The tentative timeframe for issuance of the Request for Proposal (RFP) SP3300-18-R-0003 for this requirement will be on or around April 2, 2018. The solicitation will also establish the RFP due date and time. A pre-proposal Conference/Site Visit will be conducted. The exact date and time for this conference will be stated in the solicitation package.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued as 100% Set-Aside for Small Businesses with a reservation for one (1) Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) and one (1) reservation for a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business (SDVOSB). It will result in multiple awards. The acquisition strategy being proposed for this acquisition will result in a five (5) year multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract in accordance with FAR 16.504. The total combined contract value under this contract is estimated at $40 million dollars. All contract holders will have a total not-to-exceed ceiling value of $40,000,000.00 for the five (5) year period. However, the total amount of work the Government expects to issue will not exceed the ceiling amount of 40,000,000.00, inclusive of all contract holders. Individual task orders will identify the specific periods required for completion of work. Periods will be established based on the magnitude and complexity of the task order project. It should be noted that the majority of this work is seasonal and most task orders will be issued from April through September of any given year.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates award of no more than six (6) contracts. Depending on responses, socioeconomic awards may be made to Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business (SDVOSB) concerns whose proposals are considered to be the most advantageous to the Government, providing sufficient qualified contractors present offers. All responsible small business firms may submit an offer. Award will be based upon a best value basis in accordance with FAR 15.101-2 Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process. The solicitation will provide the evaluation factors for award. The solicitation will also identify all information that a prospective offeror must submit in order to be considered for award. Failure to submit all the information requested by the solicitation may result in the proposal being eliminated from consideration for award. Also, an offeror must be determined responsible according to the standards of FAR Subpart 9 to be eligible for award</p>
<p>Each awarded contractor will be guaranteed a minimum of $5,000.00 during year one (1) of the contract. The minimum ordering limitation per task order will be $3,500.00. The maximum ordering limitation per task order will be $2,000,000.00. Task orders will generally range between $50,000.00 and $300,000.00. Competition for issuance of task orders will be limited to awardees under this contract. Contractors selected for award will be given the opportunity to compete on individual task orders. An award of this initiative is anticipated to be around the beginning of August.</p>
<p>Access to the solicitation package to include the specifications and drawings will only be made available to prospective offerors via the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http: www.fbo.gov. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be distributed.</p>
<p>Any questions concerning this project should be directed to the Acquisition Specialist Joshua Woodworth at joshua.woodworth@dla.mil. All questions should be submitted in writing via email to the above.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are cautioned concerning their responsibility to access the FedBizOpps website for any amendments that may be issued under the RFP. There will be no advance notification of amendment issuance. Prospective offerors are advised to consult the website frequently to check for any amendments. Amendments may be issued up until the proposal due date and must be acknowledged by the contractor. Failure to acknowledge amendments may render your proposal ineligible for award.</p>
<p>All offerors MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) Database at http://www.sam.gov or an award cannot be processed. The solicitation will identify all information that the prospective offeror must submit in order to be considered for award. Failure to submit all the information requested by the solicitation may result in the proposal being eliminated from consideration for award.</p>

<DESC>This is not a solicitation. This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice of an upcoming action in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 5.204.
<p>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.</p>
<p>This Pre-Solicitation Notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>Respondents are advised that NIST will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this Pre-Solicitation Notice.</p>
<p>The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP&reg;) is a program of the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The MEP National Network<sup>TM</sup> comprises NIST MEP, 51 MEP Centers located in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, and its 1,300 trusted advisors and experts at nearly 600 MEP service locations, providing any U.S. manufacturer with access to resources they need to succeed. MEP Centers are funded by a combination of Federal, State, local and private resources; and focus on helping small and medium-size manufacturers (SMMs)generate business results and thrive in today's technology-driven economy.</p>
<p>MEP's mission is to enhance the productivity and technology performance of U.S. manufacturing by acting as a trusted, strategic advisor to promote business growth and connecting manufacturers to public and private resources essential for increased competitiveness and profitability. Centers tailor services to meet critical needs, ranging from process improvement and workforce development to specialized business practices, including supply chain integration, innovation, and technology transfer. MEP's foundation is built upon its partnerships. Centers are the hub for manufacturers, connecting them with government agencies, trade associations, universities and research laboratories, state and federal initiatives, and a host of other resources to help them grow and innovate.</p>
<p>Currently, NIST's MEP has a need for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract to assist MEP in successfully fulfilling their mission, as stated above. One of the principle goals of this requirement is to for the Contractor to understand the current and future development and delivery capabilities of the network. This will be accomplished by establishing mechanisms to discover the current and future needs of U.S.-based small manufacturers and translating that information into actionable strategies and plans to enhance the development, delivery and quality of products and services delivered by the Centers and foster coordination of those organizations that comprise this network. The contract will provide additional resources and subject matter expertise to expand and accelerate MEP's ability to serve as a trusted advisor for U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p>Specifically, strategies and plans will be developed and executed to support expansion and deeper leverage of resources to integrate cost reduction strategies with profitable growth. The successful deployment of these strategies, services and products will further enable the MEP National Network to most effectively serve as the critical connecting point for manufacturers, state and local governments, private sector resources, research organizations, and the federal government. To respond to this expanded need, MEP will, with support from this contract, develop new networks and partnerships that companies require to realize an enduring competitive position in the global market. These efforts will further promote the transition from reactive strategies to the proactive pursuit of increased profits and overall growth by helping manufacturers to understand the value of their marketable assets in light of these drivers.</p>
<p>The major areas of emphasis for research, marketing and deployment of efforts under this contract shall be related to the four key goals of the MEP strategic plan:</p>
<p>Empower Manufacturers: Assist U.S. manufacturers in embracing productivity-enhancing, innovative manufacturing technologies; navigating advanced technology solutions; and recruiting and retaining skilled employees.</p>
<p>Champion Manufacturing: Actively promote the importance of a strong manufacturing base as key to a robust U.S. economy and protection of national security interests; create awareness of innovations in manufacturing; create enabling workforce development partnerships to build a stronger and more diverse workforce pipeline; and maximize market awareness of the MEP National Network.</p>
<p>Leverage Partnerships: Leverage national, regional, state, and local partnerships to generate substantial increases in market penetration; identify mission-complementary advocates to help MEP become a recognized manufacturing resource brand; and build an expanded service delivery model to support manufacturing technology advances.</p>
<p>Transform the Network: Maximize the MEP National Network's knowledge and experience to operate as an integrated national network; increase efficiency and effectiveness in employing a Learning Organization platform; and create a resilient and adaptive MEP National Network to support a resilient and adaptive U.S. manufacturing base.<br /><br />It is anticipated that the Support Contract will be a multiple award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract, with issuance of subsequent Firm Fixed Price Task Orders, as needed throughout a period of 5 years. (1 base year, plus 4-1 year option periods).</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541611 with a small business size standard of 15 million.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates setting this procurement aside 100% for Small Business Offerors to fulfill the requirement.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-18-RP-0011</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation.</p>
<p>Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Lynda.Horton@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>Offerors shall be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) website at www.sam.gov, in order to be eligible to receive a contract under this acquisition.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately thirty (30) days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>

IF YOU BELIEVE YOU COULD FULFILL THIS REQUIREMENT AND HAVE A VALID DUN AND BRADSTREET NUMBER AND ARE REGISTERED AT SAM.GOV, PLEASE EMAIL THE PURCHASING AGENT AT CHIEB@USGS.GOV. The US Geological Survey (USGS)/Earth Resources Observations Systems (EROS) HAS A REQUIREMENT FOR ENVI SITE LICENSE 2018 RENEWAL, UPDATES AND SUPPORT FOR EXISTING SITE LICENSE FOR USGS/EROS, 27914 252ND ST. SIOUX FALLS, SD 57198. The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide this Service.  Therefore, it intends to make an Firm Fixed Price Open Market Award to The Harris Corporation/Exelis. If the USGS/EROS is contacted by any vendor who believes they have similar technical expertise and can provide the same service.  Vendors are invited to contact the Purchasing Agent, Carolyn Hieb, chieb@usgs.gov,no later than 12:00 PM EST, Tuesday, March 20, 2018 with an affirmative answer. 
 
Excerpt from Justification for Sole Source:  This justification is for the purchase of continued annual maintenance and support of ENVI/IDL software licenses in use by multiple projects centerwide at USGS/EROS.

The USGS/EROS has a requirement for continued maintenance and support of the ENVI/IDL software. Software is needed for gathering information from ad-hoc data visualization and data analysis, along with reading, extracting, processing, analyzing, and sharing information from geospatial imagery. 

3.	Description of Need.  

ENVI/IDL software maintenance and support from Exelis, Inc., which provides access to software upgrades as well as technical phone support and debugging, is required for the following Site License.

USGS/EROS has used ENVIÂ¿s advanced Image processing and Geospatial analysis software for approximately 13 years to perform image processing, manipulation and analysis across multiple data formats.  ENVI supports multiple projects and missions across USGS/EROS Â¿ and has Science, Research and Operational capabilities. This software package operates in multiple realms from data validation and scientific research to generating imagery for communications and outreach and providing data processing continuity with all USGS and Scientific entities.    

Exelis is the sole provider of authorized software support and maintenance for the ENVI/IDL software suite and does not authorize resellers of their ENVI/IDL software licenses, or maintenance and support. The annual support required by USGS/EROS includes timely resolution of security, performance, and stability issues, which require the support provider to have access to proprietary ENVI/IDL source code.  The continued use of this Software is paramount to ongoing mission requirements.  

 Creating the same processes we have already developed in ENVI, in a different software package, would require significant time and labor costs and would result in unavoidable disruption to services provided to reimbursable customers.  Production would have to be stopped while we developed and redeployed processes in a new software system.

ENVI has several unique features meeting the GovernmentÂ¿s minimum needs:
Â¿	Working with multiple operating systems including Microsoft Windows, Unix and Linux.  This is important to some projects, particularly those that use ENVI in production environments as these environments typically run mixed OSÂ¿s.
Â¿	ENVI is a commercial customizable software and now includes a number of functions that were built into ENVI specifically to meet the GovernmentÂ¿s needs. 
Â¿	Because ENVI is one of the original image processing packages, has been around for many years and has worked with numerous organizations, it is broadly backwards compatible.  This has been critically important to some USGS/EROS projects such as the Long Term Archive (LTA).  Part of their mission is to find, process and archive older data.  Providing access and processing ability to this older data increases the temporal data coverage needed by scientists to analyze long term changes.  This ability to process these older multi-format types of data using ENVI has saved much labor and processing time for LTA.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) considers employee signatures to be Personal Protected Information, and therefore all employee signatures have been redacted. By posting this document, the Contracting Officer attests all appropriate signatures have been obtained.
