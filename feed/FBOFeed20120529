<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) under the Federal Funded Research and Development Centers policies in support of the Air Force Weather Agency.
<p>This notice is for informational purposes only, Numbered Note 22 applies. This is neither a request for proposal nor solicitation of offers. A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received by close of business (31 days) will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.</p>
<p>The UCAR, through their stewardship of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), is the "Community Coordinator" for the creation, development, and sustainment of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. UCAR is the sole developer of the software architecture framework to this model, which enables its community open design, as well as the sole developer of the Advanced Research WRF dynamical core to this model, which is foundational to Air Force Weather's terrestrial numerical weather prediction capability. UCAR performed this role for the WRF prototype since the late 1990's and after the release of version 1.0 in 2000. UCAR scientists received funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to perform research and developmental type work on WRF since 1997.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the initial community release, UCAR provided continuous software architecture framework RDT&amp;E to sustain an ever growing community user base, as well as, model dynamics and physics improvements of their own. In their role to ensure scientific veracity and utility to community contributions to the WRF model, UCAR ensured baseline model quality and standards through configuration management for all subsequent. UCAR provides coding standard guidelines for all contributors to follow, and provides regression testing prior to an annual release in April.</p>
<p>The WRF model is the core numerical weather prediction model in support of Air Force Weather's Specialized Models, AFW's aerosol and dust forecasting capability, as well as its electro-optics and point analysis intelligence system. Additionally, WRF also is a driver to the land surface model used throughout the DoD and the statistical cloud forecasting capability provided to the intelligence community.</p>
<p>Under this contract, UCAR will provide services to establish and maintain WRF reference configurations; maintain, upgrade, and enhance the capabilities of the Model Evaluation Tools (MET) and provide support to the community for improved verification capabilities; and data assimilation system support and testing. This effort will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF), Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five year ordering period.</p>

<DESC><p>Hill AFB anticipates the formation of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a Base plus four one year options for the purchase of floor coverings with incidental services of installation and removal. To include but not limited to carpet purchase (must meet minimum base facility standards, see attached documents; minimum of 15yr manufacturer warranty is mandatory), Cove base molding, entry mat carpet, thresholds, transition strips, stair nose tread, ceramic tile and grout, wood base and painting/staining and the removal and disposal of pre-existing flooring IAW local and state laws. Furniture moving may also be required for certain jobs and may require coordination prior to starting performance. Asbestos Abatement will be accomplished via the abatement IDIQ contract, and will be done prior to or in conjunction with each project as necessary.</p>
<p>This will be a competitive, 100% Total Small Business set-aside. The small business size standard is 500 employees based on the NAICS code 442210. The solicitation is expected to be released in the middle to end of June 2012. Anticipated ceiling amount for the 5yr IDIQ is estimated at $2,000,000.00. This requirement will have a "minimum obligation" amount for the overall contract which will be set in the solicitation. This contract is expected to be evaluated as lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA). The RFP will also include a generalized SOW for review by all interested contractors. Each task order will have a project specific statement of work. The final product must be complete and usable and all final measurements are the responsibility of the contractor, along with ensuring correct pattern matching and subflooring that will be required. The SOW will only have estimated amounts and the contractor must make precise measurements.</p>
<p>This contract will be for purchase of various floor coverings (carpet, ceramic tile, wood base and including any subflooring stair nose treads and furniture moving if required) all accessories necessary for 100% useable end product, and incidental services for complete installation, at Hill AFB, Little Mt. Test Annex and the Utah Test &amp; Training Range, Dugway, UT. Contractor shall be responsible for providing all materials, labor, management, licensing, certifications, supervision, equipment, transportation, and vehicles for each task order placed under this IDIQ. The service contract act (SCA) will not apply because installation is incidental.</p>
<p>Prior to proposing on the solicitation (or included in the proposal) the contractor shall provide proof that they are certified by a manufacturer to receive product that has the required 15 year warranty. Failure to provide the required certification will result in a non-responsive proposal and that will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Site visit will likely not be required as all information for proposing on this contract will be based on price lists for tasks that may be performed during the ordering period. Price lists shall be good for one year, unless the contracting officer accepts a new price list at an earlier date.</p>
<p>We are requiring a local office in Utah for customer service, warranty issues and management within 150 miles of Hill AFB, UT to provide good oversight.</p>
<p>All text above is subject to change once the requirement is firm and the seed project is known. This is only a brief overview of the requirement and how it will be competed. Please direct any questions or concerns to TSgt Robert Adamson at <a href="mailto:robert.adamson@hill.af.mil">robert.adamson@hill.af.mil</a>.</p>

<SUBJECT>(1) Caliper Zephyr SPE Workstation

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS), intends to award a sole source contract to PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc., (PerkinElmer) 710 Bridgeport Ave, Shelton, Connecticut, for the purchase of (1) Caliper Zephyr SPE workstation. <br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.
<p>The Caliper Zephyr SPE workstation will be used for the extraction and clean-up of serum and whole blood specimens for the analysis of different folate forms for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) as well as other studies. The Caliper Zephyr SPE workstation is a compact fully-automated SPE system capable of significantly reducing sample handling time (and thereby increasing sample throughput) while also improving the analytical recovery of all folate forms. This will help the DLS increase its efficiency and meet its research time-requirements.</p>
<p>PerkinElmer is the sole manufacturer of the Caliper Zephyr SPE workstation. Therefore, PerkinElmer is the only source for this requirement. The Caliper Zephyr SPE workstation will allow our laboratory to improve the analytical recoveries of the various folate forms and to significantly reduce sample handling time from 6 hour to &lt;1 hour and thereby increasing sample throughput. Currently we cannot process an entire SPE plate of 96 samples in one day because additional steps prior to and after the 6-hour SPE process need to be carried out and exceed an 8-hour workday. The Caliper Zephyr will allow us to extract 96 samples per day as a minimum, and even a second 96-well plate could be extracted. The Caliper Zephyr SPE workstation provides integrated waste and exhaust systems that will maintain a safe laboratory environment. <br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide this equipment to Vallerie Redd VIA EMAIL ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 46246 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN June 13, 2012. The Contracting Officer will not respond to verbal requests. All requests must be in writing. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<a href="mailto:Richard.M.Swanson@nasa.gov">Richard M Swanson</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for continuation of Shuttle landing facilities and equipment transition and retirement (T&R).  The contract originally required Lockheed Martin Services, Inc. (LMSI) to provide management and technical personnel to operate, maintain and repair Space Shuttle landing aids and communications equipment.  This effort includes removing all shuttle assets from instrumented runways and accomplishing inventory, shipping and disposing of Space Shuttle equipment and facilities, operated/utilized and/or maintained by the contractor. NASA/DFRC intends to extend the current fixed price/cost plus no fee contract (NND09AA02C) with LMSI for six (6) months, from October 1, 2012 through March 31, 2013, to perform the required services.  The statutory authority for proceeding with this acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements. Lockheeds history with the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) at NASA DFRC extends back over 30 years, since inception of space shuttle operations at the Center.  This experience gives LMSI unique and intimate knowledge of the all Shuttle launch, on orbit, landing and turnaround support operations at the Edwards Air Force Base.  This knowledge derives from Lockheed performing the following significant activities:  Shuttle facilities operations, maintenance and repair, including operating and maintaining the mate/de-mate facility, hangar, hangar shops, warehouses,  aircraft technical training facility, storage and support facilities.   Shuttle landing support equipment operations and maintenance, including the NASA convoy command vehicle and communications/video.  Installation, set up, commissioning, inspections, calibration, operation, repair, maintenance, and coordination of support for all Shuttle visual landing systems, including the microwave scanning beam landing system.  Provide coordination and day-to-day operations of the Shuttle payloads processing, general metrology/calibration system/support and aeronautical energy systems facilities. These activities and facilities are exclusive to the Agencys Shuttle program.	They involve very specialized understanding of the respective operational, functional and maintenance requirements of each activity.   The skills and experience acquired by LMSI in safely performing the Shuttle support services required by the contract, and in performing that effort, are imperative to effectively performing the T & R services anticipated by this procurement. This procurement will require Lockheed to continue the process of safely and effectively dismantling, performing inventory, shipping or otherwise disposing of the Shuttle program facilities and equipment mentioned above.  Having operated and maintained these items during the course of providing Shuttle support services, Lockheed is uniquely familiar with how to most safely and efficiently perform the T & R effort. No other known firm could replicate these services without the government incurring the significant duplicate costs and unacceptable delays and safety risks associated with training and supervising employees unfamiliar with the peculiarities evidenced above in Shuttle operations.  Additionally, replacing contractors for the relatively short-term of 6 months dedicated to continuing and concluding Shuttle T & R services would be unnecessarily disruptive, assuming retention of incumbent employees, due to changes in company compensation packages. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item or service using FAR Part 12.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 13, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	.

<DESC>The intent of this notice is to inform the contracting community that the Government intends to enter into a sole source contract for services to "Upgrade Nurse Call System" to include fire alarms connected to nurse call system at the Huntington VA Medical Center. The Huntington VA Medical Center is located at 1540 Spring Valley Dr. Huntington, WV 25704 and has a need to upgrade their nurse call system on floors 1, 2, & 3 to tie into their Rauland IV Nurse Call System on floors 4 & 5. Rauland-Borg is the manufacturer of the nurse call system and UTC Edwards is the manufacturer of the fire alarm equipment. The fire alarm equipment must be upgraded at the same time.

The Medical Center has an active Rauland IV nurse call system on two of their floors and needs to have the same standard system throughout the entire facility. The purpose of the integrated facility-wide nurse call system is to ensure that if a nurse or other staff member travels outside of their care area and a call is initiated, that care giver will receive a call and respond accordingly. If the nurse call system is not compatible in all areas of the hospital, care givers outside their areas could miss patient calls, which could endanger patient safety. Electronic Specialty is the only local authorized distributor and installer for the Rauland Nurse Call System and UTC Edwards Fire Alarm System in the Huntington, WV area.

The Rauland Nurse Call System is the only system that will allow for full interoperability with all components of the existing nurse call. Introducing another manufacturer's phone or resource location system would cause frequency interference with the currently installed systems.

As a result, the Government intends to award a contract to Electronic Specialty for these services on a sole source basis. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement is 10 U.S.C.(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only one (1) responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), agencies are permitted to utilize this authority contingent upon a reasonable basis existing that the agencies minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation that will be issued; a separate written solicitation will NOT be issued via Federal Business Opportunities. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government shall consider all proposals and information received by 4:00PM EST, June 5, 2012. Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is a viable option. No solicitation document exists and not telephone inquiries shall be accepted. Information can be sent to katrina.cruz@va.gov.

THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  NO SPECIFICATIONS OR DRAWINGS ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

A RFP will be issued to obtain contractor qualifications for which the resulting contract(s), by means of a negotiated, firm fixed-price procurement, will be awarded.  The solicitation will be advertised as 100% Small Business 8(a) Set-Aside.
  Formal source selection procedures will be followed to award to the best value offeror(s) as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 and 36 as applicable.  This solicitation will be issued as N40085-12-R-1701.

The resulting contracts will be firm-fixed prices, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Environmental Multiple Award Contract(s) (EMAC) for Remedial Action Construction (RAC) for projects with the Northeast Integrated Product Team (NEIPT) area of responsibility (AOR), located in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.

Project Description:

The Contractor shall provide the personnel, tools, equipment, materials, transportation, and management to perform Remedial Action Construction services as required and negotiated in each individual task order.
 

Remedial Action Construction (RAC) is the phase of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) process where the site remedy is constructed either as an interim or final action. This phase may include the construction of various soil, sediment and/or groundwater remediation systems that function as containment (e.g. soil cover, RCRA cap, slurry wall, pump & treat systems); in-situ treatment (e.g. natural attenuation, soil vapor extraction, enhanced bio-remediation, air sparging) or ex-site treatment (air stripping, constructed wetlands, offsite disposal, stabilization, solidification).

In addition to performance of the specific services listed above, the contractor will generally be responsible for maintaining records and preparation of written documents such as Operations and Maintenance (O&M) plan modifications, work plans, health & safety plans, sampling and analysis plans (SAP), and waste management plans connected with such services.
 The contractor may also be required to provide proposed solutions to technical problems. The work also includes performing indefinite quantity work such as repair, and /or construction directed by the Contracting Officer via issued Task Orders.
Proposed Contract Task Order (CTO) ordering procedures: 

Each CTO will be initially awarded on a "fair opportunity" basis as outlined in FAR 16.505. Because the initial contracts will be awarded through a rigorous Best Value Source Selection (BVSS) process, we intend to make maximum use of the latitude allowed by the FAR to streamline CTO awards. Typically, only price and past performance will be considered. When required, the government will maintain the ability to employ more rigorous evaluation criteria for CTO awards.

The range for individual task orders $500,000 to $3,500,000.

The solicitation will also include a Seed Project.
  The proposed Seed Project consists of a soil removal action at a closed skeet range at NS Newport, RI.  The project will consist of soil excavation and offsite disposal at an approved environmental landfill, backfill, and restoration of the site.

The EMAC contract performance period will be for a base year plus four option years (60 months) with a maximum not to exceed (NTE) dollar value of $50 million for the total aggregate of all years for all contracts.  Smaller or larger dollar value projects may be included at the Contracting Officers discretion.  The minimum guarantee for this contract for each awardee is $5,000 over the life of the contract.

The Request for Proposals will be available for viewing and downloading on or about June 12, 2012.
  Proposal due date will be approximately July 12, 2012 at 2:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME.  The solicitation will be formatted as an RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by FAR 36.

The RFP evaluation factors will be as follows:

1.  Corporate Experience
2.  Safety 
3.  Management Plan
4.  Past Performance
5.  Price

The Government intends on issuing the solicitation through the NECO web site at www.neco.navy.mil.  All prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  All contractors are encouraged to attempt download prior to obtaining the solicitation through alternate sources.  Amendments will also be posted on the website.  This is the normal method for distributing amendments; therefore, it is the offerors responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to this solicitation.
 The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals prior to award and also to negotiate with any or all offerors.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AN AWARD IS ANTICIPATED WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted, or afforded the opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  All contractors submitting proposals on DOD solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of the contract. Reference is DFAR Clause 252.204-7004.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 562910 with a size standard of $33.5M.

Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities.
 Visiting vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed/renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.
 Further information regarding NCACS is forthcoming.

This solicitation is being advertised as 100% Small Business 8(a) Set-Aside.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT
Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Naval War College, College of Distance Education, intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract to Professors to Go.  Under the authority of USC 2304(c) (1) pursuant to FAR 6.202-1(a) (2), the product or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the government.  
Even though a Firm-Fixed Price/Sole Source Contract is anticipated, interested firms or persons may identify their interest and capability to the Contracting Officer, Ginny Reedenauer, at (401) 841-6022, Email: ginny.reedenauer@usnwc.edu.
A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The College of Distance Education (CDE), Naval War College, has a requirement to conduct eight (8) nonresident evening courses as part of the Fleet Seminar Program in the following areas:
Norfolk, VA  National Security Affairs (2)
Norfolk, VA  Strategy and War 
Norfolk, VA  Joint Maritime Operations
Pearl Harbor, HI  Joint Maritime Operations
Washington, DC  Joint Maritime Operations
Washington, DC  National Security Affairs (2)

The courses are essentially the same as taught in residence at Newport, with the CDE resident faculty preparing the course syllabus, procuring teaching materials, and funding administrative expenses.
  Because the site of the courses is removed from the Naval War College (NWC) it is necessary to contract individuals who reside in these areas to serve as an instructor and local administrator for the courses.  The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, naval warfare operational experience, a familiarity with Naval War College missions and functions, and competence in teaching at the graduate level, using the NWC methodology.

The following Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities specific to each course apply:

Strategy & War  
Ph.D. in Military History, History, Political Science, or International Relations  Desired	
Joint Professional Military Education Phase 1  Desired
Teaching experience in an accredited institution of higher education  Desired
Prior military experience in any Service or grade - Desired	

Joint Maritime Operations - 
Masters Degree or Higher  Required
Joint Professional Military Education Phase 1  Highly Desired
Joint and Naval Warfare Operational Experience  Required
Graduate of Senior Services College  Required
Previous military experience at the rank of 05 or above  Required

National Security Decision Making - 
Ph.D.
 in International Relations; National Security Affairs  Preferred
MA/MS  Minimum
Joint Professional Military Education Phase 1  Desired
Prior military experience at rank of 05 or above  Desired and Preferred
Graduate of a Senior Service College  Desired

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  01 August 2012 - 14 June 2013

PROCEDURES FOR SOLICITATION/AWARD
A written Request for Quotation (RFQ) #N00124-12-T-0288 (Form SF 1449) will be issued in 3-5 business days after this Notice posting.  Interested parties may obtain a copy of this SF 1449 from the FedBizOpps or NECO website or by contacting Ginny Reedenauer at ginny.reedenauer@usnwc.edu.  Even though the intent is for a sole source contract, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the agency.
  The government will award a firm fixed price GSA Task Order or Purchase Order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offeror whose quotation represents the Best Value to the government.  Evaluation factors to be considered will be cost/price, experience and past performance.  The government considers experience/past performance to be more important than price.  However, the government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of relatively superior capability without concern for cost/price.  The relative impact the experience/past performance and price will have on the source selection decision will depend in part on the degree of differences among the competing offerors.

The Line Items on the Request for Quotation may be segregated into smaller requirements for the purpose of awarding more than one contract.
  Therefore, vendors are encouraged to quote on either all or some of the line items listed.  It will be up to the discretion of the contracting officer whether or not issuing multiple contracts will be in the best interest of the government.  

The award date is estimated to be no later than July 11, 2012

<a href="mailto:hill.jennifer@epa.gov">hill.jennifer@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development, National Computation Center for Toxicology, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina is interested in building predictive or multiscale models to predict potential toxicity events within developing systems.  EPA has a requirement for two kinds of experimental studies to support computational models:  assays that generate relevant data to build predictive models of developmental toxicity, and assays to confirm results of the predictions and provide mechanistic support for model assessment.  The EPA requires one or more contractors to use appropriate assays to determine the effects of compounds in the ToxCast chemical library for features relevant to developmental processes and toxicities. These features should relate directly to morphological or physiological defects that manifest during prenatal or postnatal life. Parameters
should provide broad coverage of metabolic and/or regulatory pathways important for embryonic development and potential pathway-level targets leading to developmental defects relevant to the human condition. Of special interest are those targets associated with disruption of processes underlying blood vessel development, neural crest formation and migration, palatogenesis, chondrogenesis/skeletal development, neurodevelopment, and urogenital morphogenesis including male/female reproductive organs. The use of cells expected to more closely reflect in vivo growth, morphogenesis and differentiation of the vertebrate embryo is encouraged.  The award of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contract is anticipated with a 60-month period of performance.  During the contract period of performance, the Government will order a minimum of $100,000 of processing services. The EPA will provide the test 
compounds at a minimum of 3 and maximum of 3000 per Task Order (TO). Each order shall be processed and data submitted to EPA within 90 days of receipt of samples. EPA has determined that this action will be processed as a 100% total small business set-aside competition.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The Solicitation SOL-NC-12-00024, Request for Proposal (RFP), will be available on or around July 16, 2012.  Proposals will be due approximately 35 days after the RFP issue date.  No further synopsis or RFP information will be posted to Fedbizopps. The solicitation and any subsequent amendments will ONLY be available via the EPA RTP Procurement Website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Hard copies or diskettes will not be available.  Telephone and fax requests for a copy of the RFP will not be 
honored.  It will be your responsibility to frequently check the same website for any amendments or additional information that may become relevant.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC><p>Notice of Intent</p>
<p>Ref# 2012-43702</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Procurement and Grants Office intents to award a sole source, firm fixed price contract, in accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 6.302(1), using simplified acquisition procedures, to TNO Locatie Rijswijk, Lange Kleiweg 137, Rijswijk ZH, 2288 GJ, The Netherlands. for a period of 12 months. The contractor will synthesize labeled o-cresyl phosphate ester-adducted peptides as well as labeled phosphate ester adducted peptides. A brief report of the synthetic method that can be scaled up for larger amounts of peptides for future requests will also be delivered.</p>
<p>Peformance Work Statement</p>
<p>Title of Project: Synthesis of Isotopically Labeled Aerotoxic Syndrome Adducted Reference Peptides</p>
<p>C.1 Background and Need - An isotope dilution mass spectrometry method has been developed for measuring exposure to organophosphorus engine lubricants in humans using serum. This method requires peptide calibration standards and internal standards for accurate quantitation. In order to transfer this method to state laboratories in the Laboratory Response Network, these peptides need to be synthesized in large quantities. We are requesting services for the initial synthesis of o-cresyl phosphate ester-adducted and phosphate ester adducted 13C-isotopically labeled nonapeptides to serve as standard reference materials for the full characterization of the method in preparation for future transfer of the method to state laboratories.</p>
<p>C.2 Project Objective - The objective of this project is to synthesize labeled o-cresyl phosphate ester-adducted peptides as well as labeled phosphate ester adducted peptides. A brief report of the synthetic method that can be scaled up for larger amounts of peptides for future requests will also be delivered.</p>
<p>C.3 Peformance Work Statement - Labeled synthetic peptides containing a o-cresyl phosphate ester adduct will be generated using complex chemistry protocols. Additionally, the aged version of these compounds (labeled synthetic peptides containing a phosphate ester adduct) will also be generated using similar complex chemistry protocols. A report detailing these two synthetic pathways will also be generated.</p>
<p>C.4 Technical Requirements - <br />&bull; Synthesis of adducted peptides requires a chemistry protocol utilizing combinatorial chemistry reagents. The protocol for this synthesis is not publicly available and will need to be developed/optimized by the vendor.</p>
<p>&bull; The laboratory synthesizing these peptides must be government-sponsored, approved to work with live nerve agents, and currently using an assurity program.</p>
<p>&bull; Approximately 5 mg of 13C-isotopically labeled reference peptide with serine o-cresyl phosphate ester (&gt;90% purity as determined by HPLC-UV) will be synthesized and delivered; all carbon atoms in alanine will be 13C labeled, with corresponding LC-MS and MS/MS data and brief report describing synthetic method.</p>
<p>&bull; Approximately 10 mg of 13C-isotopically labeled reference peptide with a serine phosphate ester (&gt;90% purity as determined by HPLC-UV) will be synthesized and delivered; all carbon atoms in alanine will be 13C labeled.</p>
<p>C.5 Reporting Schedule - The contractor will report the start and completion dates for peptide synthesis as well as provide communication as necessary during the synthesis of the peptides.</p>
<p>C.6 Special Considerations - The laboratory producing the synthetic adducted peptides must be government-sponsored and approved to work with live nerve agents. Additionally, the laboratory must have a current assurity program in place.</p>
<p><br />Deliverables - <br />o-cresyl phosphate ester-adducted 13C-isotopically labeled peptide, 5 mg; due 1 year from project start date.<br />o-cresyl phosphate ester-adducted 13C-isotopically labeled peptide, 10 mg; due 1 year from project start date.<br />Both peptides should be shipped as powder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Performance Requirement Summaries<br />In general, the deliverables completed by the Contractor will be evaluated in terms of how well the requirements of the contract are satisfied. The COR or COTR will inspect 100% of deliverables to ensure there is a match between actual and expected performance. If there are discrepancies, the Contract Discrepancy Report (Enclosure 1 below) will be used to communicate these performance concerns to the Contractor, and follow through to ensure performance gaps are closed. The Contracting Officer will be kept abreast of the Inspection findings and means to resolve identified performance concerns. <br />Note: Periodic performance feedback given to the Contractor by the COR or COTR conducting inspection may be of great benefit to the Contractor by providing timely and insightful feedback about any "mid-course corrections" the Contractor may need to make to achieve the contract requirements. In addition, the information obtained from such incremental surveillance activities will form the basis for the COR completing the Performance Criteria and Their Ratings form (Enclosure 2 below).<br />The actual Inspection conducted by the COR or COTR includes using Performance Requirement Summary (PRS). See attachment 1:</p>
<p>Task/Deliverable Performance Standard/ Indicator Acceptable Quality Level(s) Surveillance Method Incentives<br />O-cresyl phosphate ester-adducted 13C-isotopically labeled peptide, 5 mg; Timeliness Due 1 year from the project start date Acceptance of the delivery of Peptides Positive report regarding performance timeliness and completion of task.<br />Quality Peptides should be shipped as powder. <br />0-cresyl phosphate ester-adducted 13C- isotopically labeled peptide, 10 mg: Timeliness Due 1 year from the project start date Acceptance of the delivery of Peptides Positive report regarding performance timeliness and completion of task.<br />Quality <br />Peptides should be shipped as powder <br />A brief report of the synthetic method that can be scaled up for larger amounts of peptides.

ITT offices return all unsold ticket products accompanied by a hand written ticket return worksheet. All returns received by AFCTP are manually counted and checked for accuracy. Returns are entered into the system by base using event codes and serial numbers. The current system generates a return receipt for items processed and receipts are then sent back to bases via fax or email. A Vendor Return Receipt is generated by the system for items being returned then tickets are packaged and shipped to vendor. Currently the AFCTP must create an Excel file that records all vendor transactions, receipts, sales and returns on a monthly basis. All information is vendor specific and prices are net or contracted rate.

<DESC>The National Science Board Office (NSBO) supports the work of the National Science Board (Board).&nbsp; One of the important and vital roles of NSBO is to serve as repository and unofficial archivist of documents and records of Board decisions, actions, policy statements and reports on national science and engineering policy issues. The NSBO also utilizes these documents and records to conducts extensive research and as well as to prepare written documents as directed by the Board. Because these records and documents are maintained in various formats, accessing, locating and managing information for research purposes is a challenge. <br /><br />The NSBO is seeking to identify current sources in the market place that could assist it with analyzing and determining the best approach or approaches to addressing and resolving this challenge and to find out if or what type of application solution or solutions already exist or would need to be developed to address it. The (NSBO) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to identify potential market sources and to obtain industry capabilities information as part of its market research. <br /><br />Responses should include a Capability Statement (5 pages or less). This Capability Statement should provide relevant information on the company, as well as a description of recent or relevant projects similar to the one described in the Draft Performance Work Statement below, and indication of whether the firm has a commerically available system that provides these capabilities. Respond via email to: <a href="mailto:GNSmith@nsf.gov">GNSmith@nsf.gov</a>.&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Draft Performance Work Statement</span>
<p>NSBO is seeking to determine the best design and structure for a perpetual on-line Records, Document and Information Management System for managing and preserving National Science Board (NSB) records and documents. Potential structures and strategies proposed in response to this RFI should include an architectural and proof of concept (prototype) design of such a information management system that incorporates the following requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Serves as a one-stop archival repository and retrieval system for all official and designated non-official NSB records and documents;<br />&bull; Is easy to use, and has robust search and retrieval capability from a single, authoritative source;<br />&bull; Is easily maintained and can be administered by a designated NSBO staff system administrator(s);<br />&bull; Provides the ability to easily associate metadata, tag documents by category, document number, etc.<br />&bull; Provides the ability to sort by various indexed categories;<br />&bull; Builds on and interacts seamlessly with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and NSBO existing Sharepoint solutions framework and is compatible with existing NSF IT infrastructure;<br />&bull; Standardizes document and content naming conventions and ensures indexing consistencies across document types;<br />&bull; -Integrates other NSBO and NSF information management systems where appropriate;<br />&bull; -Imposes industry best practices for managing records, documents and information to ensure the perpetual/long-term access, maintenance, preservation, and recovery of records, documents and information;<br />&bull; -Adheres to current principles and industry standards used to manage large volumes of records, documents and information;<br />&bull; -Manages electronic and paper images to ensure data preservation for future references and historical purposes with a focus on consistency and quality;<br />&bull; -Is flexible to meet the evolving information management needs of the NSBO and its staff;<br />&bull; -Insures that the system's functionality and features are designed to support the varied needs of NSBO staff members;<br />&bull; -Supports the retirement of documents designated as "official records" mandated by NSF and NARA.</p>

<CONTACT>Christina Carter-Kurant, Phone 7033052265, Email christina.carter-kurant@fns.usda.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NATIONAL EVALUATION OF WIC NUTRITION EDUCATION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p><strong>Small businesses are highly encouraged to respond.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Office of Research and Analysis (ORA) in the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a competitive procurement for a contractor to conduct a National Evaluation of WIC Nutrition Education. Since 1974, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) has provided supplemental food, nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and referrals to health services to low-income pregnant, postpartum women; infants; and children up to age five. The program was designed to improve birth outcomes, improve the health and development of infants and young children, and increase access to other needed health and social services. Federal regulations require that all WIC nutrition education comply with the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans and promote breastfeeding as the optimal infant feeding choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major study to assess the effectiveness of WIC nutrition education has not occurred since the 1999 WIC Nutrition Education Assessment. Though its report presented some promising findings about innovative WIC services, in 2004 the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) expressed concerns about the methodological limitations of FNS' evaluation of WIC nutrition education and made recommendations that USDA collect data on the nutrition education provided by each program and the outcomes of these programs to identify best practices, disseminate lessons learned, and craft a longer-term evaluation strategy. FNS seeks information on the capabilities of potential Offerors to conduct a study with the following objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated objectives are as follows:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>OBJECTIVE 1:</strong> Provide a nationally-representative description of the major nutrition education processes actually used in WIC, the frequency of use of these processes, and the distribution of use of these processes (geographically, by participant category, by risk and other factors, by local agency characteristics [e.g., size; staffing ratio, etc.], by LWA staff factors [e.g., profession, years experience in WIC, etc.]). <br /><br /><strong>OBJECTIVE 2:</strong>&nbsp; Conduct a WIC Nutrition Education evaluation pilot study with a case study component to evaluate the impact of WIC nutrition education on WIC women's and children's dietary and physical activity habits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>OBJECTIVE 3:</strong>&nbsp; Develop an OMB Clearance Package for a larger nationally-representative evaluation of WIC nutrition education's impact on WIC women's and children's dietary and physical activity habits.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ANTICIPATED DATA SOURCES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The study will likely use survey data, follow up interview data, and potentially document review in local and State WIC agencies. The anticipated data sources are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; <strong>Survey Data.</strong> The offeror shall be responsible for designing a survey with a sampling approach that provides nationally-representative data at the State and local WIC agency level. The latter two categories will be divided into Large, Medium, and Small categories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; <strong>Follow up interviews/document review.</strong> The offeror will be responsible for conducting case studies in a subsample of states or local agencies to examine the processes of WIC Nutrition Education in greater detail. These will include interviews with staff and document review.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice for information and planning purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested partys expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.
  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.

The responses to this notice will be used as Market Research to determine the Naval Surface Warfare Center's overall procurement strategy. All eligible and qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration. Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the quantity and availability of contractors who have the technical level of expertise, the administrative capability, and the management capability to perform the effort described below. Based upon the response to this announcement and capability statement, the Government may determine to set this acquisition aside, proceed with an unrestricted solicitation, or decide on alternative procurement strategy.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division is contemplating a project where the Contractor will produce manufacturing drawings from engineering sketches and Digital Product Definition Files; and manufacture and deliver four experimental propulsors for evaluation at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, which is located in West Bethesda MD.
  Actual delivery location could be anywhere in the continental USA. 

All work will be classified up to the CONFIDENTIAL level.  The principal features of the work include CAD and drafting work, manufacturing, and delivery of four experimental propulsors with associated parts. The propulsors consist of blading and ducts, three to six feet in diameter, and the rotors may be single or multi-piece assemblies, statically cast (two to five thousand pounds), machined by numerically-controlled 5-axis or more mills, and rotationally balanced. Ducts will be produced from plate and forgings, welded and contoured machined.  Work requires precision tolerances with possibly restricted reach and access conditions.
  All materials may require non-destructive testing, and all components will require dimensional inspections with precision 3D metrology methods. 

Capability statements are to be submitted not later than June 15, 2012. Responses shall be limited to 5 pages and submitted via e-mail only to craig.madden@navy.mil .   The capabilities package submitted by a vendor should demonstrate the firm's ability, capability, and responsibility to perform the principal components of work listed above. Packages should include the following information: (1) Business name, address, business size and type (8)(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc., and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number; (2) Demonstration of the firm's experience shown by providing a list of jobs of equal size or larger for two to five different projects completed within the past ten years in which your firm completed similar work.
 For each job listed provide the following: a brief description of the work performed, project title, dollar value of the job, the company name and location; (3) a listing of CNC milling and turning machines and CAD capabilities. Capability statements shall not exceed five (5) pages in length.

The Government will disclose respondents information to only authorized government and non- government third-parties for purposes of evaluation. Information submitted in response to this RFI constitutes the respondents written consent to such disclosure. Non-government third-parties will be required by the Government to sign a certificate of non-disclosure prior to their gaining access to the respondents information.
  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.

When, and if, it is determined that a formal Request for Proposals will be issued, a notice will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. 

Additional Info: There is no additional information available for release at this time

<CONTACT>Adrianne Krauss, Contract Negotiator, Phone 9379045349, Email adrianne.krauss@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The Air Force intends to award a sole source contract to the Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LMA) for the follow-on Raptor Enhancement, Development and Integration (REDI II) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. Award of this highly-specialized follow-on contract to any source other than LMA likely would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling Air Force requirements. Moreover, the existence of limited rights in data leaves LMA the only responsible source. LMA is currently the prime contractor for the development, manufacture, modernization and sustainment of the F-22 aircraft. The REDI II contract will provide for the development of integrated software and hardware upgrades to the LMA-developed F-22 weapon system including flight support at Edwards AFB, CA.
<p>For information on the REDI II requirement, please refer to the Sources Sought Notice posted by this office to FedBizOpps on 26 Jan 2011, which can be accessed at https://www.fbo.gov/spg/USAF/AFMC/ASC/Reference-Number-F-22-FREDI/listing.html. All responses to the Sources Sought were carefully considered before the decision was made to solicit and negotiate with only one source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The contract will have a 5-year base ordering period that will start no later than March 2013 with an option to extend the ordering period for another 5-years.</p>
<p>This is a notice of intent, not a solicitation. The Air Force does not intend to issue a solicitation or provide any further information on this requirement. However, responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the Air Force if received within 15 calendar days of the posting of this notice. Whether this requirement will be competed remains within the discretion of the Air Force. The Government is not responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.</p>
<p>Please e-mail responses or questions to the Contracting Officer, Kristie Furuya, at kristie.furuya@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to issue a purchase order for $212,000.00 on a sole source basis to Century Link at 1801 California Street, Denver, CO, 80202, to acquire the remainder of the Century Link leased Cisco (4) 6504 switches and hardware for the Data Center Consolidation Initiative (DCCI) and to support the move from Denver Century Link Data Center to Martinsburg IRS Data Center in West Virginia.<br />Request for quote(s) will be solicited only from Century Link due to cost efficiencies and need for continuity of service.<br />Sole Source Justification for Century Link and Brand Name Justification for Cisco:<br />The Department of Treasury is leasing this equipment from Century Link and will be moving out of Century Link and taking this equipment with them due to the move from Denver to Martinsburg. In order to do this the equipment has to be purchased. If the Department of Treasury has to buy new equipment from another vendor, they will still be responsible for the lease which is 212K as well as the cost of new equipment. This is not cost efficient. Continuity of service is also critical.<br />The Department of Treasury is in the process of standardizing its telecommunication systems to CISCO products that are currently in use throughout its data centers within the Department of Treasury. This commitment allows a service provider to build a service team with specific brand name skills and experience to the benefit of Department of Treasury and to optimally use that same team to service near term equipment upgrades and replacement. These factors ensure a high quality of service that is paramount to maintaining mission critical field operations. Maintaining a stable reliable environment support by a trained and experienced staff is a major consideration for this strategy and is in the best interest of the government to settle on a standardized manufacture of equipment. As well, the Department of Treasury is in the process of combining its data center per Data Center Consolidation Imitative (DCCI) mandate. The Department of Treasury networks are built predominantly on Cisco routers and switches and uses CiscoWorks as its primary network management tool. The Department of Treasury has standardized and has become dependent on Cisco products as it has invested heavily in its hardware, software, and training for its network management and security staffs.<br /><br />Items to be purchased from lease:<br />

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley has developed a new aircraft design with the engine nacelle over the wing, improving engine ground clearance and freeing landing gear design. While previous over-the-wing designs have produced unacceptably high drag conditions, the new NASA design reduces drag on the wing. By optimizing the nacelle design and the wing leading edge location, NASAs design confines the shock to the leading edge of the wing. Also, placing the exhaust nozzle over the wing reduces noise to the communities below. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, Research Triangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic Relationships Office (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton, Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055. Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and include your company and contact information. RTI is responsible for aggregating and acknowledging all responses.  These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Innovative Partnerships Office within the SRO for the purpose of promoting public awareness of our technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, SRO will follow the formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register as required.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley Research Center has demonstrated a patented method and apparatus for determining the position, in three dimensions, of any point on an optical fiber. The new method uses low reflectance Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) strain sensors in a multi-core fiber to determine how any point along that fiber is positioned in space. The characteristics of optical fibers and the FBGs vary with curvature, and by sensing the relative change of FBGs in each of three or more fiber cores, the three-dimensional change in position can be determined. By using this method in monitoring applications where optical fibers can be deployed such as in structures, medical devices, or roboticsprecise deflection, end position, and location can be determined in near real time even in fibers that may be experiencing external twisting. This innovative position detection method offers 10 times greater positional accuracy than comparable optical techniques.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: Researchers at NASAs Langley Research Center have developed a novel transducer design capable of generating a transverse point load and measuring transverse velocity. The technology was developed to work in conjunction with an accelerometer to eliminate sound propagation through aerospace vehicles, specifically airplane and helicopter windows. Studies on aircraft acoustics have shown that the primary source of internal noise is external acoustic sources that propagate through the windows. Sources include turbulence against the fuselage, pressure variations, and the engines. The transducer works by generating a point source interference pattern along the edges of the window, thereby canceling out the ambient sound wave traveling through the window. The transducer can be readily incorporated into existing technologies for improved performance. NASA is seeking market insights on commercialization of the lightweight low-profile transducer, and welcomes interest from potential producers, users, and licensees. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, Research Triangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic Relationships Office (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton, Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE:
The National Park Service, Alaska Region intends to award a sole source purchase order to YSI, Inc, 9940 Summers Ridge Road, San Diego, CA 92121 for the following items:
1.  SonTek RiverSurveyor M9.  Portable nine-beam 3.0 MHz/1.0 MHZ/0.5 MHz acoustic Doppler profiler/discharge measurement system, dual Janus configuration with four 3.0 MHz and four 1.0 MHz transducers for velocity measurement PART#RS-M9
2.  Bluetooth Telemetry Module which consists of Rover Unit in a waterproof enclosure containing a Bluetooth modem, differential GPS receiver/antenna, 2 rechargeable battery packs. a 1-m processing cable for connection to M9 unit; and a base station with a Bluetooth USB antena and battery charger PART#28-0003.
3.  SonTek RiverSurveyor S5 and M9 systems, 36-in (91-cm) PART#28-0058
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE) Background: The National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) Program was established to provide robust scientific information regarding the status and trends of critical natural resources in the National Parks. There are 32 multi-park networks in the I&M Program. The Central Alaska Network (CAKN) consists of Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, Denali National Park and Preserve, and Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, and covers 22 million acres, or 25% of all land administered by the National Park Service nationwide. In order to track the condition of our parks, Central Alaska Network scientists have chosen 37 key indicators, or "Vital Signs," to represent the overall health of the network. Each Vital Sign falls into one of 4 categories: physical environment, plant life, animal life, or human use. 15 vital signs relate to animal life, 12 relate to the physical environment, 4 relate to human use, and 6 relate to plant life. Underlying these 4 vital sign categories is a focus on habitat change. This focus allows us to predict and possibly model future variations on the landscape. With some idea about predicted change, managers can develop better strategies for resource protection. 
Natural resource monitoring is conducted primarily for two purposes: (1) to detect significant changes in resource abundance, condition, population structure, or ecological processes; or (2) to evaluate the effects of some management action on population or community dynamics or ecological processes. Monitoring data are most useful when the same methods are used to collect data at the same locations over a long time period (e.g. more than 10-12 years). The CAKN Inventory and Monitoring Program is being designed to last for well beyond this time frame.
Three of the CAKN Vital Signs relate directly to rivers and streams, and include water quality, stream and river flow, and the distribution and abundance of freshwater fishes. These three Vital Signs are interrelated and represent different ways of examining change in these important ecosystems. To measure and monitor stream and river flow accurately and rapidly in a large variety of streams and rivers, from small wadeable streams to large, turbulent glacial rivers, the CAKN requires an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), which uses ultrasound to generate a 2-dimensional map of water velocity and automatically calculates instantaneous discharge. Other agencies and organizations that rely on ADCP for river discharge measurements include the NPS Southwest Alaska Network, the USGS, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the BLM, the Yukon Intertribal Watershed Council, and researchers at the University of Alaska. All of these organizations are using the SonTek RiverSurveyor M9, which is specifically designed to be used in streams and rivers ranging in size from small wadeable streams to large rivers.  FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  Per FAR 6.302-1(B)(1)(i) the SonTek RiverSurveyor M9, manufactured and sold by SonTek/YSI, Inc. (9940 Summers Ridge Road, San Diego, CA 92121) is the only Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler that meets the needs of the CAKN stream monitoring program.
Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.
The CAKN requires the following specifications for an ADCP:
- Ability to measure depth to 0.2 meters - Ability to measure velocity in 0.3 meters of water - Dedicated vertical beam for depth measurement - Internal discharge calculation, data processing and data storage in the ADCP head - Dynamic multifrequency velocity measurement - Ability to dynamically optimize the acoustic pulsing scheme between broadband, pulse-coherent and narrowband, depending on river velocity and depth - Ability to be operated using a handheld PDA - In-person training
The RiverSurveyor M9 is able to measure depth in shallower water (0.2 meters minimum depth) and deeper water (80 meters maximum depth) and is also able to measure velocity in shallower water (0.3 meters minimum depth).  With dGPS, the RiverSurveyor can effectively measure discharge in a system that goes from 0.2 m all the way to 80 m.
The RiverSurveyor M9 has a vertical beam for accurate depth/ bathymetry measurements.  Other units do not have a vertical beam, so it has to rely on an average mean depth based on the slanted beams.  This results in the RiverSurveyor having more resolution related to the depth profile and therefore a more accurate depth/ area measurement.  The RiverSurveyor also collects depths with its angled bottom tracking/ velocity beams and therefore has some redundancy/ QC for the depth measurements.
The RiverSurveyorM9, with the SmartPulseHD feature, will dynamically optimize the acoustic pulsing scheme for each sample between broadband, pulse-coherent or narrowband, depending on the river velocity and depth.   This insures the most accurate velocity data for each sample and the highest number of cells/resolution. 
RiverSurveyor M9 has internal discharge calculation/processing and data storage in the ADCP head, and so a continuous link with a computer running peripheral software is not required and no data will be lost should the communications link be interrupted for any reason.   The user only needs to talk with the system at the beginning and end of the measurement.  
The RiverSurveyor can be operated using a handheld PDA, whereas other units require a connection to a laptop computer. 
This purchase will be made under FAR Part 12 "Acquisition of Commercial Item" and FAR Part 15, " Other Than Full and Open Competition is authorized by FAR 6.302-1. The anticipated award date is 15 June 2012.
Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirement are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the product/services listed above. Deadline date for the submittals is 11 June 2012 at 12 pm Alaska Standard Time.
A determination by the government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This Special Notice AMENDS the Special Notice N65236_SNOTE_00048D9E originally posted on 2 May 2012 and N65236_SNOTE_000495F6 posted on May 07, 2012 adding additional documents as detailed in the description below. Submissions are due nlt noon on the 11th of June 2012.  DESCRIPTION Commander Naval Sea Systems Command (COMNAVSEASYSCOM) requires a new Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), land mobile radio (LMR) system to provide force protection, damage control, and flight deck wireless communications onboard US Navy ships.  Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic (SPAWARSYSCEN LANT), acting as the AN/SRC-55 Project Manager/Engineering Office was tasked by NAVSEA to procure this system. The current AN/SRC-55 HYDRA System is a modified, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) trunked FDMA LMR system manufactured by Harris Corporation in Lynchburg, VA. This system operates on a proprietary Harris Enhanced Digital Access Communication System (EDACS) air interface scheduled to be discontinued and replaced with the APCO-25 common air interface (CAI) starting in 2014.  This specification was developed to articulate and document the requirements for shipboard implementation of an APCO-25 LMR system to provide force protection, damage control and flight deck communications. It is being sent to industry in order to solicit feedback concerning the content and scope of requirements contained therein and to thence modify the specification as necessary based on that feedback.  Shipboard requirements include MIL-S-901D, Grade A & B, Class II shock andMIL-STD-167 vibration characteristics, MIL-STD-461 electromagnetic interference (EMI) and MIL-STD-464 EMI requirements, MIL-STD-810 environmental requirements. All fixed equipment is designed to meet MIL-S-901 Grade B shock, be FM Intrinsically Safe Certified, and are compliant with ship's electrical power.  System specific unique requirements include low power handheld radios (20mW/100mW), 380-399.9 MHz, and system ERP not greater than 200 mW. There are three system RF outputs - one mast/external antenna feed and two radiating transmission line (RTL) antenna feeds for internal ship communications. The system uses common transmit and receive antennas. Also required is flight deck ruthless preemption (includes 5MC override and 4 levels of talk group preemption), interface with the 5MC announcing system and ship's telephone network, a VHF/UHF cross-band repeating device referred to as a "linker" to support well deck and small watercraft operations. Special purpose subscriber equipment also includes integrated flight deck cranial/headsets that were designed to operate in noise fields produced by combat aircraft. Additionally, fixed mobile radios are located through-out the ship to provide location-based wireless communications capabilities. 24 position battery chargers are required to support flight deck communications.  The AN/SRC-55 must meet DOD IA requirements and hence must be certified and accredited using the DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) as specified by DOD INST 8510.01 of November 28, 2007. In addition, DOD requires the use of FIPS 197 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption certified in accordance with FIPS 140-2 in all new DOD LMR systems.  The information below provides a list of certification requirements.  SHIPBOARD REQUIREMENTS (1) MIL-S-901D, Grade A & B, Class II shock   (2) MIL-STD-167 vibration characteristics   (3) MIL-STD-461 electromagnetic interference (EMI)    (4) MIL-STD-464 EMI requirements(5) MIL-STD-810 environmental requirement    (6) All fixed equipment is designed to meet MIL-S-901 Grade B shock    (7) FM Intrinsically Safe Certified    (8) Compliant with ship's electrical power (9) The AN/SRC-55 must meet DOD IA requirements and hence must be certified and accredited using the DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) as specified by DOD INST 8510.01 of November 28, 2007   (10) DOD requires the use of FIPS 197 Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)encryption certified in accordance with FIPS 140-2 in all new DOD M-Systems  SUBMITTALS The information received shall be reviewed to conduct objective, comparative assessments and validation of commercial equipment and systems. This RFI is for INFORMATION GATHERING and PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, and SHOULD NOT be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer. The Government DOES NOT INTEND to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  All information received will be treated as public knowledge; therefore, vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI.  Specific information sought includes:   1.

<p>4.3.1. Review Method: The Government will review each white paper and select the Offerors that have the greatest potential to meet the needs of USSOCOM technology requirements based on the areas stated in the BAA. Initially, a determination will be made if each Offeror is technically qualified and has a comprehensive understanding to undertake the development of the technology based on the information stated in the white paper. The Government will determine the most technically competent and capable of the qualified Offerors using the criteria below.</p>
<p>4.3.2. Review Criteria: The Government will review the Offeror's capability to meet the technology requirements using the following specific criteria listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>4.3.2.1. USSOCOM Unique Needs: The Government will review the Offeror's description of the technology and the USSOCOM unique technology need that it meets for the technical challenges of this BAA. The Offeror's facilities and equipment will be reviewed to assess its capability to conduct complete development of the technology, construction of a prototype or prototypes, and proof testing to assure maturity readiness.</p>
<p>4.3.2.2. Innovative or Revolutionary Technology: The Government will assess the Offeror's capability to satisfy the technical challenges and design objectives by reviewing the Offeror's unique, innovative, or revolutionary approach; technical risk and mitigation plan; the ability to achieve technology maturity; and other technical data/information conveyed.</p>
<p>4.3.2.3. Price/Cost: The Government will make a determination of the fairness and reasonableness for the proposed price/cost. The Offeror will be assessed whether the technology development can be successfully completed from the costs stated by the Offeror.</p>
<p>4.3.2.4. Schedule: The Offeror's schedule will be evaluated based on the reasonable level of effort and complexity of the technology; the resources, facilities, and equipment available; and the allocation of time per major task.</p>
<p>4.3.3. Notification of Selection: All Offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the Government, either with a letter informing them that the effort proposed is not of interest to the Government, or with a request for a formal cost and technical proposal by a specified date. Offerors whose white papers are determined not to be of interest are not precluded from submitting a proposal and may request proposal instructions if they so desire. The submission of a proposal not specifically requested by the Government does not commit the Government to review the proposal.</p>
<p>5.0. Step II - Proposal Submission and Review Process: All proposals stand on their own technical merit. The evaluation of each proposal will be based on the criteria stated below.</p>
<p>5.1. Proposal Submission/Format/Number of Pages: Offerors selected to submit a proposal will use the proposal format and structure shown in Appendix B. Each proposal shall include a Statement of Work (SOW) so that the evaluation process includes direct consideration for contract award. Proposals shall not exceed 20 pages, excluding cover page and cost/schedule. All pages shall be numbered.</p>
<p>5.2. Proposal Review, Evaluation, and Selection Criteria and Process: Each proposal will be evaluated by the Government where the proposal must stand on its own technical merit. Each proposal will be evaluated for technical merit using the criteria below.</p>
<p>5.2.1. Category I: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible Offeror with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.</p>
<p>5.2.2. Category II: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p>5.2.3. Category III: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p>6.0. Step III - Contract Award: The Government's plan is to award contracts to selected technologies that meet USSOCOM's needs. The Government anticipates that awards will be made up to 60 days after scientific or peer review of selected proposals. Contract awards will be made based on the following.</p>
<p>6.1. Proposal Awards: Multiple awards may be made based on the quality of the proposals and availability of funding. Occasionally, USSOCOM may be interested in buying only a certain portion (or portions) of a proposal. This BAA method provides the flexibility to make an award for only those portions or tasks of the proposal that are of interest to the Government. You will be notified in writing if the Government intends to make an award based on your proposal. The notification will indicate if all or only portions of your proposal will be included in the award.<br /><br />6.2. Sequence of Awards: Awards will be made to Category I proposals prior to any Category II proposals. Due to the uniqueness of the proposal evaluation process, it may be the case that while the overall proposal is ranked in Category II (or even Category III) a certain part of the proposal may be ranked Category I or II. In this case, it will allow the Government to make an award for that portion of an Offeror's proposal that is of high interest to the Government. Category III proposals, with the exception of certain parts of the proposal (as described above), are generally not awarded. Offerors whose proposal(s) is (are) not recommended for acceptance will be notified by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>7.0. Government Furnished Information (GFI): All GFI will be provided via Compact Discs and will be mailed upon request. For verification please provide the following in the request: full company name, address, Cage Code (and Facility Code if differs), Security Office point of contact with telephone number/email, and level of clearance/safeguarding.

Justification and Approval
Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-l(b)(l) "Single Source"

1.    Contracting Activity:
Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20, for Puget Sound VA Medical Center.

2.   Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:
This is a request for a single source award to PR # 663-12-2-022-0668 in accordance with FAR
6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2, IAW the VHA SOP for Other Than Full And Open Competition dated 3-22-2011.
Urgent and compelling need for Gamunex due to several patients in current therapy requiring the drug within 24 hours in order to continue therapy.   The contract allotment of Gamunex was unavailable as of 7:30am, P.S.T., February 2, 2012 due to the allocation being used up before the facility could place their order.

3.   Description of Supplies or Services Required  to Meet the  Agency's  Needs :
Puget Sound VAMC requires IVIG solution that is sugar free.  Several patients are currently in therapy and Pharmacy does not have enough stock to cover all orders after 2/02/12. 
Line item 1: Gamunex- C 10%, INJECTION 200ML, 15 Vials@ $xxx/g = $ xxx
Line Item 2: Gamunex-C 10% INJECTION !OOML, 10 Vials@ $xxx lg = $ xxx

4. 	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:
The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by
FAR 13.106-l(b)(1). The specific reason for restricting competition is that there is an emergent need with no time for bid.
This product is available as a contract item; however, since NAC has not been able to increase contract supply allocations as yet, a non-contract source had to be acceptable.

5.  Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature  of the  Acquisition
Requires the use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
Mckesson has an established distribution network for pharmaceuticals and has the ability to get
us this product by the time required.  Several patients are in current therapy cycles, so delivery time is critical.

Gamunex-C is the only IVIG product that is sugar free and has to be used to avoid insulin complications in the recipients.

6.   Description of Efforts made to ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential
Sources as Deemed Practicable JAW FAR 13.104:
In accordance with the orders of priority, contracted product was attempted to be purchased but I
was told by the pharmacy prime vendor contractor that no more contract product was available for purchase.
This is a new process and we are diligently researching additional vendors that can supply this product but due to the emergent need, this order had to be placed today in order to receive product by treatment time.

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated  Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable- lAW  FAR 13.106-3:
In accordance with FAR 13.106-3 (1) Oral quotes were received by vendors. Due to the urgent need award was made to McKesson whom was the only vendor who could provide this drug at this time.

8.  Description of the Market Research Conducted  and the Results, or Statement  of Reasons
Market Research was not conducted (FAR 10): See Market research document in file.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:
         Market research shows there are limited number or suppliers that can provide this product.

10. Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest  in the Acquisition: N/A

11. Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent  Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required: Mckesson is a less expensive supplier of Gamunex-C today. Pricing of blood products vary according to market fluctuations.

Requirements Certification- lAW FAR 6.303-2(c):

I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

___________________________________	_____________
Name: Dianne Fowler	Date

Name: Traci Montero

Date 
Acquisition Manager's Review and Approval:  I have reviewed the foregoing justification and find it to be complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief and recommend approval for other than full and open competition.

This is a sole source procurement&nbsp;pursuant to the&nbsp;authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is a requirement of the National Animal Disease Center (NADC), USDA at Ames, IA for 20 reindeer between 3-6 months of age, tested negative for Tuberculosis and Brucellosis, and originate from a common herd. Reindeer must be sound of feet, legs, and eyes; male or female. For acclimation purposes, reindeer must complete a couple of weeks post-weaning prior to transport and possess a health certificate. The reindeer are only available through Williams' Farms. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written (mail or e-mail) responses including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement and must be received in this office within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available. If no affirmative written responses are received, negotiations will be held with Williams' Farms without further notice. This acquisition is being conducted under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:<br />Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as a Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the purposes contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S. C.2304(c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION:<br />1.&nbsp; Agency and Contracting Activity (FAR 6.303-2(b)(1)). <br />a.&nbsp; USDA, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE, NATIONAL ANIMAL DISEASE CENTER, Ames, IA location.<br />2.&nbsp; Nature/Description of Action(s) (FAR 6.303-2(b)(2)).<br />a.&nbsp; This contracting action is to obtain 20 reindeer to be used for research purposes.<br />3.&nbsp; Description of Supplies/Services (FAR 6.303-2(b)(3)).<br />a.&nbsp; 20 reindeer between 3-6 months of age that have tested negative for Tuberculosis and Brucellosis and originate from a common herd. Reindeer must be sound of feet, legs, and eyes; male or female. For acclimation purposes, animals must complete a couple of weeks post-weaning prior to transport and possess a health certificate. Estimated value in excess of $25,000.00. <br />4.&nbsp; Identification of Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(b)(4)).<br />a.&nbsp; 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1.

Various forms of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) have emerged as important diseases of livestock and wildlife. Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) is a TSE which has been documented in white-tailed deer, mule deer, moose, and elk. CWD has not been document in reindeer. Reindeer are needed for a Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) experiment, and previous experiments have utilized reindeer obtained from this vendor. Obtaining reindeer from multiple sources or herds may introduce new variables to the ongoing experiments that may lead to increased variability. Procurement of reindeer calves at a time-point in which they have just acclimatized post-weaning will increase the odds of CWD transmission and comfort with routine handling. Least cost procurement of reindeer on a previous occasion did result in the procurement of acceptable reindeer. In addition, reindeer from this herd have some degree of human acclimation which makes them easier, and to some extent safer, to manage in NADC's current animal facilities. <br />6.&nbsp; Federal Business Opportunities B FedBizOpps.gov (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources (FAR 6.303-2(b)(6).<br />a.&nbsp; A Federal Business Opportunities Synopsis is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required consumable.

The GFE is a Multivac Horizontal Form Fill Seal (HFFS) machine, Model R530-636. This machine is located at the following address:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; MARGIN-LEFT: 39pt; mso-add-space: auto">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Authority</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the rights and responsibilities of the respective parties in monitoring the use of GFE in vendor facilities.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This document will provide the framework for an agreement by and between the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support (DTS) and the successful offeror for the development of sensors and systems to track the use of GFE in vendor facilities. This is a pilot program and will be limited to one (1) machine located at one (1) contractor facility as described above.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Responsibilities/Maintenance</span>:<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"> </em>It will be the responsibility of the successful offeror to develop the best sensors and software to monitor GFE. The successful offeror will have to determine what type of sensor or sensors will be needed for the different types of GFE that are located at vendor facilities. Additionally, the successful offeror will have to determine what type of transmitter or transmitters will be needed for the information to travel from vendor facilities to DTS.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Compatibility issues exist at vendor facilities. An independent or stand-alone data transfer system will need to be evaluated for each location and/or each piece of equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>GFE monitoring needs to be performed to notify DTS-FTGA when equipment is in use, how long the equipment is used, how many items are produced, whether the items are for Government or contractor use, etc.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It is recommended that the successful offeror try several different types of sensors on one (1) piece of GFE. This will demonstrate which sensor will work best in monitoring the equipment. There will be a trial period of ninety (90) days to determine what sensors and software will work the best for the majority of the GFE.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The data that the sensors will track shall include the flow rate and time of use or cycling of the GFE. This GFE is being used on both Government contracts and commercial contracts. The software and reporting system must be able to accurately capture and calculate what percentage of time and/or usage is allocated to Government contracts and what percentage represent commercial contracts.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Live streaming of data could involve connecting a piece of GFE to the internet to allow monitoring from any location on any platform. Assume that the machines will need sensors installed and that fiber optic cabling, Ethernet cabling, a WiFi network or cellular network may need to be installed. Identify how these tasks would be accomplished and the approximate costs.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Batch processing could collect data and transmit it to any email address, send via SMS (text) or upload to a secure web site on a regular schedule (i.e. midnight daily).</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Final end data must provide easily identified tally of government usage of equipment versus contractor usage of equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All GFE is food related production equipment such as: sealers, retorts, or exterior MRE (Meals-Ready-to-Eat) bag making equipment or sub-component die parts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please provide a mock-up of what the data capture would look like in a final report showing usage.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Disclosure Agreement</span>: Proprietary information must be protected at vendor facilities. The successful offeror will be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with The Wornick Company. This document will be provided by The Wornick Company. DTS is not and will not be a party to this agreement. A copy of the fully executed NDA will be provided to DTS.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposals:</span> Proposals are due by 2:00 p.m. EST on August 27<sup>th</sup>, 2012.</p>

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

The Government will not compensate or be responsible for any associated costs of the optional site visit.  Please contact the Government Representative, Mr. Mark Gallagher at 215-697-3286 for site visit information.  The site visit log will NOT be made available to contractors.

As stated in the solicitation, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  In addition, if the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range
exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

The Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) proposal process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition because the best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.
  An overall non-price factors rating must be at least ACCEPTABLE in order to be eligible for award.  An UNACCEPTABLE rating in any factor results in the overall non-price factors proposal being rated UNACCEPTABLE unless corrected through discussions.  An overall non-price factors rating of UNACCEPTABLE makes a proposal ineligible for award.

Questions regarding this solicitation shall be in writing and may be addressed to Jessica Nelson via email at jessica.nelson@navy.mil .  The response date and time for this solicitation is 1500 Eastern Standard Time on 28 June 2012.  Questions pertaining to this solicitation will only be accepted until 1500 Eastern Standard Time on 25 June 2012.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
CONTRACT TITLE:
Purchase of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), Quetiapine Fumarate. The VA Cooperative Studies Program will use this API to manufacture 25 and 75 milligram capsules for use in the P313 Clinical Research Trial (study).

BACKGROUND:
The VA Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) is the Division of VA Research and Development responsible for the planning and conduct of large multicenter clinical trials and epidemiological studies in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA Cooperative Studies Program needs a company to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), Quetiapine Fumarate.  CSP will use this to make 25 and 75 milligram capsules to be taken by active duty and veteran patients participating in the P313 Research Study for the "Determination of Efficacy of Trazodone Hydrochloride, Quetiapine Fumarate (Seroquel), and Eszopiclone (Lunesta) Versus Placebo for the Treatment of Sleep Disturbance in Service Members and Veterans with PTSD."

SCOPE:
The company manufacturing the API (Quetiapine Fumarate) must have a Drug Master File (DMF) on file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The DMF demonstrates to the FDA how the manufacturer meets the regulatory, processing, quality and safety requirements for manufacturing the API. The study Sponsor, the Office of the Surgeon General, Department of the Army (Army) must submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the FDA to obtain permission to conduct the P313 Study. The information contained in the DMF assures the FDA employee reviewing the IND that the API used to make the clinical research product is made under the appropriate regulatory, process, quality and safety conditions.

The CSPCRPCC needs to immediately purchase one 25Kg drum of the API to manufacture 25 and 75 milligram capsules for use in the P313 Study. The first drum of API is needed immediately because the FDA met with the Army in late March.  The FDA told the Army they need to conduct an "in vivo bioequivalence study" using the drug the CSPCRPCC will manufacture.  The bioequivalence study must be completed prior to the start of the P313 study which is scheduled to start January 1, 2013 and must use the 75 mg capsules manufactured by the CSPCRPCC.   The CSPCRPCC must receive the API no later than July 20, 2012 to allow enough time to formulate, manufacture, bottle, label, package, and ship the Quetiapine Fumarate capsules to the contractor performing the bioequivalence study, wait for the completion of the bioequivalence study and then manufacture, bottle, label, package and ship the 25 and 75 milligram capsules to the clinical locations participating in the P313 study so they can dispense the product to patients starting January 1, 2013.  The bioequivalence study requirement was not expected and was thus not included in the timeline for manufacturing the product.

Any delay obtaining the first 25Kg drum of API Quetiapine Fumarate product will seriously impact the mission of the Cooperative Studies Program, the Army and the health of the veterans and active duty service men and women enrolled in this research study by delaying research designed to prevent sleep disturbances resulting from PTSD. The research study budget which includes providing veteran and active service patients with drug product also includes hiring and training employees, and is based upon starting the veteran and active service patients on the drug beginning January 1, 2013.

The CSPCRPCC expects to purchase a second 25Kg drum of the API (Quetiapine Fumarate) in the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2013 and a third 25Kg drum of the API (Quetiapine Fumarate) in the fourth quarter of  Fiscal Year 2014 in order to continue manufacturing the 25 and 75 milligram capsules for the completion of the P313 Study. The CSPCRPCC needs to purchase each additional drum of product approximately 12 months after receipt of the previous drum. 

The API expiration dating impacts the timing of the purchases. The CSPCRPCC must manufacture and package the 25 and 75 milligram capsules for distribution to patients from the start of the study through the last day a patient is enrolled. This requires multiple manufacturing runs. Purchasing the API (Quetiapine Fumarate) in FY12, FY13 and again in FY14 provides additional assurance that the product's expiration date will stay good through the end of the P313 Study.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
CONTRACT TITLE:
Purchase of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), Trazodone Hydrochloride, United States Pharmacopeia (USP). The VA Cooperative Studies Program will use this API to manufacture 25 and 75 milligram capsules for use in the P313 Clinical Research Trial (study).

BACKGROUND:
The VA Cooperative Studies Program is the Division of VA Research and Development responsible for the planning and conduct of large multicenter clinical trials and epidemiological studies in the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA Cooperative Studies Program needs a company to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), Trazodone Hydrochloride, USP.  CSPCRPCC will use this API to make 25 and 75 milligram capsules to be taken by active duty and veteran patients participating in the P313 Research Study for the "Determination of Efficacy of Trazodone Hydrochloride, Quetiapine Fumarate (Seroquel), and Eszopiclone (Lunesta) Versus Placebo for the Treatment of Sleep Disturbance in Service Members and Veterans with PTSD."

SCOPE:
The company manufacturing the API (Trazodone Hydrochloride, USP) must have a Drug Master File (DMF) on file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The DMF demonstrates to the FDA how the manufacturer meets the regulatory, processing, quality and safety requirements for manufacturing the API. The study Sponsor, the Office of the Surgeon General, Department of the Army (Army), must submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the FDA to obtain permission to conduct the P313 Study. The information contained in the DMF assures the FDA employee reviewing the IND that the API used to make the clinical research product is made under the appropriate regulatory, process, quality and safety conditions.

The CSPCRPCC needs to immediately purchase one 40Kg drum of the API to manufacture 25 and 75 milligram capsules for use in the P313 Study. The first drum of API is needed immediately because the FDA met with Army and VA CSP representatives in late March.  The FDA told the Army they need to conduct an "in vivo bioequivalence study" using the drug the CSP CRPCC will manufacture.  The bioequivalence study must be completed prior to the start of the P313 study which is scheduled to start January 1, 2013 and must use the 75mg capsules manufactured by the CSP CRPCC.   The CSP CRPCC must receive the API no later than July 20, 2012 to allow enough time to formulate, manufacture, bottle, label, package, and ship the Trazodone Hydrochloride capsules to the contractor performing the bioequivalence study, wait for the completion of the bioequivalence study and then manufacture, bottle, label, package and ship the 25 and 75 milligram capsules to the clinical locations participating in the P313 Study so they can dispense the product to patients starting January 1, 2013.  The bioequivalence study requirement was not expected and was thus not included in the timeline for manufacturing the product.

Any delay obtaining the first 40Kg drum of API Trazodone Hydrochloride, USP product will seriously impact the mission of the Cooperative Studies Program, the Army and the health of the veterans and active duty service men and women enrolled in this research study by delaying research designed to prevent sleep disturbances resulting from PTSD. The research study budget which includes providing veteran and active service patients with drug product also includes hiring and training employees, and is based upon starting the veteran and active service patients on the drug beginning January 1, 2013.

The CSPCRPCC expects to purchase a second 40Kg drum of the API (Trazodone Hydrochloride, USP) in the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2013 and a third 40Kg drum of the API (Trazodone Hydrochloride, USP) in the fourth quarter of  Fiscal Year 2014 in order to continue manufacturing the 25 and 75 milligram capsules for the completion of the P313 Study. The CSPCRPCC needs to purchase each additional drum of product approximately 12 months after receipt of the previous drum. 

The API expiration dating impacts the timing of the purchases. The CSPCRPCC must manufacture and package the 25 and 75 milligram capsules for distribution to patients from the start of the study through the last day a patient is enrolled. This requires multiple manufacturing runs. Purchasing the API (Trazodone Hydrochloride, USP) in FY12, FY13 and again in FY14 provides additional assurance that the finished dosage form's expiration date will stay good through the end of the P313 Study.

In the letter, the API manufacturer grants the FDA the right to review their Drug Master File on behalf of the organization submitting the IND (in this case the Army) to assure the API they manufacture is manufactured and tested following GMPs. It assures that the tests meet the product specifications prior to shipment of the API. The manufacturer must also supply the Army or CSPCRPCC with a signed original copy of the Letter of Authorization so the Army can include a copy with the IND submission.

v.	PLACEBO - A placebo is a dosage form that does not contain API and thus should not treat or minimize the illness the patient is experiencing.  In clinical trials, experimental dosage forms containing API are often compared with placebos to assess the treatment's effectiveness.

w.	POTENCY - The strength or amount of API in a dosage form. The specifications for the API (Trazodone Hydrochloride, USP) potency of 98.5 to 101.5% are defined in the product specifications. The API must meet the potency specifications through the expiration date.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>

The HQAMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an alternative dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum. These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC><p>The request for quotation is hereby amended to address vendor questions and answers, incorporate a change in the technical specifications, amend the evaluation criteria and extend the due date for quotes as follows:</p>
<p>1. Vendor questions and answers:</p>
<p>Question: After reviewing Amendment I and the new specification 1 for Line Item 0001 which states "Pressure Range: Must cover the range 0 to 200 kPa abosolute pressure, preference shall be given to a Vacuum of 1.5 Atmospheres" - This specification is confusing. If the preference is 1.5 atm, how can the specification state that the solution must cover a 0 to 2 atm (200 kPa) range?</p>
<p>In the Vendor Question and Answer section, the answer to the question is "1.5 atm is the preference, 2 atm would be considered if all other minimum specifications are met". This statement is different than "Must cover the range of 0 to 200 kPa". Please clarify.</p>
<p>Answer: The instrument must cover the range of 0 to 150 kPa absolute pressure. The reference to 200 kPa has been deleted in its entirety (see revised specification 1 below).</p>
<p>Regarding the new item 5 which states "Total uncertainty: at least 0.01% at 100,000 Pa (preference shall be given to a smaller uncertainty)" - Is the product preference for a product whose absolute uncertainty for pressure measurements below 100,000 Pa improves to better than +/- 10 Pa (0.01% of 100,000 Pa)?</p>
<p>Answer: Preference is for a product whose uncertainty at 100 kPa is less than 0.01% (10 pa).</p>
<p><br />2. Line Item 0001 specification 1 is hereby amended as follows to remove all reference to 200 kPa as stated below:</p>
<p>FROM:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity Two (2) each, Controller/Calibrator that shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>1. Pressure Range: Must cover the range 0 to 200 kPa absolute pressure (Vacuum to 1.5 Atmospheres);</p>
<p>TO:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity Two (2) each, Controller/Calibrator that shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>1. Pressure Range: Must cover the range 0 to 150 kPa absolute pressure (REVISED)</p>
<p><br />3. Evaluation Criteria is hereby amended as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria: <br />The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, results in the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>The following will be used to evaluate quotations: Technical Capability and Price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability shall be approximately equal in importance to price.</p>
<p>In determining best value, preference shall be given to equipment that is capable of exceeding the minimum specifications of those stated above in specifications 1 (Pressure Range) &amp; 5 (total uncertainty).</p>
<p>TO:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria: <br />The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, results in the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>The following will be used to evaluate quotations: Technical Capability and Price.</p>
<p>Technical Capability shall be approximately equal in importance to price.</p>
<p>In determining best value, preference shall be given to equipment that is capable of exceeding the minimum specification of specification 5 (total uncertainty).</p>
<p><br />The due date/time has been extended through June 4, 2012.</p>

<p>&nbsp;3.&nbsp; I checked with three different suppliers of electronic message centers none of which could supply the size indicated in the specs. Please advise me which manufacturer was used as a basis of design for the bid.</p>
<p>- The intent is that the sign match as closely as possible the 64x112 pixel matrix of the existing perimeter displays. The shop drawings for that project indicate TruColor Model #818-4. The SOW allows for similar proportion and matrix, if it's not identical</p>
<p>4. Please clarify on the exact size of the double side LED screen height and length.</p>
<p>- Please refer to question 1.</p>
<p>5. Please confirm that the pitch requested is a P12 DIP Full Color outdoor.</p>
<p>- We have not specified DIP, but LED display must meet all stated requirements such as brightness, and adjustable brightness.</p>
<p>As stated in SOW, display must be full color, 12mm is the pixel pitch. Display must have outdoor, weather-resistant, silicone sealed construction, with lockable vandal-resistant access for maintenance activities.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Examples.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

B. 100% Design Projects The following projects shall be constructed from previously completed 100% Design Packages:
1.  Microbial Remediation and Asbestos Abatement This design package consists of a full set of 100% Construction Drawings and specifications.
   I. Building 2002     a. The building has moldy fiberglass pipe insulation in basement level room 005ST and adjacent short mechanical tunnel with access in room 005ST.  Removal of this insulation is part of the work scope.     b. The tunnel to the dining hall on the basement level is being cleaned.  Dining building stairwell is water impacted and is being cleaned as part of the work.     c. The basement level has loose paint and plaster primarily in the stairwells but also in the boiler room and other locations throughout the basement.  This is being removed prior to refinishing by others.  The paint was analyzed in the laboratory and is not lead based.     d. Areas around the fireplaces in the common areas of each of the three wings on the first floor have had water intrusion.  Removing water stained tile and cleaning carpeting is part of the work scope.     e. Fin tube radiation is being removed and sprinklers are being installed as part of the mechanical renovation.  There are areas of floor tile, stair tread, and pipe insulation removal in conjunction with the mechanical renovation.   Routes identified on the plans impact areas finished with ACM floor tile and areas with ACM pipe fittings.  Pipe chases are impacted and ACM fitting insulation is part of the remediation scope.  Dorm room bathrooms particularly on the top (second level) have peeling paint which is to be removed.  Also exhaust fan grilles are very dirty and are to be cleaned.
   II. Building 2003     a. Underground tunnels from girl's dorm and boy's dorm and stairwells are being cleaned as part of the dormitory work.     b. Ceiling in D105 has damaged plaster from water intrusion.  Loose paint and plaster is to be removed from this area to allow for repair by others.
   III. Building 2004     a. This building is currently vacant and more microbially impacted than is building 2002 which has a similar layout.  This building is slated for a mechanical renovation removing the boiler, associated piping, fin tube radiation units and is having a sprinkler installed.  The boiler has been investigated for asbestos and has no asbestos.  There is no known asbestos insulation on basement level piping.  Basement level piping is visibly very moldy and all fiberglass insulation is being removed by the remediation contractor.     b. The basement level stairwells have plaster and have significant visible mold.  Paint and plaster is delaminating in the stairwells.  The remainder of the basement is block or poured concrete with peeling paint.  The entire basement needs cleaning and removal of loose paint and plaster.  A small office area has nonACM sheet vinyl over a vinyl tile floor and an adjacent bathroom.  This area has extensive plaster damage and the floor tile is to be removed.     c. Wing B is the most impacted by moisture damage with loose hallway ceiling tile and moldy carpeting throughout the wing.  All carpeting from Wing B on all three levels is to be removed under remediation conditions.  The carpeting is not well adhered and is not expected to impact the well adhered ACM floor tile beneath the carpeting.  Areas of floor tile are being removed in preparation for the mechanical renovation.  Consult drawings for locations.     d. Wing A and C have some paint and plaster moisture deterioration but much less than Wing B.     e. The fin tube radiation is being replaced and sprinklers are being added as part of the work in this building.  Routes identified on the plans impact areas finished with ACM floor tile and areas with ACM pipe fittings.  Pipe chases are impacted and ACM fitting insulation is part of the remediation scope.
   IV. Building 2005     a. Boiler room was impacted by flooding.  This area is being cleaned as part of the remediation work.  The mechanical renovation plans on replacing the boiler. This boiler needs to be sampled to determine extent of asbestos and is not included in this work.  The main air handling unit is being replaced but the main ductwork section is to remain and is to be cleaned as part of the remediation.
   V. Building 2006     a. There are small areas of asbestos abatement in this building shown on the drawings.     b. There are localized areas of water impact from roof leaks that are being cleaned as part of the remediation.     c. The unit ventilators in the junior high are being re-piped as part of the mechanical renovation.  Cleaning the unit ventilators in the junior high and the kindergarten wing are included in the remediation work.     d. The under floor ductwork in the kindergarten attached section is dirty and is being cleaned as part of the remediation.     e. See drawings for locations and descriptions of work under the remediation contract.

<DESC>Response to questions is provided.

Question 1:   Though student locations (from and to Ontario International Airport) were listed in the contract documents there are few locations that list 20-20 students (Phoenix, Albuquerque, Tucson).  Will the 20-30 students be traveling all at once at the same date or will they be travelling individually on separate dates though there will be 20-30 of them going to the same location?  This will help us reserve the type of aircraft for a specific capacity for the project and propose a budget for it.
RESPONSE:  a.  The required student air travel reservation services are specifically to be provided for students to attend school and to return to their home locations, as scheduled by Sherman Indian High School (SIHS).
b.   SIHS does its' best to have the bulk or majority of the students travel on the 4 designated travel days, or as close to, as commercial airline flights are available.
c.  Incidental air travel services will be needed.  
d.  SIHS student enrollment does vary from School Year to School Year, from semester to semester.

Question 2:   How frequent per semester or month these trips are ???
RESPONSE:  a.   The majority of travel to SIHS and home occurs 4 times each School Year (August and December travel under one round trip ticket; January and May travel under one round trip ticket).
b.   There will be incidental travel for students that are sent home for a variety of reasons; that travel will be sporadic and vary at different times throughout a given School Year.

Question 3:   Would it be possible to obtain a schedule from last/previous year's travels if this project was active last years as well ??
RESPONSE:  See Solicitation Document, Section C  "Descriptions and Specifications",  Item 5 for historical information for School Year 2011-2012.
The contractor must be able to schedule commercial air travel reservation services as required by SIHS.  As identified in Section C, the majority of air travel reservations are for August, December, January and May of each school year; incidental travel will vary throughout the school year months.

Question 4   If this project was serviced last year by another operator are they not interested in renewal or why is it that this year are you looking for a new operator ?
RESPONSE:  For School Year 2011-2012, excellent Student Air Travel Services were provided by another operator.  When addtional services are needed that are outside of the current Scope of Work, the Govenrment is required to is issue a new solicitation.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis for the repair of five (5) Mobile Facility (MF) Shelters and extend the contract completion date for contract N68335-07-D-0006, a Fixed Price Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract awarded to Gichner Shelter Systems 490 East Locust Street PO Box 481 Dallastown, PA 17313-0481 on 8 November 2006, to procure MFs to support the testing and operation of various avionics gear by the Marine Corps in training and expeditionary scenarios. The Government intends to extend the contract an additional six (6) months from 7 April 2012 until 5 October 2012 to allow the Government to order remaining MF units on contract and support the Navy Special Warfare Operations Unit until the new competitive contract is awarded. The five (5) shelters to be repaired are located at the contractor's facility and will be returned to Marine Corp Aviation operations. The basic contract was awarded for a total of approximately 1,000 production units over a five-year period. To date, 422 units have been ordered. Therefore, the orders placed will not exceed the maximum quantities established.
<p>The Government intends to repair units and extend the contract under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1. Award to any source other than Gichner would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. Gichner is the only company that can meet our schedule, as well as form, fit, and function requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Point of Contact is Mrs. Danielle DiLorenzo, Phone: (732) 323-7067, E-mail: danielle.dilorenzo@navy.mil.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District, anticipates aprocurement for the EDR water treatment and system design and construction activities including but not limited to the Design Build of a 6.0 million gallons per day (MGD) EDR water treatment plant. The Plant will treat ll contaminants found in Fort Irwin's ground water in accordance with (IAW) federal and state requirements (i.e.: arsenic, fluoride, and total dissolved solids). The Plant will include an Electro-Dialysis Reversal (EDR) system as primary treatment. The project also includes the construction of the EDR facility with pumps, EDR stacks, filters, and an EDR waste equalization tank. The Plant also includes treatment of the waste stream to achieve 99.8% potable water recovery rate with reject discharge to evaporation ponds. Construction also includes a 1 million gallon (MG) pretreatment tank and a 1 MG clear well tank. Project also includes control building, chemical building, treated water pump station, process drain pump station, standby generator, process piping, and SCADA. The project includes supporting utilities and infrastructure upgrades to the water plant include electric service, siteimprovements, communications, water, sewer, gas, storm water drainage and antiterrorism measures. Commissioning of the water treatment plant is also included. The water system improvements include pipelines connecting the water plant to Bicycle Lake booster station, replacement of expired pipe and equipment, and water supply /distribution system expansion. Other system improvements include improvement of fire flow, installation of a new water well at Langford Lake and connecting Irwin basin wells to raw water transmission lines. Tank construction includes rehabilitation of existing welded steel water storage tanks and repair/replacement of a 1 MG above ground water storage tank. Sustainable Design and Development (SDD), Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, and Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct05) features will be included. <br /><br />The PA for this project is $115M. The cost of design and construction for this project ranges from $100-$250M. The proposed project duration is 36 months. <br /><br />This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Y1NE, NAICS Code: 237110. The size standard for this code is $33,500,000. <br /><br />The acquisition will be conducted under a competitively negotiated source selection. Both a technical proposal and a price proposal will be required. The acquisition strategy is Best Value "Tradeoff." This process allows for a trade-off between non-cost factors and cost/price and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or other than the highest technically rated proposal to achieve a best-value contract award. In making the tradeoff determination all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. It is the Government's intent to award based on initial offers without discussions. Evaluation factors may consist of the following: Past Performance (Prime Construction Contactor and Lead Design Firm) on projects similar in nature; Key Personnel; Small business Participation Plan. The aforementioned evaluation factors may not be all inclusive.<br /><br />Sub-contracting plans are required for all construction contracts awarded to a large business when the award amount exceeds $1,500,000.00. If the offeror is a large business, the firm will be required to submit a sub-contracting plan as part of their proposal package. The plan shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-8 and 52.219-9 and AFARS 19.705. Failure to submit an acceptable sub-contracting plan may make the offeror ineligible for award of the contact. To be acceptable, the plan must adequately address the six required statutory elements and provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to answer affirmatively questions A through H of appendix DD, Part 2, AFARS 5119.705. <br /><br />Downloading the Solicitation: The solicitation will be available on or about 24 May 2012.
