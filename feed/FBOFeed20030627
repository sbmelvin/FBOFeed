<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure services on a sole source basis from Dr. Jay A. Brown, Mishawaka, IN. The Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) offers a variety of toxicology information to the public through the World Wide Web.  This information takes the form of bibliographic files such as TOXLINE and data files such as the Hazardous Substances Databank (HSDB). Most files are not structured in such a way that a symptom developed in the workplace such as “rash” can be tracked back to a given chemical or chemical class and/or type of job. Haz-Map created by Jay A. Brown is such a database and it provides linkage between symptoms, jobs, and chemical. SIS Division wishes to provide access to information in Haz-Map. The experimental Haz-Map web site was made available to the public in May 2002 and since then the file been updated and the web interface has been refined.  SIS in NLM needs the services of Dr. Jay Brown, who is the author of the Haz-Map program. He is an Industrial Hygienist with M.D. and M.P.H degrees, and has experience in the delivery of toxicological information on the Web. The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisition of Non-Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced book as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information.

A - FLEXIBLE NANOCOMPOSITE ORGANIC PHOTOVOLTAIC (OPV) CELLS, SOL BAA 03-32, DUE 091703, POC DR. ROBERT TULIS, DARPA/MTO, FAX (703) 696-2206
  
Program Objectives and Description 

DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of Flexible, Nanocomposite, Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) Cells.  The goal of this program is to efficiently convert solar energy to electricity utilizing nanocomposite materials on a flexible, lightweight substrate. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in performance, device design, and manufacture.  Specifically excluded from this program is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state-of-practice.  Approaches specifically not of interest to this program are those that utilize aqueous or gel-based electrolytes and traditional, inorganic-based, thin¡Vfilm photovoltaics.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the area of flexible, nanocomposite, organic, solid-state, electronic materials and devices for future implementation in solar cells for military applications.  For example, Special Operations teams now use batteries to power mission-critical equipment such as encrypted radios, laser designators, GPS navigation sets, etc. On a mission of several days, these batteries can make up about half the weight carried by a team. Current mission planning must trade off the heavier weight of rechargeable batteries versus the greater number of expendable batteries required. In logistics studies for a typical desert reconnaissance mission, a recharging system powered by efficient solar cells would allow battery weight to be reduced by more than a factor of two. The weight savings would allow greater amounts of ammunition, water, clothing, or food to be carried by the Special Operations team. When teams operate for extended periods in denied areas, efficient solar cells increase the level of covertness by allowing less frequent re-supply. To meet these requirements, the solar cells must be flexible, lightweight, durable, and low cost.

The goal of this program is to develop organic, nanocomposite, photovoltaic cells that perform competitively with inorganic semiconductor cells (high efficiency, high carrier mobilities, efficient charge separation, and high photochemical stability), but will be flexible, lightweight, and low cost and processed like a polymer.  While conventional, inorganic, solar cells have improved over the years they remain costly and energy intensive to manufacture.  Nanocomposite materials are attractive for photovoltaics because of the potential of high throughput, non-vacuum processes using reel-to-reel, spray deposition, or other low cost processes.   These material systems also offer the potential for very thin and flexible photovoltaic devices with high energy densities.  

The goal of this program is to demonstrate significant advances in photovoltaic device performance utilizing nanocomposite organic cells in a flexible form.  For the purposes of this program, the term nanocomposite will include organic nano-materials in organic matrices or inorganic nano-particles in organic matrices with an unspecified format (thin films, bulk mixtures, etc).  The organic matrix may be an active electronic/photonic material or an inactive binder containing the active components.  The overall performance goal for this program is to demonstrate flexible solar cells with external cell efficiencies of 20% and above.   The demonstrated device will be flexible (bend around a 1 cm radius), lightweight (0.1kg/m2), and have good environmental stability (3 months continuous operation).  The final device design may include multiple photoactive layers (single side illumination) to meet the performance goals. The program is planned as a four phase, 5-year, effort with performance goals and metrics defined for each year's effort.  

At the end of Phase 1 (12 months), the PV cell efficiency (coupon size (1 cm2); flexible substrate - does not have to be plastic or exhibit environmental stability) goal is 6%.  The PV cell efficiency will be measured using standard test conditions that include a cell temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, an incident illumination level of 1000 W/m2, and a spectrum defined by AM1.5.  The cell efficiency will be independently verified by a DARPA sponsored Government laboratory.  Meeting the performance goals in each phase will be required for the program to continue to the next phase.  The success or failure to meet performance goals will constitute a GO/NO-GO decision at the end of each phase of the program.  

At the end of Phase II (an additional 12 months) the GO/NO-GO efficiency performance goal is 10% on a flexible plastic substrate (2.5 cm x 5 cm).  Phase III (an additional 12 months) will improve photovoltaic materials and devices to provide an efficiency of 15% (2.5 cm x 5 cm).  Phase IV is an additional 24 month effort that will demonstrate a PV cell efficiency of 20% (2.5 cm x 5 cm) and meet the requirements of flexibility, weight, and stability.  In Phases III and IV methods must be identified for transition to large area devices (1 m2) and cell designs developed for solar powered battery chargers relevant to military applications.  

Areas of interest important to meeting the performance goals include (but are not limited to) high electron and hole mobility materials, designs for the efficient charge separation, improvements in excition diffusion properties, methods to reduce recombination, materials to maximize solar absorption efficiency, materials and designs to significantly reduce resistive loses, improvements in flexible, transparent, high conductivity electrodes, and materials to enhance the stability of organic solar cells to environmental conditions. Other areas of interest include the control of three-dimensional nanostructures, new methods to image resulting nanocomposite structures, and new approaches for fabrication and manufacture of organic-based solar cells.

DARPA strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration all significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations.  Teaming among academic, industrial and/or government partners is encouraged, and it is anticipated that the contributions of the team members are complementary as well as essential to the critical path of the research plan. Foreign owned, controlled, or influenced (FOCI) firms are advised that security restrictions may apply that could preclude their participation in these efforts.   A technology insertion plan is encouraged and research that holds promise of insertion into Department of Defense (DoD) relevance is of great interest.

Program Scope

The Flexible Nanocomposite Organic Photovoltaic (OPV) Cells Program will consist of a Phase I effort (12 months) followed by an optional Phase II (an additional 12 months), Phase III (an additional 12 months) and Phase IV (an additional 24 months) for those efforts that meet the performance goals and appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to DoD.  Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II, Phase III, and Phase IV should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase).  Awards are expected to be made during the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are strongly encouraged.  A web site - http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-03-32-OPV/ - has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Robert Tulis, phone: (703) 696-2347, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: rtulis@darpa.mil.

<DESC>NA HQ, Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) intends to issue and RFP for a  Defense Personal Property System (DPS). DPS will employ cutting edge technology and best practices to build a single, paperless DoD personal property program that integrates and  automates all processes that support DoDÃ¢Â€Â™s familiesÃ¢Â€Â™ moves worldwide.  DoD uses over 900 transportation providers (TP) for movement and storage services.  Management of such a vast number of providers has resulted in complex processes to qualify  TPs, solicit rates, distribute traffic, evaluate performance, pay bill and settle claims.  MTMC currently operates one legacy information technology (IT) system to support management of these personal property shipments.  The Transportation Operational Pe rsonal Property Standard system (TOPS) was developed to manage all DoD personal property movements.  Over 200 Personal Property Shipping Offices currently utilize TOPS.  MTMC is also currently developing the Centralized Web Application (CWA) as an interim web-based solution to integrate with TOPS to handle the automated approval of shipments and cost shipments using a Government rating engine.  The CWA also interfaces with U.S. BankÃ¢Â€Â™s PowerTrack, a web-based commercial business-to-business payment syst em.  MTMC is looking to replace TOPS and the CWA functionality with an end-to end, web-based solution.  MTMC is seeking an independent organization to provide a commercial solution to meet MTMCÃ¢Â€Â™s DPS requirements and then operate and maintain the serv ice for DoD.  MTMC desires to maximize use of Ã¢Â€Âœbest-of-breedÃ¢Â€Â commercial software and limit customization to unique, unavoidable DoD requirements.  MTMC generally desires to change business practices rather than customize the commercial solution.   MTMC expects the final integrated services to be delivered 185 business days after performance start date; this includes meeting all security and accreditation requirements.  The contractor will have the capability to (1) perform integration, testing, an d implementation parallel with continuing legacy system operations. (2) Host the service off-site at a third-party location, and (3) build upon DPS service capabilities by incorporating the functionality of selected systems into the DPS service in the futu re.  The period of performance is expected to include a base period and nine 1-year option periods.  This invitation to comment on the draft Statement of Work will be used for planning purposes only.

<DESC>This announcement serves as notice to all potential offerors that, on or about 15 July 2003, the Airborne Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Program Office, Global Grid Product Area Directorate, Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts anticipates release of the Request for Proposal (RFP) F19628-03-R-0052 for the Airborne JTRS Cluster 4 Pre-System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase.  Using a two-part development strategy, the Airborne JTRS program will provide a scalable, modular family of networked radios to all Services airborne platforms.  The Pre-SDD acquisition is focused on a preliminary design for a modular, scalable family of Cluster 4 radios, collection and analysis of airborne platform requirements and constraints, and architectures for the airborne network.  The results from the Pre-SDD phase (networking attributes, platform interface requirements, and modular design) will feed directly into the Government's SDD planning. For SDD, the Government plans to conduct a full and open competition to select a single prime system contractor, who will qualify at least two JTR production sources, to focus on post-PDR design, testing, certification and Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) of modular Airborne JTRS radio systems to meet users' needs and to incorporate features to support network-centric operations. The Pre-SDD effort will initiate development through Preliminary Design Review (PDR) no later than nine (9) months after contract award.  The Pre-SDD acquisition will follow the competitive procedures of FAR Part 15 and associated supplements and utilize full and open competition.  The Government plans to award two (2) cost plus award fee (CPAF) contracts, executed concurrently and conducted independently by the contractors, to complete the Pre-SDD effort.  There will be a requirement for data deliveries consisting primarily of technical reports, specifications, and interface control documents.  The solicitation will be posted on the Internet at the Hanscom Electronic Request for Proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB) website: http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil.  Under "Business Opportunities", set "Type" and "Location" to "ALL", click "Go", and then scroll down to "Airborne Joint Tactical Radio System."  In addition, the solicitation will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Offerors will be provided thirty (30) days to respond to the solicitation.  The Government will request that offeror's proposals remain effective for 120 days following receipt by the Government.  Telephone requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  Foreign-owned firms, including Canadian sources, will not be eligible to compete.  Interested contractors desiring business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System. The Pre-SDD effort requires access to the following classified information: Unified Information Security (INFOSEC) Criteria (UIC). The Government will post on the HERBB a copy of a DD Form 254 to be downloaded for contractor completion of blocks 6a, 6b, and 6c.  The completed DD Form 254 shall be submitted via facsimile to Mr. Richard Fox, ESC/DIGK Contracting Officer, at 781-377-2657.  Upon verification of the DD Form 254, the Government will contact the offeror to set up an appointment for offeror's review at Hanscom AFB, MA at a date no earlier than the release of the RFP.  A hard copy of the completed DD Form 254 shall be provided with the submission of the proposal. The Pre-SDD effort requires access to certain waveform specifications and other documentation with Government Purpose Rights.  The offeror will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements before any Government Purpose Rights data/information is released to an offeror, per DFARS 227.7013-7 and 252.227-7013(b)(2)(iii)(A). This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  It does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, offerors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

Date for receipt of proposals:  Wednesday, August 27, 2003

The National Transit Institute (NTI) is seeking proposals to develop and deliver a two-day training course entitled “Intelligent Transportation Staffing” (ITS).

 Since human resources are the key to successful deployment of ITS in an agency, it is important that organizations have people in place who know how to use the technology, interpret the data, and derive the optimum benefits from the system.  These staffing needs transcend all departments.  How does an agency which is planning an ITS procurement ensure that its organization is appropriately staffed to ensure a successful and profitable deployment?

Often a technology product is purchased without staffing, maintenance and operations involved in the basic design and functionality of the system.  Most agencies tend to use in-house personnel for implementation. These personnel, while capable, may not have the background necessary in ITS projects. This leads to un- or ill-trained staff being asked to adopt a new product (in addition to their existing workload) without having any buy-in to the product or process.   

On the reverse side, often times, technology is not purchased because agencies do not know the staffing implications of procuring a specific technology.  This further adds to the mystique of such purchases and creates another barrier to automating processes.

Everyone involved in a project must have a clear participatory role and a good understanding of the scale of the project.  Technology deployments are not about the technology they are about the people who must adopt the tools and processes to add value to their work and their customers. It is important to clearly recognize the staffing levels and associated costs at the beginning of a project and include the staffing and training program in the budget and schedule from the start in order to improve project success and manage the transition from “build” to “operate.”

The course will be offered to transit managers from all levels, human resource personnel, employees assigned to an ITS project who need additional personnel, consultants/technical assistance people, decision makers, project management staff (includes system designers, engineers, end users and maintainers), and staffs of state DOTs, MPOs, city, county and municipal governments.  

To obtain a copy of the complete RFP, send a written request on organization letterhead to the University Procurement and Contracting address above.  Fax or e-mail requests will be accepted. Telephone requests are unacceptable.  RFPs will not be faxed.  Requests will be honored if received by July 25, 2003.  RFPs will be mailed out shortly thereafter. Rutgers University is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to provide opportunities to small businesses, minority-owned businesses and/or female-owned businesses.  These businesses are encouraged to submit proposals.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Proposal (RFP) number is RFQ-DC-03-00270 and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-03. The EPA intends to award a Purchase Order ("contract") on the basis of "brand name or equal" for on-line  environmental news and public policy subscription services for a period of four (4) months (commencing August 1, 2003) with two (2) four month options. The term "brand name" includes  identification of products/services by descriptive name.  Such identification is intended to be descriptive, not  restrictive, and to indicate the quality and characteristics of products/services that will be satisfactory to the EPA.  Any proposal offering "equal" products/services will be considered if such products/services are clearly identified in the proposal and are determined by the EPA to meet fully  the salient characteristic requirements listed in this combined synopsis/solicitation. If the offeror proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be provided in the proposal. If a vendor proposes to modify a product to make it conform to the  requirements of this synopsis/solicitation, it must  include a clear description of such proposed modifications in its proposal and must clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications. All proposals will be considered and the EPA reserves the right to request samples or  tests of the products/services. The brand name product/services desired by the EPA is an on-line subscription to the "Greenwire" and "Environment and Energy Daily" services published by E&E Publishing, LLC.  The particular  characteristics of these brand name products/services, which meet all EPA  requirements, can be ascertained by visiting www.eenews.net, the website for E&E Publishing, LLC.  The salient characteristics of the products/services and EPA requirements are: on-line current awareness services in both environment and public policy; on-line subscription service available through  Internet-Protocol (IP) recognition to all EPA staff (18,000 employees with approximately 4,000 primary users); summaries and analysis of the national media coverage on environmental topics and issues of the day (summaries and analyses must be comprehensive and include information from all major  news outlets including national and regional newspapers as well as other publications providing coverage of the environment); summaries and analyses of national political news and issues of the day (summaries and analyses must be timely and comprehensive and include information from all the major  political bodies including the federal executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as major campaign events and state actions); website must reflect events and developments from the preceding 24-hour period and include, where appropriate, original reporting and analysis of the implications  of both proposed and completed actions.   The following FAR Clauses apply to this acquisition: 52.212-1; 52.212-3 with its Alternate III (each offer shall include a completed copy of 52.212-3); 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 (incorporating by reference Subparagraphs (a1, a2, b1, b13, b14, b15 and b16).  In  addition, FAR Clause 52.212-2 is incorporated by reference and applies to this combined synopsis/solicitation.  Subpart (a) of FAR Clause 52.212-2 is amended to read: The Government will award a contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer  conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical (frequency of updates to the site, number of media outlets reviewed for relevant materials, availability of original  reporting and analysis of issues,  number of sources and areas covered for relevant materials, usability of the site and user feedback on its value to the daily work of EPA staff, availability of customizable features including e-mail updates and notifications, vendor technical support and  assistance, availability of usage statistics, ability of the vendor to sign multi-year agreements, compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (for accessibility by the disabled), Past Performance and Price. Technical and Past Performance (listed in descending order of precedence) is more  important than price. For the sake of clarity, subpart (b) and (c) of 52.212-2 remain as written. In addition, FAR Clause 52.217-9 will be included in the contract.  For purposes of this combined synopsis/solicitation and the resulting Purchase Order, the Government may extend the term of this  contract within 15 days of expiration of the contract; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires.  The preliminary notice does not commit the government to an extension. If the Government  exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.  The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause shall not exceed one (1) year. (End of FAR Clauses for purposes of this combined synopsis/solicitation).  Additional requirements: Warranty: The contractor shall extend to the EPA full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranties are available at no additional cost to the EPA. Acceptance of the standard commercial warranty does not  waive EPA rights under the "Inspection" clause nor does it limit the EPA's rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the standard commercial warranty. The standard commercial  warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable product listed in the synopsis/solicitation. An original and one (1) copy of the proposal are due by 3:00 P.M., EST, July 11, 2003.  Proposals are acceptable in the following format: e-mail, mail or hand delivery.

A.	BACKGROUND
The Library of Congress Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division operates a full service motion picture conservation center located on Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton Ohio. The Conservation Center consists of two units, the Film Vaults (building 167, area B) and the Preservation Laboratory (building 682, area B). 

The primary purpose of the Center is to conserve, preserve, and restore the Library=s nitrate film archive, the largest of its kind in the United States.

Over 120 million feet of highly flammable nitrate motion picture film is stored in the Film Vaults. The Laboratory repairs and copies the nitrate film onto modern safety film stocks, which are non-flammable and less prone to deterioration. Approximately 3/4 of a million feet of nitrate film is copied per year in the Laboratory. Much of this copying work is accomplished using continuous contact full immersion motion picture printers.

Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firms(s) will be required to purchase the existing system from the Government and may be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the Government.

The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor(s) shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The Contractor(s) proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.

Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation:  General Mitchell ANGB, WI
Location: Milwaukee, WI
Installation Description:  General Mitchell ANGB consists of three parcels of land totaling 109.9 acres.  The land located east of the airport runways consists of two parcels.  The northern 58.5 acre parcel holds the apron, hangar and most of the buildings.  The southern 46.5 acre parcel is an old landfill, is not developed and is not expected to be developed in the future.  There are 26 commercial and industrial buildings totaling 277,744 square feet on the base.  There are no living quarters on the base.
Utility systems to be privatized: 
a.	Electric:
Power for the ANGB is supplied by Wisconsin Electric Power Company.  The system is comprised of a combination of overhead and underground electric lines, and pole and pad mounted transformers.  The ANGB contains approximately 2,900 lineal feet of above ground power lines and 1,700 lineal feet of underground power lines.  The ANGB contains approximately 15 transformers.

This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal for the approved parts, McDonnell Douglas (02731) P/N 7-311F00004 and Honeywell International (07187) P/N 4032300-951, which will be considered.  

The letter RFP opens on June 30, 2003 and closes at 1:00 p.m. on July 30, 2003.  The solicitation is for 106 each Multiplex Data Links, and includes a 200% quantity option (212 each).  The FOB point and Inspection and Acceptance points are Origin.

<DESC>This document serves as a formal Pre-Solicitation Notice for SSA-RFP-03-0539. On January 2, 2003 the Social Security Administration published an Initial Public Announcement for an A-76 Full Cost Comparison Study for Information Technology Help-Desk Services In the FedBizOps forum (Reference Number: SSA-A76-HELPDESK), and on July 27, 2003 SSA published a modification to this Initial Public Announcement. The Help-Desk services under study support all SSA users of information technology, specifically in the identification, diagnosis, and resolution of problems involving information technology hardware and software. The incumbent service provider currently performing the activity under study is the Social Security Administration/ Office of Systems. The activity under study is currently provided at the Social Security Administration’s headquarters in Woodlawn, MD and at six Remote Operations Communications Centers located in: Philadelphia, PA; Richmond, CA; Birmingham, AL; Jamaica, NY; Chicago, IL; Kansas City, MO. At the time of this announcement the number of Government personnel (FTEs) performing the activity is sixty-eight (68) These incumbent Government service provider FTEs are augmented by private sector contractor staff numbering forty-seven (47) persons. All of the Government FTEs and contractor personnel identified herein are subject to this A-76 study. SSA anticipates release of a formal solicitation/ Request For Proposals, SSA-RFP-03-0539, for this A-76 Standard Competition in the FedBizOps forum on or about July, 17, 2003. 

The Social Security Administration anticipates awarding a one year firm-fixed price contract, with four option years for Information Technology Help-Desk Services. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541519, “Other Computer Related Services”, with a size standard of $21,000,000.00. SSA’s market research and analysis has identified multiple potential small businesses, either solely or in partnership arrangements, that appear capable of meeting the Government’s requirements. As a result of this analysis, this procurement will be a 100% small business set-aside, as prescribed at FAR 19.502-2. (See Number Note 1) 


Additional information regarding this study, specifically a DRAFT copy of the Performance Work Statement (PWS), is contained as an attachment to this pre-solicitation announcement (file name: DRAFT SSA A-76 Help-Desk PWS.doc). Interested parties are encouraged to reference this attached document, and provide comments or questions, regarding this pre-solicitation notice or the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement, by COB 7/7/03.  All inquires, comments, and questions must be directed in writing, via email, to SSA Contract Specialist Randy Pickwell, at Randall.Pickwell@.ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA As stated in the FedBizOpps notice issued June 20, 2003, after review of all Capabilities Statements, those offerors deemed "Best Qualified" will be invited to continue in this acquisition process.  After the notification and prior to submission of proposal(s) the Government will afford each of those offerors, deemed best qualified, and their team members, an opportunity to attend a one-on-one due diligence session with key program personnel.  The due diligence process will allow the offerors to gain a better understanding of the mission objectives and existing conditions associated with the requirements, prior to submitting a proposed solution.  During one-on-one sessions, a major objective of the due diligence process is to provide offerors and their team members the ability to ask questions that by their very nature they would not ask if the response would be posted and provided to their competition.  As such, if the offeror notifies the Government that the questions it intends to ask during the one-on-one sessions are proprietary and whose release would identify confidential business strategies, or approaches, the questions and responses will be protected and held confidential.  The Government is interested in bringing "best commercial practices" to play in achieving our goals while allow offerors to apply their own unique abilities during due diligence and to develop unique solutions to meet the Government's needs.  Offerors are encouraged to bring both questions and suggestions to the one-hour due diligence meeting and be prepared for an open dialogue with the Government.  Requests for clarification and or information that result in specific information necessary for preparation of proposals is disclosed to one or more potential offeror, that information will be made available to the public as soon as practicable, but no later than the next general release of information, in order to avoid creating an unfair competitive advantage.  The Government will provide competing offerors equal access to data and information.  The Government assumes no responsibility for any representation made by any of its officers or agents during due diligence.  Offeror questions and Government responses furnished during due diligence are unofficial.  If requested, the Government will attempt to provide an official response within the due diligence time period.  The time frame for the due diligence session(s) has not currently be scheduled, therefore, additional information will be provided to those vendors invited to continue.  Also, this amendment to the prior notice also corrects the reference from "FAR 12.208" to "FAR 12.207" which states, "Agencies shall use firm-fixed-price contracts or firm-fixed price contracts with economic price adjustment for the acquisition of commercial items".  Therefore, be advised that the Government anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed-Price contract for this acquisition. Also, the Government has provided a draft document for informational purposes only, entitled, Procurement and Support Services Division Process Document, Process Invoices for Payment.  This document can be obtained at http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp.

2)	equipment needed for the care of children with type 2 diabetes (including glucose meters and strips, syringes, lancets, urine ketone strips, concentrated glucose solution for performing oral glucose tolerance tests, topical anesthetic cream for blood drawing, automated blood pressure devices and cuffs, automated scales),
3)	equipment required to measure the effects of lifestyle change (including mechanically breaked cycle ergometers, heart rate monitors and electronic metronomes for performing PWC, accelerometers, pedometers),
4)	materials to create a “toolbox” to be utilized to enhance the ability of underprivileged children to attain lifestyle changes, particularly increased physical activity (including sneakers, jump ropes, etc.)

STUDY GOAL: The overall goal of this study is to evaluate potential treatment modalities for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, to determine the safest and most efficacious options for treatment. Twelve clinical centers will enroll a total of approximately 750 patients. For medical care, subjects will be seen every 2 months during the first year, and every 3 months during the subsequent years. The total duration of the trial is 5 years. The primary outcome will be related to the achievement and maintenance of glycemic control; numerous important secondary outcomes will also be evaluated, including preservation of beta cell function, side effects and quality of life, markers for vascular complications, and cost effectiveness. 
	Applicants for a Clinical Trial Agreement to support this clinical trial must include a description of the staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies of patients with diabetes. Applicants should provide a detailed description of the materials or equipment to be provided. How the drug or product will be sent to each participating center, as well as packaging, storing and accountability issues must be presented. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS: A selection committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations. It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the selection committee through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria:
1.	The statement should provide specific details about the product to be supplied, particularly any validation of its use in a pediatric population, and in obese subjects, if relevant.
2.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the product in a timely manner for the duration of the study.
3.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator. 

DATES: Only written Clinical Trial capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before August 11, 2003 will be considered. Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited, at the Collaborator’s expense, to discuss their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Steering Committee, date and place to be determined. The Institute may issue an additional notice of Clinical Trial opportunity. This notice is directed toward companies with resources to support collaborations.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND QUESTIONS: Capability statements should be submitted to Rochelle Blaustein, J.D., Director, Technology Transfer and Development, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 12 South Drive, MSC 5632, Bethesda, MD  20892-5632, rochelleb@intra.niddk.nih.gov, Fax:  301-402-7461.

The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials and performing  all labor required to complete the replacement of the fan coil units,  heating/cooling water system, windows, and roof in Facilities 10834, 10835, and  10836.  The scope will also include associated architectural, mechanical,  plumbing, electrical, and miscellaneous work as shown on the project drawings  and described in the specifications.  The estimated price range is  between $1M and $5M.  The NAICS Code is 238220.  The size standard is $12M.   This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement in accordance with the Small Business  Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15  U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in the  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations issued  after 31 May 1998.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov, or  telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423.  Every solicitation issued after 31 May 1998 must  include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, "Required Central Contractor  Registration.: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: This project involves  the Visitor Quarters (VQ), which houses military and  civilian personnel of all levels, including VIPs on  Temporary Duty at WPAFB for numerous official Air Force  activities.  This project is in an extremely high  visibility area, due to the number of visiting individuals  housed at any one time, and will receive an unusually high  level of scrutiny.  This project will be subject to a very  tight construction schedule.  The project is in phases, and  involves work in each room.  This work will require close  coordination between disciplines, and close supervision by  the contractor in order to minimize the number of  unavailable rooms at any one time.  The work must be  accomplished so that the remaining occupied units will not  be impacted, nor the personnel housed in them  inconvenienced.  The requirement to supervise and  coordinate the work in all of the rooms contained in the  VQ will present the contractor with a difficult  construction management challenge.  Failure to supervise  and coordinate the different trades required to provide a  quality and timely product will not be acceptable.   Performance is critical to minimize disruption to WPAFB  activities.  The liquidated damages associated with not  meeting the contractual period of performance will be high  due to the cost of housing Air Force personnel off base if  the rooms are not available on schedule. NOTES: (1) The solicitation, specifications, and drawings will be available on the  website on or about 14 July 03, at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. (2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you may  download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation. (4) A hard copy of the solicitation will be available for review at Dayton  Builders Exchange, Minority Contractor Business Assistance Program, and F.W.  Dodge Division in Dayton, OH.

Howeverm when you register you will receive notice of any  amendments and/or addendums that may be issued to the solicitation.  If you  have not registered, it will be your responsibility to check the website for  any changes to the solicitation.

However, contractors shall only be responsible for  providing bonding for the base amount plus the amount of any/all options  exercised at the time of award.

<DESC>CORRECTION TO THE RESPONSE DATE: THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE 12 AUGUST 2003. THIS SOLICITATION IS ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS, INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The project includes site demolition, earthwork, storm drainage piping, minor concrete work and incidental related work. The project involves working around active runways, taxiways, and aircraft parking aprons, which necessitates coordination of work schedules with the Airfield Operations Officer and Contracting Officer, and maintaining radio contact with the control tower at all times to ensure that contractor’s workforce does not interfere with the operation of aircraft. The total estimated value of this acquisition is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The construction requires completion in approximately 129 days. No work will be allowed between 28 October 2003 and 5 November 2003. Proposals will be evaluated using source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the “best value” to the Government, price and technical factors considered. Technical Factors include Past Performance, Experience, Technical Qualifications, and Management Approach.  The Government reserves the right to: reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government. PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVUALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms.

A pre-proposal conference will be scheduled approximately two weeks after issuance of the RFP, and proposals will be due around 12 August 2003. The exact dates and completion schedule will be stipulated in the RFP. Offerors must register themselves on the Internet at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.

The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, quality control, safety prevention, tools, materials, equipment, and transportation necessary to provide grounds and tree maintenance services and other incidental work.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is replacing the Standard Industry Code Classification (SIC).  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 56173 (previously SIC Code 0782) and the annual size standard is $5 Million.  The contract is a combination firm fixed-price/indefinite quantity contract.  Parts of the contract requirements will be full performance-based service contracting, where the Contractor shall have full responsibility to perform the services using their own and industry best practices and processes to ensure that specified outcomes are achieved.  The contract term will be a base period of one year plus four option years.  The total term of the contract, including all options, will not exceed 60 months.  If the Government does not award a follow-on contract in time, the Government may require the Contractor to continue performance for an additional period up to six months under the Option to Extend Services clause.  In either case, the Government will not synopsize the options when exercised. This contract will replace a contract for similar services awarded in 2000 for $2,609,711.00 (firm fixed-price) and $42,126.00 (indefinite quantity) per year.  We will include information about the current contract and the incumbent contractor (e.g., value of last option exercised, firm name, address, etc.) with the solicitation package.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Environmental Services which was posted on April 4, 2003.  You are notified that the following changes are made:  The RESPONSE to QUESTION 80 is revised as follows: Proposing cost saving innovations should not be a competitive disadvantage if the rationale is supportable and there is sound logic to justify proposing less labor hours, materials, or any other resources required to meet the statement of work requirements under which the innovation is taking place.  Probable cost adjustments will only be made when an Offeror's proposed method of meeting the statement of work requirements does not coincide with the amount of resources proposed to meet the requirements. The due date for responses is not extended.  The due date remains July 3, 2003, at 2pm. Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

In addition, add the following:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement has been determined to be a sole source procurement, based on the authority at FAR 6.302-1 (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source, which exempts this procurement from full and open competition.  CONTRACT LINE ITEM (CLIN) – CLIN 0001 – 50 IPRS Ports with ATM/Access Service for Internet.  The DELIVERABLES: To provide a secure, dedicated access for USUSH’ end-users to dial into the LAN using a fast-packet circuit (ATM OC3) as a WAN.  PACKING and SHIPPING: N/A.  WARRANTY: A standard commercial warranty shall be provided for the software. The Contractor shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government. Acceptance of the standard commercial warranty does not waive the Government's rights under the Inspection clause nor does it limit the Government's rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract.  FAR CLAUSES AND PROVISIONS: The provision of FAR 52-212-1, Instruction to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.  All offerors are required to submit a completed copy of Addenda to FAR Clause 52.212-1 1) Item (b) Submission of Offers is amended to include the following: Submit your proposal, with acknowledgment of amendments (if any), software licensing agreements (if any), descriptive literature and specifications for the proposed equipment, and the FAR 52.212-3 – Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items, prior to an award.  Telegraphic or facsimile offers are not acceptable.  Period for acceptance of offers is amended to include the following:  The offeror agrees to hold the prices in their offer firm for 90 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers.  EVALUATION FACTORS - The following evaluation criteria are included in paragraph (a) of that provision.  The contractor must be able to meet the following technical criteria which will be evaluated to determine successful offeror:  The acceptable contractor (1) must be able to provide a secure, dedicated access for USUHS end-users to dial into the LAN using a fast-packet circuit (ATM OC3) as a WAN; (2) must be able to provide a private connection between corporate customers while securing customer databases from unwanted intrusion; (3) must provide 24/7 maintenance and support for the network management; (4) must be able to assign 50 access ports in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area that allows users access to one of the secured ports and travel through the network using existing ATM AC3; (5) must supply connectivity to network access server; (6) must provide additional IPRS ports for any additional users; (7) must be able to provide remote users the ability to connect to corporate headquarters using a dialup access (analog or ISDN) with Washington, D.C. area users using a dedicated local/long distance toll-free number assigned to USUHS.  Addendum to FAR clause 52.212-2. Evaluation Factors for award:  Any resulting order will be issued to the company offering the best value to the Government.   Factors that will be considered are technical capability and price. Technical capabilities are significantly more important than price. Failure to provide the information relative to each evaluation factor may render offer non-responsive. 1) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY: Evaluation of technical capability and ability to meet the evaluation factors will be based on product literature, technical features and/or warranty provisions.  Each offeror is required to submit licensing, descriptive literature, or other documentation, to show how the offered product or service meets or exceeds the requirements as specified in the specifications.  2) PRICE: Price shall be based on ports and circuits, local and FCC tariff rates for services, warranty and any discount terms.  Evaluation is based on best value including cost and ability to meet stated requirements above. Offerors shall submit descriptive literature detailing features, technical capabilities and warranty data. Technical acceptability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this provision as it compares to the minimum characteristics provided above. Therefore, it is essential that offerors provide sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government’s evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as to meeting technical acceptability.  The full text of these clauses may be accessed electronically at this address:  http://www.arnet.gov/far/.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Optical Components.  NASA LaRC has a requirement for an extensive opto-mechanical rapid prototyping set.	The set of optical, electrical and photonic components needs to be extensive and modular.	Attachment 1 is a complete description of the requirement. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Responses must include the following:	name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).	 All inquiries should be directed to both Terri D. Williams and Lionel E. Nadeau. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Terri D. Williams no later than July 8, 2003. Please reference 1-209-RFJ.1536 in any response.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>17.   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is seeking a contractor to conduct the NRC's Package Performance Study (PPS) research program.  The PPS is a study of the response of spent nuclear fuel transportation casks to extreme accident conditions.  The principal activities under a resultant contract will be the preparation of a detailed program plan and the implementation of the plan following NRC approval.  The plan tasks will include analyses and prediction of the physical response of a rail cask and a truck cask for full-scale impact and thermal testing under extreme accident conditions.  Any potential contractor would be expected to have in-house capabilities to conduct the requisite finite element analyses and access to a test site on which impact and fire test facilities could be constructed if the contractor does not currently have them.  (In NUREG-1768, entitled, "United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission Package Performance Study Test Protocols" which was published as a draft for comment, the NRC staff proposed a 75 mph impact for both full-scale casks and a fully engulfing hydrocarbon-fuel fire for more than 30 minutes.  The impact test would likely be from a tower about 300 ft tall.  NUREG-1768 is available on the NRC website - www.nrc.gov.)

The contractor chosen to perform this work must demonstrate expertise and experience in the development and implementation of large scale tests - experience specifically working with spent nuclear fuel transportation casks is a strength.  The program will require a nuclear grade QA plan.  Please provide a few pertinent examples when responding to this sources sought request.  

The level of effort estimated for this work is 24 staff-years over a period of five years.

Potential Conflicts of Interest: The respondents are requested to identify any current or planned contracts or projects dealing with the NRC regulated nuclear power industry and/or Department of Energy (DOE), in general, the Yucca Mountain Repository project, and DOE's prime contractor, Bechtel SAIC, in particular.

Potential sources shall provide a letter of interest, a capability statement, and resumes showing capability to perform the work.  Respondents shall send this information to Deborah Neff, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.  The closing date for responses is 30 calendar days from the issuance of this notice.  This synopsis is not a request for proposal.  A Request for Proposal will be issued to those firms deemed capable.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Reference “Remote LAN Trace Tool” when responding to this announcement. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is attempting to identify vendors that are capable of providing a software application for remote LAN tracing that does not require its own hardware. The Agency is seeking sources that produce a software package and/or solution that will meet the following requirements: 1) remote packet captures: The product must be able to remotely gather network layer data [layers 1, 2, and 3 of the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model] for real-time analysis and be able to transport that data to a central site to be saved for future analysis, 2) unattended format: The tool must be able to operate in an environment devoid of user intervention. That means that an engineer or user at HQ or another site must be able to initiate a capture remotely, without anyone at the user site providing assistance, 3) No third party initiation tool [Microsoft System Management Server (SMS), remote control, etc.]: Once the tool is installed, no 3rd tool may be required to initiate the trace or download (e.g.… NT scheduler may not be used to initiate a trace). SMS or a 3rd party tool MAY be used for initial install. Initiation, use of the tool must not require a remote take over/ remote control of the target machine. We want the ability to interact with the software remotely without having to use another piece of software to control the tracing. Also we want to be able to use a third tool like SMS to install it remotely so that we do not have to install it on each of the 100,000+ workstations in the network one by one manually, 4) Integrated conversion tool (.enc format): The tool must be capable of saving the trace files into required formats on its own. No 3rd party tool may be required for saving data in the formats specified elsewhere within this document. The minimum required format is NAI .ENC format, 5) the product must be capable of the full 7 layer OSI model decode. Product must decode, at a minimum, the following networking protocols; TCP/IP – all IP protocol – icmp, tcp, udp, etc, http, SNA, DLC, 6) Generated reports must be capable of saving in several common formats – Microsoft Word .doc format, text file format, RTF, HTML, .PDF, 7)  Pre and Post filtering (Mac address, IP address, protocol, sender, designation), 8) Product must allow user to specify search criteria before capture is initiated that will narrow down the search results (and decrease the file size) (pattern matching), 9) Product must also allow user to specify criteria that will narrow the search results AFTER the capture is completed and transferred to the user, 10)  Frame slicing – product must be able to capture only the specified portion of a frame, 11) Product licensing: Product must be licensed on an enterprise basis. This means that pricing may not be incremental based on number of machines under the product umbrella, 12) View the real time status of the decode and trace (bytes, frames, buffer, etc.), 13) Provide trace analysis: Product must provide an expert analysis of the trace upon receipt of the completed trace. This should present itself in both executive type reports as well as data level decodes of the trace data. Expert suggestions about root cause analysis should be available as well, 14) Merge traces: Product must be able to merge two or more separate trace files together into one for analysis, 15) No preset limit on trace file size, 16) Runs on all Unix and Windows platforms: This includes but is not limited to, specifically, Windows 2000, XP, NT, and Solaris, 17) Licensing sharing: Product licensing must have the capability to be centrally managed, 18) Security: Must integrate with Windows security, 19) the product must be delivered in CDROM format, 20) provide documentation both in printed format and on CDROM, 21) provide both email and telephone support during normal business hours, with additional non-prime time options available, and 22) Compliancy with Section 508. Interested vendors must be able to provide verifiable proof by submitting information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the Agency’s requirement. Vendors responding should indicate whether their services are available on the GSA Federal Supply Schedules or any other Government Wide Agency Contract (GWAC). This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the data received. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA’s assessment of capable sources. Responses to this notice should be submitted electronically by August 20, 2003. No Faxed responses. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME. ELECTRONIC RESPONSES ONLY, to the POC identified above.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Notice of Intent for Microsoft Agency Standards
<DESC>In June 1996 the Social Security Administration (SSA) competitively awarded a contract to Unisys Corporation for the hardware and software required to support SSA's new intelligent workstation and LAN environment. Through the Unisys contract SSA acquired 108,922 licenses for Microsoft Windows Operating System software and 102,354 licenses for Microsoft's Office Professional suite of desktop software as well as the associated Server software and Client Access Licenses. As a result of this competitive procurement, Microsoft Windows Operating System, Microsoft Office Professional Suite products and Microsoft server software became the Agency's “de facto” standard. This notice is to advise industry of SSA’s intent to now officially declare that Microsoft’s Windows Desktop Operating System, Office Professional Suite, companion server software products (i.e., Exchange Server, System Management Server, Windows Server, SQL Server and Host Integration Server), Project and Visio will be established as SSA desktop and LAN software standards. The establishment of the aforesaid software products as agency standards is justified on both a business and technical basis. The business case is predicated on the fact that SSA intends to protect its $127 million financial investment in these Microsoft products that have been competitively acquired. SSA’s investment is a result of it’s acquisition costs (i.e., software license and support costs total $76.4 million), employee training (i.e., general training costs to provide all employees with a basic knowledge of Word, Excel and Outlook are estimated to be $33.6 million and specialized training costs to approximately 1,200 Site LAN Coordinators are estimated to be $4.4 million) and software deployment costs (i.e., SSA has spent approximately $12.6 million over the 7-year contract life to have new releases, revisions and fixes downloaded to servers supporting the workstation and LAN environment). It should be noted that the aforesaid business case does not include the costs associated with SSA’s application software dependence on the Microsoft operating software and office suite programs. SSA has written custom application systems that invoke and interoperate with MS Office suite software and many more that will only run on Microsoft operating systems. These two categories of applications would have to be re-developed and in some cases re-designed and re-developed at costs that would likely equal or exceed SSA’s investment in training.
The technical case is predicated upon the need for SSA to optimize the administration and efficiency of its intelligent workstation and LAN environment. The ability of SSA to continue to economically deploy, maintain and provide user support for the Microsoft products is predicated on using a standard configuration wherever possible. This standard configuration is Microsoft’s Windows technology, for the operating system, and Office Professional Suite at a common release level. This permits the mass distribution of a desktop software image with minimal manpower for individual customization. Similarly, it expedites system recovery and software troubleshooting. Microsoft’s Office Professional Suite is comprised of the following major components: Word, Excel, Access, Powerpoint and Outlook. There is a significant sharing of technology and features among these products and the Windows operating system that makes it desirable to use these products in conjunction with each other. SSA has considerable experience with Microsoft’s Office Professional Suite, having 102,354 copies deployed for over five years. The training and hands-on experience over the past five years, the document compatibility needed by current users, and documents created over the past five years make the continued use of Microsoft’s Office Suite the most efficient and effective technical solution. Although certain other products claim to be compatible, each have significant deficiencies (e.g., lack of an integrated Web browser, e-mail client, and group scheduling or serious compatibility problems with Microsoft Office products).  Using any other product eliminates or greatly restricts access to all of the existing Microsoft Office legacy files. Certain companion Microsoft products maintain similar benefits from their interoperability and compatibility with the operating system and Office Professional Suite.  Currently, Microsoft’s server based products (i.e., Exchange, System Management, Windows, SQL and Host Integration) are considered necessary companion products to the desktop suite and share this interoperability, as do the desktop and server versions of Project and Visio software. All of these Microsoft products enjoy this advantage and have met all known SSA requirements for planning and technical drawings. The use of the Microsoft Project and Visio products, wherever feasible, permits interaction with the Office Professional Suite and the sharing of information among SSA users. This document does not constitute a solicitation for offers. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Pricing data is not requested or required. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be assessed before a final determination is made. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any Government evaluation of submitted information. Any responses to this notice should be submitted electronically within 10 calendar days to Cynthia.Spencer@ssa.gov and refer to SSA Microsoft Software Standard.

INTRODUCTION:  The NIDDK is developing a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open label clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of a treatment regimen including cyclosporine A and ACEI therapy to a regimen including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), oral pulse steroids, and ACEI therapy in inducing remission of proteinuria in patients with steroid resistant FSGS. Patients included in the study will cover an age range of 2 – 35 years. Additional objectives are to compare the persistence of remissions following termination of the primary therapy, rates of extrarenal complications, and change in the level of renal function between the two treatment regimens.  Five hundred study participants, recruited by approximately December 2005 local participating sites in the United States and Canada associated with five Core Coordinating Centers, will be randomized for the trial.  Each Core Coordinating Center is expected to randomize 100 study participants during a 26-month accrual period.  Patients will then be followed for at least 18 months after randomization.  Central data collection and analysis will occur at the NIDDK funded Data Coordinating Center at the Cleveland Clinic.

STUDY GOAL:  The overall goal of this study is to determine whether either of the two immunosuppressive regimens has a better effect on any of the following: induction of a remission, sustaining of remission, fewer or better tolerated side effects, maintenance of glomerular filtration rate.  The ACEI medication will be used as a background, standard of care part of both arms of this open label trial. For patients who are unable to tolerate treatment with ACEi, an ARB will be substituted.  

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  Therapeutic interventions for the treatment of FSGS have been widely reported. However, evidence based treatment guidelines have not been developed because of the lack of controlled studies and the small number of patients included in most reports. While most studies are purportedly undertaken for the purpose of safety, the effect of therapeutic agents on proteinuria is reported and conclusions concerning efficacy are drawn despite insufficient numbers of patients enrolled in these studies to provide statistically valid outcomes. Over the past decade, a number of studies have reported therapeutic efficacy for treatment with Cyclosporine-A (CSA) in patients with nephrotic syndrome including patients with steroid resistant FSGS. There have been two controlled trials of treatment with CSA in steroid resistant FSGS, one in children and one in adult patients. Consequently, CSA is the only medication that has been documented to be efficacious in a controlled trial in both children and adults with steroid resistant FSGS. The experience with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in the treatment of patients with steroid resistant FSGS has been limited to uncontrolled trials in adult patients and children. Although these studies are uncontrolled and consist of small numbers of patients, the combination of MMF with oral pulses of corticosteroids resulted in a significant decline in proteinuria in patients with FSGS. This will be the controlled trial comparing these two agents. The duration of the trial will be five years. The Collaborator providing the ACEi and ARB will be expected to provide free active drug for the duration of the study for approximately 500 enrolled participants. The drugs should have already been studied in children with data submitted to the FDA. The Collaborator may have access to unblinded data at the completion of the trial at the same time as the participating investigators. The NIDDK Project Scientist will obtain any IND’s required for the trial.  The Collaborator will provide NIDDK staff with information and data necessary to meet the FDA IND requirements.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” to help in their deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  The Capability Statement may not exceed 10 pages and should address the following criteria: Details on FDA drug approval status; Time line for ability to provide drug after selection of Collaborator is determined; Approved daily dose of drug; Previous studies of efficacy of drug in treating proteinuria; Known side-effects of drug; Known interactions with other drugs; Ability to provide a liquid preparation with proven bioavailability equivalent to the tablet formulation, and a shelf life of at least one month.

SUBMISSION DATES:  A written statement of interest must be submitted by 1 August 2003 and all Collaborator Capability Statements must be submitted by 1 September 2003.

<SUBJECT>A -- UTILIZATION OF ORAL DEXAMETHASONE IN THE FOCAL SEGMENTAL GLOMERULOSCLEROSIS CLINICAL TRIAL
<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases seeks oral dexamethasone to be used in one arm of an open label multicenter clinical trial designed to compare the efficacy of two immunotherapeutic regimens for Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis: Cyclosporine A (CSA) and Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) with oral pulse corticosteroids.

INTRODUCTION:  The NIDDK is developing a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open label clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of a treatment regimen including cyclosporine A and ACEI therapy to a regimen including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), oral dexamethasone, and ACEI therapy in inducing remission of proteinuria in patients with steroid resistant FSGS. Patients included in the study will cover an age range of 2 – 35 years. Additional objectives are to compare the persistence of remissions following termination of the primary therapy, rates of extrarenal complications, and change in the level of renal function between the two treatment regimens.

The ACEI medication will be used as a background, standard of care part of both arms of this open label trial. For patients who are unable to tolerate treatment with ACEi, an ARB will be substituted.  

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  Therapeutic interventions for the treatment of FSGS have been widely reported. However, evidence based treatment guidelines have not been developed because of the lack of controlled studies and the small number of patients included in most reports. While most studies are purportedly undertaken for the purpose of safety, the effect of therapeutic agents on proteinuria is reported and conclusions concerning efficacy are drawn despite insufficient numbers of patients enrolled in these studies to provide statistically valid outcomes. Over the past decade, a number of studies have reported therapeutic efficacy for treatment with Cyclosporine-A (CSA) in patients with nephrotic syndrome including patients with steroid resistant FSGS. There have been two controlled trials of treatment with CSA in steroid resistant FSGS, one in children and one in adult patients. Consequently, CSA is the only medication that has been documented to be efficacious in a controlled trial in both children and adults with steroid resistant FSGS. The use of aggressive high dose intravenous steroids in the treatment of patients with steroid resistant FSGS has been strongly advocated but is controversial. Therapeutic regimens, which have included pulse corticosteroid therapy, cyclophosphamide and alternate day steroids, have been impressive in uncontrolled series with small numbers of patients. However, high dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy has been associated (although not in FSGS patients) with complications including infection, decreased bone density and demineralization, induction of diabetes mellitus and poor statural growth in children, in addition to the cost and inconvenience of intravenous therapy. Nonetheless, there is a clear consensus among the Participating Sites and the Steering Committee of the FSGS Clinical Trial that the efficacy of pulse corticosteroid therapy should be evaluated in patients with steroid resistant FSGS. Preliminary data suggests that high dose oral dexamethasone may be efficacious in patients with steroid resistant FSGS. The dose of dexamethasone that was chosen for this study is extrapolated from the dose used in a preliminary study and provides approximately 33% of the total steroid dose in the most intense intravenous therapeutic intervention. The dosage of dexamethasone will be 0.9 mg/kg per dose, with a maximum dose of 40 mg, given as a single dose on two consecutive days at the start of weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46 and 50 for a total of 46 doses. It was felt that this dose could be therapeutic, especially in combination with another agent. The experience with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in the treatment of patients with steroid resistant FSGS has been limited to uncontrolled trials in adult patients and children. Although these studies are uncontrolled and consist of small numbers of patients, the combination of MMF with oral pulses of corticosteroids resulted in a significant decline in proteinuria in patients with FSGS. This will be the first controlled trial comparing these two agents. The duration of the trial will be five years. The Collaborator providing the dexamethasone will be expected to provide free active drug for the duration of the study for approximately 250 enrolled participants. The Collaborator may have access to unblinded data at the completion of the trial at the same time as the participating investigators. The NIDDK Project Scientist will obtain any IND’s required for the trial.  The Collaborator will provide NIDDK staff with information and data necessary to meet the FDA IND requirements.

<SUBJECT>A -- LARGE FLATTENED MODE FIBER FOR FIBER LASERS
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY LICENSEE TO PRODUCE LARGE FLATTENED MODE FIBER FOR FIBER LASERS


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to build Large Flattened Mode (LFM) Fiber.

Researchers at LLNL have developed a Large Flattened Mode (LFM) Fiber, which is particularly suited for use in fiber lasers.  The invention permits the construction of higher power fiber lasers which retain good beam quality compared to lasers using traditional fiber.  The fiber uses both refractive index profile engineering and gain profile engineering to create a fiber structure that only allows a preferred flat-topped mode to lase. 

For applications requiring high beam quality radiation from efficient, compact and rugged sources, diffraction limited fiber lasers are ideal, and to date have been demonstrated at average power levels exceeding 500 W.  For conventional single-core step-index single-mode fibers, this power level represents the scaling limit because of nonlinear and laser damage considerations.  Higher average powers would exceed nonlinear process thresholds or else damage the fiber due to the high intensity level in the fiber’s core.  Simply expanding the core dimensions of the fiber allows a straightforward power scaling.  However, the enhanced power handling capability that results comes at the expense of beam quality, because of multiple transverse modes which lase simultaneously.  

Although this problem of multimode operation can be mitigated to some extent by appropriately designing the fiber’s waveguide structure, limitations such as bend radius loss, sensitivity to thermally induced perturbations of the waveguide structure, and refractive index control, all become more stringent as the core diameter grows, limiting the extent to which the core diameter can be grown and still ensure single mode operation from the fiber.  Our invention addresses some of these limitations and enables a new approach to single transverse mode operation of large mode area (LMA) fibers.  This provides a route to high average powers possibly exceeding 1 kW from a single aperture in a Strehl-ratio-optimizing flat-topped output beam.  

LLNL would like to find a manufacturer of fiber or lasers who has an interest in licensing and commercializing this technology.  




Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Large Flattened Mode (LFM) Fiber should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO000026-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Large Flattened Mode (LFM) Fiber technology.

<SUBJECT>--The U.S Army Corps Of Engineers, New York District has a need for brand name only equipment for a fire alarm control panel and integrated radio transceiver.
<DESC>NA Market Survey:  The New York District intends to solicit and award a construction project for the United States Military Academy (USMA), West Point, N.Y.  entitled Ã¢Â€Âœ Thomas Jefferson Hall Ã¢Â€Â (Library and Learning Center).  The project itself will be solicited com petitively under a future solicitation.  However, the project includes A Brand Name Only component.  This notification serves three purposes:  (1) to  notify potential offerors of the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to solicit a brand name only component under a future  construction project and (2) to identify potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and (3) notification of the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to contract sole source for a Brand Name Only, system Monaco, as described below.  The Monoco system is emb edded in the Construction project, which project will be issued competitively.  Only that part of the project requiring Monoco system is sole source if no sources are able to provide a compatible system. In the event no compatible equipment exists, the Bra nd Name Only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source.   The synopsis is for planning purposes and is not a solicitation.  This synopsis is the only document that will be published notifying potential offerors of the go vernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s intent.   SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT:  The project includes Brand Name only equipment for a fire alarm control panel and integrated radio transceiver manufactured by Monaco Enterprises.     This project with its many state-of-the-art building components requires a reliable receiving and reporting building fire alarm system. It has been determined that a microprocessor based radio controlled fire reporting system is the best and the most econo mical alternative to be compatible with the existing hard wired system.  The USMA currently uses the Monaco D-700 Enhanced Central Radio Alarm System.  Monaco Enterprises Inc. M-2 Fire Alarm Control Panel (due to compatibility with D-700 Enhanced) is the e quipment best suited to meet the needs of USMA.

<DESC>General Instructions, Conditions, and Notice to Offerors

The Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) Office of Maritime and Land Security is soliciting innovative concepts for use in port security preparedness, response, and evaluation enhancement.

This acquisition will use a multi-step process to award resultant contract(s) that represent the best value to the government in accordance with the established evaluation criteria.

This announcement constitutes a Request for Proposals (RFP).  No additional information regarding this announcement will be issued.  This announcement will remain open until 5:00 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, July 29, 2003.  The government intends to conduct an evaluation of proposals based upon the criteria set forth herein.

The TSA reserves the right to select and fund all, some, or none of the proposals received under this announcement.  The TSA provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Proposals (or any other material) submitted will not be returned.  Facsimile and electronic submittals will not be accepted.  It is the policy of the TSA to treat all proposals as source selection sensitive or proprietary information, and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.

Foreign entities are not eligible to submit proposals in response to this announcement. 

The TSA is seeking participants for this program that are capable of demonstrating the capabilities required to achieve the objectives described in this announcement.  Offerors have the opportunity to be creative in the selection of the technical and management processes that best suit their approach.

Anticipated Award Information is as follows:

Total Amount of Funding Available:  Up to $20M
Timing of Award(s):  4th Qtr.of FY03
Anticipated Number of Awards:  Multiple (based upon evaluations and funding availability)
Anticipated Award Type:  Awards will take the form of contracts

Evaluation Process

Personnel from the United States Coast Guard, Maritime Administration under the U. S. Department of Transportation, and the TSA will serve as members of the evaluation board that will be formed.  These individuals will evaluate the proposals with preference given to those who best meet the evaluation criteria.  Based upon this evaluation, the TSA will determine which proposals will be selected for contract award.  Detailed technical and cost proposals will be subsequently sought from those offerors whose technical responses have been identified as being of “particular value” to the TSA.  However, any such encouragement does not ensure a subsequent award.  The TSA intends to enter into discussions/negotiations with each “selected” firm in an effort to award a contract.

Upon completion of the evaluation, the TSA will notify offerors if their responses will not be further considered for award.

Description of Objectives

The products proposed under this announcement should be applicable to seaports (including inland and/or Great Lakes) in their entirety (infrastructure and multiple transportation modes) and should pertain to one or more components of port security (awareness, preparedness, prevention, response, and/or post incident restoration of services).  The products should be scalable to include multiple ports.  Capital investment purchases will be considered.  The TSA intends to purchase the technology or tools to conduct and/or evaluate exercises and training in multiple ports on an on-going basis or to fund scalable intermodal security exercises and training.

Some examples of such products include (but are not limited to):  1)  computer-based simulation software for training and exercises;  2)  databases(s) to enable the TSA or others to monitor and evaluate port security through training and exercises;  3)  web-based training and exercise systems;  4)  specific exercises or simulations to train and exercise the security spectrum impacting transportation in port areas, etc.

In general, preference will be given to products that:

·  are scalable from single ports to multiple ports
·  impact multiple port systems instead of a single terminal or   facility
·  enhance intermodal transportation security within port areas, including pipelines
·  are complementary to existing port security systems
·  enhance preparedness or improve consequence management capabilities for a terrorism incident in ports
·  enhance port-level command, control, coordination, and communication (C4)
·  enhance awareness to the transportation community of port security threats and vulnerabilities
·  improve information/intelligence sharing among stakeholders, or 
·  support one or more existing security contingency plans within the port or assist port stakeholders develop new plans

For developmental products, the executable (source) code shall be made available to the government-designated agency for evaluation purposes.

The following types of projects are considered ineligible for award consideration:

·  projects involving funding requirements for routine maintenance and operating expenses of existing systems
·  projects involving security infrastructure improvements
·  projects that do not provide a compelling security benefit
·  projects that involve new software development beyond modest software adaptation or integration

Proposal Submission

No award can be made without a formal, written proposal which states how to perform a specific effort within an estimated cost and performance period.  Industry, small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, educational institutions, historically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions are encouraged to participate.

Proposals should be submitted to the following address and individual by 5:00 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, July 29, 2003:

Offerors must be able to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance in order to meet the security requirements of the work proposed, and key personnel must be able to obtain the appropriate security clearance.

Proposals shall consist of two separately bound volumes as follows:

Volume 1:

Volume 1 should consist of a 10 page concept paper and up to a 30 page detailed statement of work (SOW) and shall include the following sections each starting on a new page.

a.  A cover page, including proposal title, technical and administrative points of contact along with the telephone and facsimile numbers and e-mail address, followed by a letter signed by the authorized officer specifying the proposal validity period (at least 120 days).

b.  An overview of the proposed technologies and/or products as well as any innovative claims for the proposed product, and how they will contribute to port security preparedness, response, and evaluation enhancement.

c.  A summary of the deliverables.

d.  A summary of the schedule and milestone that can be traced to the work breakdown structure (WBS).

e.  SOW:  A SOW clearly detailing the scope and objectives of the effort and the technical approach.  It is anticipated that the proposed SOW will be incorporated as an attachment to the resultant award.  To this end, such proposals must include a severable SOW without any proprietary restrictions, including a detailed listing of the technical tasks/sub-tasks segregated by year.

f.  If any portion of the project is predicated upon the use of government-owned resources of any type, the offeror shall clearly identify the resources required; the date the resources are required; the duration of the requirement; the source from which the resource may be acquired, if known; and the impact on the project if the resource is not provided.

g.  Technical arguments that substantiate claims made in the overview (Proposal Section B) and a description of a technical approach consistent with the deliverables and schedule (Proposal Sections C and D).  Technical arguments should also address any major risk areas.

h.  A description of the results, products, and transferable technology expected from any possible resultant award.

i.  A brief discussion of past performance detailing previous accomplishments and work in the same or similar project areas, and previous cost and schedule performance within the last five years   include names, titles, organizations and phone numbers of references to contact regarding these projects.

j.  A brief discussion of the overall approach to the management of this effort, including brief discussions of total organization; use of personnel and their qualifications; project, function, and subcontractor relationships; technology transition plans; government project interfaces; and planning, scheduling, and control practices.

k.  Discuss how your past performance validates expected future performance.  Key factors in evaluating the value of past performance includes:  1) experience of the company in supporting a major federal client;  2) demonstrated successful experience with the required processes and systems;  3)  knowledge of the procedures applicable to the required effort; and  4)  experience of the company and its key personnel in managing a federal work effort.  

l.  The offeror’s past performance should be relevant to the major functional areas identified in the statement of work and be of comparable size, scope, and complexity to this requirement.  The government will consider the currency and relevance of the information submitted, the source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror’s performance.  

m.  Offerors shall submit five past performance references.  Each reference shall include the following information:  contract number and type; award and final values; contractor’s name, address, and point of contact; phone and fax numbers; e-mail address; and a short description of the scope of the contract.  
   
Volume II: 

Volume II shall include the WBS, a cost summary, and a breakdown of individual cost elements of the effort, including material costs, labor hours cost, overheads, other direct cost (travel, etc.), and fee/profit.  This data will be used in assessing the realism of the estimated proposed costs.

Note:  If a proposal is selected for further consideration, a detailed cost proposal will be requested based upon an agreed-to SOW.

Evaluation Criteria

These criteria are listed in descending order of importance for evaluation purposes with technical merit being significantly more important than the other evaluation criteria.

Evaluation of proposals will be based on the following criteria:

a.  The overall merit of the proposed approach to the port security preparedness, response and evaluation enhancement effort including the innovative aspects of the proposed effort.

b.  The offeror’s capabilities, related experience, experience of the key personnel who are critical to program success, and facilities and/or techniques that are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives.

c.  The realism of estimated costs and schedules and the potential affordability impact, including total ownership costs if applicable. 

d.  The past performance of the offerors.  This evaluation will be based on the quality and applicability of the offeror’s history in relationship to these work requirements, and how the offeror’s past performance validates expected performance and customer service to the TSA.  

In conducting the past performance evaluation, the government may use data obtained from other sources, as well as that provided in the proposals.  The evaluation will examine the offeror’s actual performance on similar efforts.  This evaluation will focus on the size, scope, and complexity of past work efforts; the performance measures and service levels applied; and the actual results achieved when measured against these established service levels.

The lack of a relevant past performance record may result in an unknown performance risk for the government, but will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.  A past performance risk assessment will be conducted based upon the information provided in the offeror’s proposal and information acquired through other sources identified by federal members of the source evaluation team.

Administrative Requirements

·  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The NAICS code for this announcement is 561210 (facilities support services).

·  Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Successful offerors not already registered in the CCR will be required to register prior to award of any resultant contract.

Protests

As a condition of submitting an offer or response under this announcement, the offeror or potential offeror agrees to be bound by the following provision relating to protests.

Protests concerning the TSA’s Request for Proposals (RFPs), announcements, or award of contracts shall be resolved through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) dispute resolution system at the Office of Dispute Resolution for Acquisition (ODRA) and shall be governed by the procedures set forth in 14 C.F.R. Parts 14 and 17, which are hereby incorporated by reference.  Judicial review, where available, will be in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46110 and shall apply only to final agency decisions.  A protestor may seek review of a final decision only after its administrative remedies have been exhausted.

a.  Offerors initially should attempt to resolve any issues concerning potential protests with the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer should make reasonable efforts to answer questions promptly and completely; and, where possible, to resolve concerns or controversies.  The protest time limitations, however, will not be extended by attempts to resolve a potential protest with the Contracting Officer.

b.  The filing of a protest with the ODRA may be accomplished by mail, overnight delivery, hand delivery, or by facsimile. A protest is considered to be filed on the date it is received by the ODRA.

c.  Only an interested party may file a protest.  An interested party is one whose direct economic interest has been or would be affected by the award or failure to award a TSA contract.  Proposed subcontractors are not "interested parties" within this definition.

d.  A written protest must be filed with the ODRA within the times set forth below or the protest shall be dismissed as untimely.

(1)  Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation that are apparent prior to the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to the time set for the receipt of initial proposals.

(2)  In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties that do not exist in the initial solicitation or announcement, but which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation or announcement, must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals following the incorporation.

(3)  For protests other than those related to alleged solicitation or announcement improprieties, the protest must be filed on the latter of the following two dates: (i) no later than seven (7) business days after the date the protester knew or should have known of the grounds for the protest; or (ii) if the protester has requested a post-award debriefing from the TSA Evaluation Board, not later than five (5) business days after the date on which the Board holds that debriefing.

f.  Protests shall be filed at:
Office of Dispute Resolution for Acquisition (AGC-70) 
Federal Aviation Administration 
800 Independence Avenue SW, Room 323 
Washington, DC  20591

Phone:  202-267-3290
Fax:  202-267-3720

g.  At the same time as filing the protest with the ODRA, the protester shall serve a copy of the protest on the Contracting Officer and any other official designated in the solicitation or announcement for receipt of protests by means reasonably calculated to be received by the Contracting Officer on the same day as it is to be received by the ODRA. The protest shall include a signed statement from the protester certifying to the ODRA the manner of service, date, and time when a copy of the protest was served to the Contracting Officer and other designated official(s).

Additional information and guidance about the ODRA dispute resolution process for protests can be found on the ODRA Website at http://www.faa.gov.
