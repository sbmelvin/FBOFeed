<DESC>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</span>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an operating administration within the U.S. Department of Transportation whose mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and to reduce traffic-related deaths and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. NHTSA accomplishes its mission by:<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span><span style="FONT: 7pt "><br />-&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Researching and demonstrating promising strategies to influence positive traffic safety behaviors;<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span><span style="FONT: 7pt ">-&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Planning and executing strategic communications campaigns to support program activity;<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">- Providing grants to State and local governments to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs; and<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>- &bull;</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Setting and enforcing national safety performance standards for motor vehicles and equipment.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Disciplined Communications Approach</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">NHTSA's communications strategy uses a disciplined approach to develop and implement its communications programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA communications activities are rooted in policy which provides the foundation for its messaging. Once policy has been established, program offices develop program initiatives and countermeasures to tackle the issues facing the various facets of traffic safety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, communications activities based in research and using sound, effective messaging support NHTSA's policy and program efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">This disciplined approach includes reviewing traffic data, conducting and evaluating market research data, developing TV, radio, and digital creative materials, placing and negotiating advertising, conducting media relations, developing collateral materials, and developing partnerships.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">While highly visible enforcement activity continues to be the anchor for the national communications program, other integrated communications activity must continue throughout the year to keep the message fresh and in front of the American public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Consistent and continual reminders of the horrific human and economic costs of motor vehicle crashes must be developed. Effective communication must be maintained not only with the target audience, but policymakers must also be made aware of the potential lifesaving actions that can be taken to alleviate these problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Research demonstrates that preventing impaired and distracted driving and increasing belt use will have the most significant impact on meeting NHTSA's mission with traffic safety campaigns for all of the American driving public including the Hispanic population.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">NHTSA's priority programs are designed to prevent impaired driving (including motorcycle riding), increase seat belt use, and decrease distracted driving.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other NHTSA campaigns include promoting child passenger safety; drowsy driving, heatstroke, speed, teen driver safety, pedestrian safety, bicycles, school buses, and older drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Drunk driving is one of the most often committed crimes in America. Drunk driving deaths accounted for 29 percent of all traffic fatalities annually in 2015. Affecting 1 in 3 Americans annually, drunk driving resulted in 1 fatality every 51 minutes and 28 deaths every day in 2015. Over 10,000 people lost their lives in 2015 in crashes involving drivers with blood alcohol content (BAC) of .08 and above.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Seat belt use has proven to be a lifesaving countermeasure. Seat belt use can reduce fatalities by up to 45 percent for front seat passenger car occupants and 60 percent for front seat light truck occupants.<
