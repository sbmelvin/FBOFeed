<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a cost reimbursement, sole-source award, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to "Centro de Investigaciones Cientificas y Educacion Superior de Ensenada (CICESE)", located in Ensenada, Mexico, to install five moorings along two transects at latitudes 25°N and 23.5°N across the continental slope in western Mexico to conduct current measurements over the full water column for one (1) year.  The total period of performance of this effort shall be thirty-six (36) months.  The estimated cost of this effort is between $1,700,000 and $1,731,000.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received within thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has limited the study of physical processes in the GOM to American waters. With rapid increase of deepwater oil and gas development in recent years, the information of physical processes occurring in Mexican waters is needed for proper impact assessments of OCS activities.  For a US company/organization to conduct the work of acquiring the information in Mexican waters, permission is needed from the Mexican government. The permit process will take a minimum of 8 months, and 4 man-months of labor costs, under the most optimistic conditions, and runs the risk of being disallowed by the Mexican government.  The delay or not having the permit will jeopardize other MMS funded studies in American deep waters designed to be conducted concurrently with this study.  The cost to the government of this delay is estimated at over one million dollars to make up the information gap at the later phase.  Accordingly, the MMS intends to solicit and negotiate a sole-source contract with a Mexican education institution deemed to have the appropriate staff, experience, and capability to conduct the work.  As a Mexican Institution, CICESE will be able to facilitate the permitting process. Also, CICESE has extensive experience in physical oceanography both within the Gulf of Mexico and other areas, they have carried out similar work in the Mediterranean Sea, the Yucatan Channel, and the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Mexico, their publication record of scientific peer-reviewed papers is excellent, and they are leaders in Gulf of Mexico oceanography in Mexican territorial waters.  POINT OF CONTACT:  In order to respond to this notice, interested parties shall reference RFP No. 32916 by writing or E-mailing to Michael W. Hargrove, Contracting Officer, Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., MS 2510, Herndon, VA 20170-4817 (michael.hargrove@mms.gov).  Offerors are strongly encouraged to use written questions, E-mail, or facsimile (703-787-1041) inquires.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, GovWorks (DOI/GovWorks) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to the University of Maryland, School of Medicine under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services/Office of Minority Health (DHHS/OMH). DOI/GovWorks intends to issue a sole source Purchase Order under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  The value of this acquisition is below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.  This is a simplified acquisition using FAR Part 13.  The purpose of the project is to further support the development of a special journal issue as a communication strategy for the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health and to meet the Office of Minority Health's DHHS mandated responsibilities for supporting mechanisms that address racial and ethnic disparities in health care in multiple categories, i.e., prevention, research, service delivery, treatment, training, education, and the dissemination of information to reduce the incidence of illness among minority populations.  The Sole Source determination is based upon the contractor's experience and expertise in working on the following projects:  In 2000, the OMH co-sponsored a conference in conjunction with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Commonwealth Fund, and the Sergi Zlinkoff Fund for Medical Education titled "Diversity and Communication in Health Care: Addressing Race/Ethnicity, Language, and Social Class in Health Care Disparities".  On March 10-11, 2003 the National Managed Health Care Congress (NMHCC) launched an inaugural forum titled "Reducing Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care: What Actions Now?"  The conference addressed and summarized the extant knowledge regarding the role of race, ethnicity language, and social class in provider/patient communication.   The forum focused on what health professionals and consumers could do nationally, regionally, and locally to ensure that racial and ethnic minorities receive the same access to quality health care as non-minorities.   It also focused on translating recommendations from the Institute of Medicine report "Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care" into specific, measurable strategies and action steps.  The University of Maryland, School of Medicine is the only source who is able to prepare the special journal issue because of its previous involvement in planning the conference and forum.  The university is already familiar with the topics and issues discussed and can produce the desired deliverables within the time frame needed for this requirement.  This is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all information received within fifteen (15) days of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action is based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. POC: Department of the Interior; Attention: Anna Brown, 381 Elden Street-MS2510, Herndon, VA 20170. All questions should be emailed to anna.brown@mms.gov and MUST reference FBO number 33121.

<DESC>NASA/HQ plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the following commercial items (brand name or equal): Quantity 19: 30" Sony model KVL-30XBR900 televisions. Since these televisions are a crucial component to providing safety information to headquarters staff as part of the Emergency Preparedness Plan, it has been determined that the use of a brand name or equal purchase description is advantageous under these circumstances.	In addition to the brand name, the following includes a general description of various physical, functional, and performance characteristics of the brand name item that an "equal" item must meet to be acceptable for award.  The proposed television must meet the following specifications:  Screen size: 30" LCD panel (measured diagonally); Widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio; minimum 1280 X 768 pixels resolution; Progressive display (all pixels display at once); Size: Maximum of 38-1/4"W x 20-11/16:H X 3-13/16"D; Maximum weight no greater than 44Lbs.  The brand name was chosen because it these HD-Ready sets have a less visible scan-line, the widest viewing angle, both horizontally and vertically, and has an auto-volume leveler feature that adjusts the sound above the ambient noise level which could be quite high in an emergency situation. Additionally, the television must have a ability to protect the screen from burns that occur when a continuous image runs.	 The anticipated release date of the RFQ 4200038126HBE is 12/30/03 with an anticipated quote due date of on or about 1/2/04. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities page is  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=04		     Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>UNITED STATES TREASURY DEPARTMENT
GOVERNMENT DEBT ISSUANCE AND MANAGEMENT ADVISORS 
EMERGING MARKETS – WORLDWIDE 

The U.S. Treasury Department provides technical assistance and policy advice to senior government and central bank officials and market participants in nearly 30 countries. We are recruiting candidates for positions as resident (long-term) and intermittent (short term) advisors in government debt issuance and management in countries throughout the world, including Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Southeast and Central Asia, Latin America, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. This recruitment is for global assignments and significant international travel is required.

For resident (long-term) assignments, we seek experts in domestic government securities issuance and management. Experience in international bond markets is highly desirable. Applicants for resident assignments ideally should have a combination of public and private sector experience in government debt management, investment banking or financial advisory work. For intermittent (short term) assignments, we are seeking advisors with particular expertise in: liability management policy and procedures; legal framework for government securities; market regulation; custody, clearing and settlement; fixed income trading; treasury operations; and mortgage and other asset-backed finance. For all positions, management experience is desired. Prior overseas work experience in challenging environments is a distinct advantage. Foreign language skills are highly desirable. While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of host government officials and provide sound but realistic advice to a sovereign government in an emerging market environment will determine ultimate success.   Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.

SALARY AND BENEFITS: Salaries are negotiated in accordance with program regulations, based on demonstrated salary history and the skills required. The salary range is from $85,000 to $134,000, subject to January 1, 2004, cost of living adjustments (COLA).  Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations.  Successful applicants will be subject to a background investigation at the appropriate level.   This announcement is open and continuous until June 30, 2004, although selections may be made in advance of that date.   Applicants should submit a cover letter, resume or OF-612 by e-mail to: tgray@ota.treas.gov or by mail to:  U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Technical Assistance, ATTN: Recruitment Coordinator, 740 15th Street, N. W. – 4th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20220.  Please reference Solicitation Number A04-009 on your cover letter, resume or OF-612.  Only applicants to be interviewed will be contacted.  NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  If you wish to be considered for this announcement and all future announcements for the Government Debt Issuance and Management Program, you must state so in the cover letter to your application. For application materials, visit our web site at: www.ustreasury.hu and www.eps.gov  (search by solicitation number A04-009).

Task 2 - Review the cost estimate basis for the plan. Task 3 - Assess whether the issues have been categorized as to the risk to overall health and safety of the workers and/or risk to the continued operation of the ATR. Task 4 - Assess the NE-DC and NE-ID oversight effectiveness of ATR operations. The team should review DOE headquarters and field oversight of the ATR for purposes of determining effectiveness of the oversight and safety assessment approval processes and outcomes. The scope of the review should include oversight process adequacy, oversight process implementation success, and issues identification and relationship of the NE field personnel to the contractor. The task deliverable will be a report sub-divided into three areas - any immediate threat to the health and safety of the worker or continued operation of the reactor, mandatory items that needed to resolved in the next two years and discretionary issues.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy intends to conduct an acquisition by means other than full and open competition.  The anticipated sole source acquisition is to Paul D. Rice, Augusta, GA.  The contract will be fixed price and is estimated at approximately $54,570 for a period of two months.  Mr. Rice will assist DOE in the review of the INEELs? management and operations contractor plans for the continued safe operation of the Advanced Test Reactor at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.  A summary technical description and overview of the INEEL and the ATR may be found at http://www.inel.gov/facilities/tra.shtml. The work will require a specific assessment in the following areas: Task 1 - Assess the NE-ID management and operations contractor developed plan, determine if the plan is technically sound, and has properly considered short and long-term risks in the planning assumptions and analyses. Task 2 - Review the cost estimate basis for the plan. Task 3 - Assess whether the issues have been categorized as to the risk to overall health and safety of the workers and/or risk to the continued operation of the ATR. Task 4 - Assess the NE-DC and NE-ID oversight effectiveness of ATR operations. The team should review DOE headquarters and field oversight of the ATR for purposes of determining effectiveness of the oversight and safety assessment approval processes and outcomes. The scope of the review should include oversight process adequacy, oversight process implementation success, and issues identification and relationship of the NE field personnel to the contractor. The task deliverable will be a report sub-divided into three areas - any immediate threat to the health and safety of the worker or continued operation of the reactor, mandatory items that needed to resolved in the next two years and discretionary issues. Mr. Rice has the required experience and capability in managing projects and organizations that include commercial nuclear power construction projects, upgrade and restart of U.S. Department of Energy production reactors, project and corporate engineering organizations, and naval nuclear regulatory field offices.  Mr. Rice?s work will ensure that ATR maintains its essential scientific and engineering capacity in the research and development area of safe and effective reactor operations.  Mr. Rice will ensure that the cost estimate is fair and reasonable and that planning assumptions and short-term and long-term risks are adequate and are properly reflected.  Mr. Rice will also ensure that short-term and long-term risks have been properly categorized, that issues have been identified adequately, and that mandatory items that need to be resolved have been identified.  As the Vice President and General Manager of the Reactor Restart Division, Westinghouse Savannah River Company, his experience included operations, engineering, maintenance, nuclear safety, start-up testing, quality assurance and environmental safety for the DOE production reactors.  His responsibilities include successfully restarting the K-Production Reactor following a four-year shutdown, which included plant design upgrades, safety program development and implementation, and personnel selection and training. The exception to competition is 10 US.C 2304(c)(3) ? Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services. This is not a notice of availability of a solicitation ? there is no RFP available. Only sources believing they have the requisite capability may respond with a capability statement.  Any statements received will be reviewed only to determine if the basis for a sole source procurement no longer exists and the acquisition should then proceed on a competitive basis.  Responses must be received no later than January 5, 2004.  Point of contact is T. Wade Hillebrant, Contracting Officer.

Supporting information justifying the allocations shall be maintained and used to explain FOHS’s cost allocation methods to Department of Health and Human Services officials and independent auditors. 2) Evaluating the relationships between federal accounting standards and methods which FOH is required to use, and the financial information and controls necessitated by FOHS’s 100 percent reimbursable activities.  Based on this analysis, the contractor shall recommend enhancements to FOH’s financial management systems, identify area for simplification and efficiencies, and assist the Director of FOH in making proposals to FOH’s oversight organizations or responding to their proposals or request for information.  As a result of this work the Contractor shall produce the following deliverables: 1) written algorithms for allocation of FOH IT costs; 2)written explanations for changes from algorithms already in use; 3) oral briefings on methodology and the meaning of supporting data; and 4) written recommendations to FOH financial management practices and oral briefings on the recommendations. These services must be provided by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) who thoroughly understands the financial management and accounting environment, systems, and methods under which FOH operates, and who also understands the organizations, services delivery techniques, and program support systems that FOH utilizes.  This proposed requirement for which the Government intends to solicit only one source is under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the services required.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE; therefore, requests for such document will be considered invalid responses.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with the award to Lloyd Flagg.

<DESC>The U.S. Marine Corps is issuing this Pre-Solicitation Notice for a Mobility Denial System (MDS) that will assist Marine units, and possibly law enforcement elements, in controlling mobs during unruly protests and violent confrontations.  The systems will dispense a Government-developed and furnished aqueous solution that makes surfaces so slippery that belligerents will be reluctant to enter the treated area or find it extremely difficult to function within that area.  Two dispensing systems are being sought:  a “vehicle-transportable” system, that can be operated from the back of a High-Mobility, Multi-purpose, Wheeled Vehicle (Hum-Vee), and a “man-portable” system that can be carried and employed by a single individual.  The Army and the Marine Corps are planning to procure approximately 100 vehicle-transportable and approximately 700 man-portable systems.  

On 13 January 2004, the Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, VA, will host a Pre-Solicitation Conference to entertain questions, encourage industry participation and solicit input on the Government’s draft System Specifications.  The conference will be held at BAE Systems, 25 Center Street, Stafford, VA 22554.  An MDS website has been established at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/ctq.opport.asp.  The agenda, pre-registration form, map to the conference site, and drafts of the two Systems Performance Specifications can all be found at the above website.  All parties interested in attending are encouraged to pre-register.  Interested parties should routinely check the web site mentioned herein for updates.  

This announcement is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire MDS systems. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement, or otherwise pay for information requested.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of  this announcement .   NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.

<DESC>Technical Point of Contact: Dr. Diana Loree 505-846-5261. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy (DE) Contracting Division on behalf of the AFRL Directed Energy Technology Directorate (DEHA), Kirtland AFB NM, intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1 to Communications & Power Industries (CPI) Microwave Power Products Division for Multi-Megawatt W-Band Source Development, based on technology developed and demonstrated by CPI under a previous contract.  The contemplated contract is a four-year effort with an approximate value of $ 6,000,000, and an option with a two year performance period valued at approximately $3,000,000.
 The Government requires a 2 to 2.5 Megawatt, high efficiency, continuous wave (CW) 95 gigahertz microwave source to fulfill objectives of an Air Force program with Airborne potential.  Given this CW output level is larger than any known test facility, it is understood that testing will be done to the limitations of the contractor’s facility.  The contractor shall design, build, test, and deliver a source system.  Source system is defined as a source tube with auxiliary components (arc detector with electronics and full power dummy load) and superconducting magnet subsystem (magnet, compressor, and magnet power supplies).  The contractor shall perform extensive modeling, simulation, experiments, and testing at the maximum capabilities of their facilities (which will be no less than 1MW peak RF output) to ascertain the final CW capabilities of the source.  The contractor shall also specify requirements for the government’s test stand, which will serve as a full power facility in the future.  As an option, the contractor shall design, build, test and deliver an additional source system, consisting of a source tube and a superconducting magnet subsystem.

 As a minimum, the source shall meet the following specifications:  
The source shall provide a minimum continuous wave (CW) output power of at least 2 MW (minimum) with a 2.5MW (goal), in the TEM00 mode, at a frequency near (but not to go below) 95 GHz, measured just outside the output window. The efficiency of conversion of electrical power to microwave power for the source, at full output power, shall not be less than 55 percent (minimum) with 65 percent as a goal for the CLIN 0001 source tube.  The efficiency of conversion of electrical power to microwave power for the source, at full output power, shall not be less than 60 percent (minimum) with 65 percent as a goal for the CLIN 0003 source if that option is exercised.  The superconducting magnet subsystem shall not require externally supplied liquid cryogens.

The source system shall be designed to support the following performance requirements (basic and option):

Transportation Conditions (non-operational):  This source system shall include shipping crates/packaging.  It must be able to be shipped disassembled via standard commercial shipping in ambient conditions ranging from 0 degrees F to 125 degrees F.  Technical input shall be provided so the source system shall be transportable via standard commercial trucking means, while mounted in the government’s future mobile test stand system.
Operational Conditions and Mediums:  The source system shall be designed to be able to operate at altitudes of up to 20,000 feet above sea level.  The external insulating medium for high voltage hold off considerations shall be compatible with all operational altitude, operational temperature, and insulating mediums specifications aboard aircraft, and must meet government approval.  In addition, the cooling medium for the source shall take into consideration minimizing overall system weight and meeting operational and ambient condition specifications.
Ambient Temperature Conditions:  The source system shall meet all operational specifications under ambient temperature conditions of –25 deg F to +140 deg F, with the exception of the compressor and the power supplies for the superconducting magnet, which will be allowed to have a 41 deg F to +100 deg F ambient temperature operating range and a maximum inlet coolant temperature of 82 deg F.
Source System Weight (basic and option):  The source system shall weigh no more than 3500 lbs (without cooling fluid) (weight goal = 2500 lbs).
Input Power Frequency (basic and option):  60 Hz
Mounting Position (basic and option):  Accommodate any position, vertical or horizontal, during transport and accommodate vertical (cathode down) with tilt angles of 45 degrees in any plane while operational.
Operating Time (basic and option):  The source shall be designed to operate for 1000 hours without major maintenance, defined as requiring the source to be returned to the factory for repair and/or refurbishment.
Variability (basic and option):  The source subsystem shall be designed to enable adjustments in source output power from 10% to 100% of full rated capacity.


A contract will be issued CPI provided other sources cannot perform in an equal or better technical capacity. Respondents are required to provide a statement of capability containing pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas: 1. Experience: An outline of projects previously performed relevant to the subject areas. 2. Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientific, engineering and program management personnel who might be assigned to work in the areas of subject effort. 3. Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration. Responses are limited to 25 pages including program plan, resumes, attachments, etc. Any responses not addressing all requirements will be rejected. Submit responses to Susan Thorpe, AFRL/PKDP, 2251 Maxwell Ave. SE, Kirtland AFB, NM, 87117-5773 by 3:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time (MST) no later than 07 January 2004. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received within forty-five (45) calendar days after the publication date of this announcement. The determination of the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This is an unrestricted announcement under NAICS code 541710.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Office of the Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the existing Natural Gas utility system located at McConnell Air Force Base (ARB), Kansas.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, a firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system.  The successful firm will be required to purchase the existing system from the Government and may be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the Government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate, the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The Contractor proposal and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past Performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP.  No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.

Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation:  McConnell Air Force Base (AFB)
Location: Wichita, Kansas
Installation Description:  McConnell Air Force Base (AFB) is located southeast of Wichita, KS.  McConnell AFB occupies 2853 acres and contains approximately 653 buildings.  The west side is mostly devoted to the Kansas Air National Guard.
Utility system to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

a.	Natural Gas:
      
      McConnell AFB:

Natural Gas is supplied through an 18” high-pressure line (320 psig) and enters a metering station.  This metering and regulating station serves the entire base at 50 psig. Williams Natural Gas owns the 18 inch supply line, metering station, and regulator; McConnell AFB owns the 4” steel line from the odorizer onward.   The distribution system consists of approximately 160,349 linear feet of underground piping and associated valves, meters and regulators.  Most of the piping is les than 10 years old.  Approximately 99 percent of the system piping is polyethylene; the remaining 1 percent is wrapped carbon steel.  





         Kansas Air National Guard Base:

Kansas Air National Guard Base’s supply of natural gas is through K,G,&E by way of two lines.  The majority of natural gas supplied to Kansas Air National Guard Base is supplied from a 4” steel line at 20 psig that enters the base at a metering and regulating station.  This metering and regulating station serves 95% of the Guard Base at 10 psig.  Natural gas enters at a second point to the west of building 80 through a 3” polyethylene line and serves only Building 65 at 10 psig.  K,G,&E owns the regulators and meters at the two metering stations.  Kansas Air National Guard owns the piping after the meters.  The Kansas Air National Guard portion of the Air Force owned distribution system consists of approximately 14, 021 linear feet of underground piping and associated valves, meters and regulators.  The piping ranges in age from 20 years to 23 years.  Approximately 37 percent of the system piping is polyethylene and the remaining 63 percent is wrapped carbon steel.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Presolicitation Notice - Unrestricted Solicitation (with up to two 8(a) competitive set-asides) for up to five (5) World-wide (United States, Europe, Korea and for World-Wide Contingency Operations) Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Qua ntity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) Ã¢Â€Â“ for Design-Build Construction, Construction, Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection, and Remediation of real property, to include (but not limited to) planning, designing and constructing new and/or  renovated medical facilities for Air Force real property medical inventory.  Typical projects include the replacement, restoration or modernization of hospitals, clinics, administration buildings, ambulatory health facilities, warehouses, veterinary clini cs and wellness centers.  Air Force restoration and modernization projects typically include the planning, design and installation/construction of the following systems:  HVAC, medical gas, plumbing, electrical, elevators, building envelope, fire protectio n or total renovation.  North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220 (Commercial and Institutional Building Construction), which corresponds to SIC 1542.  The Small Business Size Standard is $28.5 Millio n.  It is the intent of the Fort Worth District to issue one solicitation for award of up to five contracts (three (3) Unrestricted and two (2) 8(a) Competitive), creating two separate multiple award contractor pools.  The total contract capacity is estima ted not to exceed $200 Million over a five-year contract period ($170 Million for Unrestricted and $30 Million of 8(a)).  To preclude the need to re-solicit, if two contracts cannot be awarded to 8(a) firms, the total capacity of $200 Million will be distr ibuted by one, or a combination of two methods:  1) equally distributed to the three successful Unrestricted contractors, or 2) make an additional competitive award to a fourth unrestricted contractor.  The estimated duration for each contract award will b e an initial Base Period of twelve (12) months with up to four (4) Option Periods of twelve (12) months each, for a total not to exceed contract period of sixty (60) months.  Each contract will remain active:  1) unless the contractor has a documented past  performance record of unsatisfactory; 2) until contract expiration; 3) until task order completion; 4) until the total contract capacity limit is reached, or 5) the contract is Terminated for Convenience of the Government.  It is anticipated that any rema ining capacity from awarded contracts with documented unsatisfactory performance may be distributed amongst the remaining contractors with a record of satisfactory performance.  For estimating purposes only, each of the three Unrestricted ContractorÃ¢Â€Â™s  estimated maximum per one-year contract period is $11.3 Million, and the 8(a) Competitive Contractor estimated maximum per one-year contract period is $3 Million.  However, each Unrestricted Contractor has the opportunity to receive award amounts up to th e estimated Unrestricted total contract capacity of $170 Million.  Likewise, each 8(a) competitive contract has the opportunity to receive awards up to the estimated 8(a) total contract capacity of $30 Million.  The minimum guarantee for each Unrestricted contract will be $200,000 (if a total of three contracts are awarded).  The minimum guarantee for each 8(a) contract will be $30,000.  If a fourth Unrestricted contract is awarded as a result of not awarding any 8(a) contracts, the minimum guarantee for th e Unrestricted contracts will decrease to $175,000.  The minimum guarantee amount will be applicable to the base period only.  Funds above the minimum guarantee will be obligated with the issuance of task orders.  .  The minimum order limitation for both t he Unrestricted and Competitive 8(a) contracts will be $2,500.  The maximum order limitation for the Unrestricted and Competitive 8(a) contracts will be $30 Mil lion and $10 Million respectively.  After award of the base contracts, Unrestricted contractors will not compete with the 8(a) contractors for award of individual task orders.  In determining which contractor pool to solicit for a given task order requirem ent, consideration may be given to 1) the complexity of the work; 2) past performance of the contractor; 3) contract task order limitation; 4) on-going work, 5) bonding capacity, and any other task order specific requirement.  The Government reserves the r ight to exceed the stated maximum order limitation.  The solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about January 12, 2004, under solicitation number W9126G-04-R-0002, once the Acquisition Plan has been approved.  Proposals are anticipated to be due on  or about February 11, 2004 (30 days from issuance of the solicitation).  The solicitation will be a negotiated acquisition.  All contracts will be awarded based upon the Ã¢Â€ÂœBest ValueÃ¢Â€Â to the Government.  Procurement consideration will be given to  technical capability (including specialized experience, past performance, organization and management, key personnel, safety record, quality control, and schedule capability), price and other salient factors included in the solicitation.  Proposals from L arge businesses must comply with FAR Clause 52.219-9, regarding the requirement for a Subcontracting Plan.  The Fort Worth District goals (expressed as a percentage of the contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s total planned subcontract amount) are as follows:  Small Business 57.2%; Small Disadvantaged Business 10%; Women-Owned Small Business 10%; HUBZone Small Business 3%, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business 3%.

<DESC>Salient Characteristics for Network Traffic Generator Requirement
Attachment 1


Physical Specifications:  The NTG may be single or multiple chassis to support a separate or combined pitch-catch capability. The NTG total package must be no greater than 4RU and must be a 19-inch rack mountable system.  The NTG must be capable of operating at both 115-230 Volts 50/60 Hertz power.  The NTG at a minimum must be capable of supporting at least eight (8)-10/100/1000 Base T interfaces with RJ-45 connection.  Network Services and Protocols:  The NTG must be able to generate IP, TCP, and UDP traffic over multiple ports.  The NTG must be able to support streaming servers that use any of the three major streaming formats: Apple QuickTime, Real System streaming, and/or Microsoft MMS streaming version 8 or 9.  Network Architecture Simulation:  The NTG must be capable of generating and receiving traffic from any possible IP subnet to include private IP space (such as the 10.0.0.0 network).  The NTG must create a software configurable virtual router capability for class A, B or C networks.  The virtual router device or network under test must provide next hop router, which the device or network under test can forward traffic.  For example, if the device under test has an interface address of 172.16.1.2/24, the NTG must be capable of providing a next hop router, such as 172.16.1.1/24, which may be configured as a default gateway on the device under test.  Traffic shall be forwarded to the device under test such that it appears to be forwarded by a router on the local network of the device under test.  The NTG must be capable of generating traffic using multiple (three or more) IP subnets on a single port.  The NTG must be capable of utilizing non-contiguous subnets, and subnets of varying sizes on a single port.  This capability will allow the trainer to emulate a wide array of subnets and services thus providing the appearance of a very large network.  Realistic Network Traffic: The NTG must be capable creating highly reliable stateful application layer (layer 4-7) traffic simulating client(s) and server(s) traffic located anywhere and used together or separately as training needs dictate.  The NTG must be capable of creating, maintaining, and terminating application layer client server sessions that are TCP compliant with properly generated sequence numbers, slow start/congestion avoidance, round trip time calculation, network latency, packet loss, TCP timeout, packet retransmission, packet fragmentation and re-assembly.  The NTG must be capable of supporting PCAP reply of TCP and UDP traffic flow simulating higher-level traffic like NFS, SQL, RPC SMB, and DMS.  The NTG must be capable of generating traffic, which can flow through network address translation devices with no loss in performance and/or functionality.  All protocols supported by the NTG, including PCAP replay, must be capable of being passed through a NAT device.  The NTG shall provide to emulate network clients, servers and services to include the ability to that other references within the network to the clients, servers or services can be correctly established and maintained, for example: virtual clients and servers have corresponding entries in the DHCP database.  The NTG must provide a up to 10,000 plus stateful client server application layer sessions and hundreds of thousands of transactions/second at least 80% of wire speed (100 MB).  Supports a minimum of 500 servers per port.  The NTG must support generation of stateful traffic on all supported protocols/services simultaneously.  The NTG must support defining traffic on generated random IP and MAC addresses and provide for defining traffic on static IP and MAC addresses.  The NTG must be capable of supporting any mix protocols/services per port with application compatibility to third party devices such as application layer gateways/firewalls and email forwarding systems.  The NTG must be capable of creating complete stateful HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3, DNS, and Telnet sessions/connections and interact with third party systems, such as servers, firewalls, email gateways, virus scanners, spam filters, application layer gateways, etc.  The NTG should be capable of simulating a large number of users (greater than 1000) simultaneously creating, sending, receiving and deleting email messages.  The NTG must be capable of supporting multiple protocols on a single port utilizing the same or separate random IP addresses.  For example, HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443, Telnet on port 23, etc.  The NTG must generate protocol/service traffic types in a random pattern.  The NTG must generate random network traffic data packet sizes.  The NTG must be ability to store data files for traffic generation (I.E. Cache Web pages, email attachments, etc) & configuration files for traffic generation without requiring external hardware.  The NTG must allow the replay a libpcap formatted capture file with fully stateful TCP as well as TCP realism features of: packet loss, congestion avoidance and link speeds.  The NTG must be capable of playing back the application layer data within the libpcap formatted file over new TCP connections with varying IP addresses with proper TCP sequence numbers and checksums.  The NTG’s SMTP must provide the ability to import users from a CSV or TXT file format and allow for configuration control over TO, FROM, SUBJECT, and message body add attachments to messages.  The NTG must provide realistic HTTP features, including the ability to emulate browser versions, user think time, user frustrations, user click-paths, random page fetches, page fetches, user forms databases, ability to send and parse XML (SOAP) messages, ability to manage dynamic session IDs, and ability to support basic and proxy authentication.  Realistic Network Attacks:  The NTG must provide the capability to simulate normal user errors that may trigger a false positive alert on network security monitoring devices, for example incorrect login.  The NTG must provide the ability for these user errors to be randomized from IP, user, protocol, error type, and subnet.  The NTG must provide the capability to simulate normal network activity that results in an alert on network security monitoring devices, for example SNMP from a mil domain to mil domain, SSH session on any port other then port 22, Telnet session on any port other than 23, the creation of an xterm session or the execution of the “SU” command.  The NTG must provide the ability for this network traffic to be randomized from IP, user, protocol, error type, and subnet.  The NTG must be capable of generating both a Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack, providing network traffic to tax the network capability to the breaking threshold.  The NTG DOS attack must not rely on other hardware to generate the attack.  The NTG at a minimum must support the known DOS attacks: Ping, Ping of Death, Land, Smurf, unreachable host, teardrop, evasive UDP, and Syn flood attacks.  The NTG at a minimum must support the known DDOS attacks: SYN Floods, ARP Floods, TCP and UDP port scans, and PING Floods.  The NTG must provide a capability for the user/trainer to develop custom/additional DOS and DDOS using a well-defined scripting language.  The NTG must be capable of generating the DDoS on the same ports that are generating multi-protocol, stateful, application compatible TCP traffic.  The NTG must be capable of generating traffic, which simulates application layer attacks over HTTP, such as Code Red and Nimda.  The NTG must be capable of passing these simulated attacks to third party HTTP servers using properly established TCP connections.  Continuous Operation:   The NTG must be capable of operating for sustained periods of time without a system reset or reboot.  Training segments vary in length from a couple of hours to 10 days.  The NTG will also be running continuously between training blocks to assist in providing status of the overall health of the simulator.  The NTG must be stable to provide for continuous operations and to not interfere with training sessions.  The NTG must be capable of operating continuously without reset for a period of a 14-day (24X7) exercise and run a continuous script which is developed to assist in determining simulator system status during periods between training events.  Traffic Generator User Interface (Trainers Capabilities) Requirements: Management Console/Remote Administration:  The NTG must provide the user/trainer a single easy-to-use management software and scripting environment supporting Perl and TCL scripting to create network traffic generation scripts, which provides full control of every single bit in the Ethernet frame for custom generated traffic.  The NTG must allow the user/trainer the ability to define/create new realistic network traffic and attacks.  The NTG must provide an easy to use interface to define traffic generation scenarios configurations by defining, combining, organizing and running scripts that generate stateful and network attack traffic.  The NTG must allow the user/trainer can control/run up to 100 scripts simultaneously.  The NTG must allow the user/trainer the ability to dynamically throttle the NTG’s user-sessions, user sessions per second, connections per second, bandwidth utilization, and protocol/service utilization, providing the ability to graduate load stressing to different levels during a single script run.  The NTG must allow the user/trainer the ability to control the protocol/service percentage/mix.  The NTG must provide the ability to control the network traffic is randomized from IP, user, protocol, error type, and subnet.  The NTG must provide the ability for the user/trainer to build upon the NTG developed virtual network to emulate actions (stateful traffic) coming from end users on the virtual network.  The NTG must automatically add any custom developed traffic generation scripts or network attack scripts to the NTG GUI for inclusion in test configurations.  The NTG must allow the user/trainer to remotely manage the NTG via a network connection, The NTG’s console interface must not place any restrictions upon device location, either geographical or network based, other than a requirement for TCP/IP connectivity to the NTG.  The NTG must allow the user/trainer the ability to control the NTG(s) independently or as a NTG cluster at the networked simulator locations from a central location and provide synchronized activities including start/stop and configuration capabilities.  The NTG must provide a management console capable of administering remote located agents [E.G. MMC type (Microsoft Management Console), Web browser interface, command line interface] providing the ability to manage multiple sites independently or clustered for synchronized activity from a single location.  Data Capture/Metrics: The NTG must be capable of providing real-time feedback to the user on infrastructure loading and performance.  The NTG test results must be able to be created and stored in native CSV (comma separated values) format for quick and ready import into any major spreadsheet, database or reporting tool.  The NTG must provide a reporting tool written in a platform independent environment such as Java that can connect directly to the NTG and retrieve test results.  This tool must be capable of providing a graphical summary of all result data provided by the NTG, allow the user to create custom graphs using any data point within the NTG results, and generate presentation-ready graphical reports in both Adobe Acrobat PDF and HTML format.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Request for Informatin P-4-PP-02004. which was posted on November 21, 2003.You are notified that the following changes are made:  To provide additional Technical information. The following is a draft set of HALE ROA performance objectives derived from a survey of approximately 30 different potential missions currently not being met or which could be performed better with an ROA.  The 30 different missions types generally fall in three categories: science, commercial and surveillance. Objective #1:  Develop & demonstrate technologies and design methodologies to enable 7 to 14 days continuous HALE ROA track and loiter operations within +/- 45° latitude, with 200 kg payload at an altitude greater than 60,000 feet by 2007. Objective #2: Develop & demonstrate technologies and design methodologies to enable 1 to 6 months autonomous HALE ROA loiter capability, within +/- 45° latitude (CONUS), with 150 kg payload at an altitude greater than 60,000 feet by 2010. Objective #3: Develop & demonstrate technologies and design methodologies to enable autonomous diurnal global range operations at altitudes up to 75,000 feet by 2012, with payloads up to 2,000kg Objective #4: Develop & demonstrate technologies and design methodologies to enable 1-3 months autonomous heavy-lift operations (up to 10,000 kg) within +/- 35° latitude, at an altitudes above 60,000 feet by 2015. Tentative plans are in work to initiate a search for an industry partner to carry-out a portion (undetermined at this time if the partner would only focus on Objective #1 or more) sometime in government fiscal year 2004.	Neither the mechanism for selecting a partner nor the type of relationship with NASA (contractual or otherwise) have been determined.  It is likely that a bidder's conference will be held prior to any solicitation. The due date for responses is not extended.	This is for additional information only. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.	The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/DFRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=CL&pin=24  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

Question- Section 3.4.1 - CQC System Manager In this section it states there must be a full time CQC manager at all times on the job.  The question or concern is regarding the job duties.  Can the CQC take on other job duties or is he/she restricted only to the duties of the CQC plan and responsibili ties? Answer- The specification is silent about whether the CQC system manager can do other duties, therefore it is left up to the Contractor to make that decision.  It is not uncommon for CQC managers to also perform other duties. Question- Is an SSPC Certified Paint Contractor Required? Answer- There is no requirement for an SSPC Certified Paint Contractor. Question- Referring to specification section 00800 paragraph 1.1, The  government will remove the fish screens, screen cleaners, and baffle  boards. On drawing LGF-1-13-12/185 it states that ALL MILD STEEL   SURFACES OF SLIDE GATES AND OPERATOR BASES AND PEDESTALS UP TO ELEVATION  633.75 SHALL BE PAINTED. the inside of the gate guides and areas of the  slide gates inside the guides are impossible to paint without removal. Is the Government going to remove the slide gates and guides to  facilitate painting, or is the remove the slide gates and guides the  responsibility of the painting contractor? Answer- The Government will not remove any components of the dewatering system other than those specified in 00800, paragraph 1.1.  If unbolting and removing parts (such as slide gates and guides) is necessary to meet the requirements for surface preparation and p ainting, the Contractor will be responsible to do so.  It also may be that some disassembly would be desirable to make the surface preparation and painting operation more efficient for the Contractor. Question- Clause 52.000-3001, Information to Bidders states that Offerors are to complete Section 00010 and 00600.  Where is Section 00600? Answer- Section 00600 is not identifiable by that designation.  The information that needs to be completed and returned includes any pages with fill-ins.  This includes pages 7-12, 16-18, 21 and 24. Question- a)  The bid date is 12-29-03, We understand that the work is scheduled  to begin on 1-10-04, we understand that the Government may notify the  contractor of the results of the options on or before 1-16-04. Under  what criteria will the bid be evaluated at the time of the bid? b)  How can the bid be excepted on any other terms other than defining the exercised  options at bid time? Answer- a)  See Clause 52.217-5.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).   b)  See Clause 52.217-7 (Included in this Amendment)

MARKET VALUE:	Ranging from $61,251 – 79,629 (Equivalent of GS-13 level).  Final compensation will be based on individual’s salary history, working experience and educational background.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
SECURITY ACCESS:		Secret
POSITION DESCRIPTION/SOW:

I. 	BACKGROUND

USAID/Tanzania (T) is a sustainable development Mission with four strategic objectives in Health/HIV/AIDS, Natural Resource Management, Democracy and Governance and Private Sector Development.  The Mission is in the last year of its current eight-year strategy and is in the process of developing a new 10-year Country Strategic Plan (CSP) that will go into effect in fiscal year 2005.  Mission management anticipates submitting the CSP for approval in Washington in April, 2004.

The Mission has identified democracy and governance as a key sector for its new strategy and has obtained approval from Washington to develop a new strategic objective as part of the new CSP.  The new SO will dovetail from the current SO: Civil society and government are more effective partners in governance.  The SO currently in effect has three intermediate results and focuses on building the capacity of key civil society organizations to advocate more effectively for key interests, and strengthening parliament.  USAID assistance in support of these intermediate results has taken a number of forms.  The DG Office has a cooperative agreement with Pact to implement a civil society capacity building activity.  The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law has a sub-grant from Pact to work with NGOs to advocate for a legal framework supportive of an independent NGO sector.  The Center for Private Enterprise, another Pact sub-grantee, works with business associations to improve their public policy advocacy skills.  The State University of New York holds a contract to implement a legislative strengthening program.  This activity is co-funded by the British Department for International Development.  

The DG Office also has received additional funds to implement a five year anti-corruption initiative.  The activity is currently being designed, but the broad parameters include designing and implementing a public expenditure tracking system at the district government level, and improving the capacity of the media to report more effectively on public financial transparency.  The DG Office also has received ESF funds for civic and voter education in Zanzibar.  The activity is currently being developed in close consultation with the Embassy and other major donors.  

In the summer of 2003, USAID/T was notified by USAID/W that it would receive additional funds for the General Education in Islamic Communities initiative.  These basic education funds have been obligated through the DG Strategic Objective Agreement and are part of the DG SO.  A separate set of results and indicators are being designed for this activity which will be implemented exclusively in Zanzibar’s two main islands.

POSITION DESCRIPTION/SOW:

I. 	BACKGROUND

USAID/Tanzania (T) is a sustainable development Mission with four strategic objectives (SOs) in Health, Environment and Natural Resources (ENR), Democracy and Governance, and Economic Growth.  The Mission is in the final phase of implementation of its Country Strategic Plan (CSP) covering the period 1997 – 2004, and is in the process of developing a new 10-year CSP for the period 2005 – 2014 (the Mission anticipates submitting the new CSP for approval in Washington by May, 2004).

The current USAID/T ENR SO Program consists of a portfolio of activities aimed at achieving the Mission’s ENR SO “Improved Conservation of Coastal and Wildlife Resources in Targeted Areas.”  The ENR SO seeks to conserve Tanzania's unique biodiversity by advancing environmental policies, legislation and improved natural resource management (NRM) practices in selected areas.  USAID/T’s approach emphasizes partnership between government and civil society that supports and informs a participatory and transparent reform process.  Four intermediate results underpin achievement of the SO: 1) Natural resource policies applied; 2) Increased effectiveness of institutions that support natural resources conservation; 3) Improved management of targeted protected areas; and 4) Community-based natural resource management regimes functioning in target areas.  The SO serves customers at three levels: 1) conservation of Tanzania's biodiversity benefits the global environment; 2) improved conservation of critical resources for a growing national economy benefits all Tanzanians; and 3) improved NRM practices benefit rural communities living in and around targeted ecosystems by providing sustainable livelihoods.  The activity portfolio of the ENR SO currently includes several large grants, one contract, and two interagency agreements.  Two of grants include public – private partnerships under USAID’s new Global Development Alliance business model.  The Mission ENR Office includes the Team Leader, two professional Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs), and one FSN Administrative Assistant.  During the current CSP, annual expenditures of the ENR SO have averaged approximately $5 million.  The ENR SO also collaborates with and co-manages several ENR activities funded out of USAID Washington offices.  The overall ENR SO is guided by a broad-based expanded SO Team that unites USAID, key Government of Tanzania (GOT) agencies, and various NGOs.  The expanded SO Team serves a central role in the management of the ENR SO portfolio.  During the current strategy period, the ENR Program has consistently performed at a high level, and served in a leadership role among donors working in the wildlife and coastal resources sectors.

The Mission has identified ENR as a key sector for the new CSP and has obtained approval from Washington to develop a new ENR SO.  The proposed new program builds on the foundation and opportunities established by the current program, increasing the attention to improving rural livelihoods, while retaining biodiversity conservation as its core goal.  The rationale for the program rests on the linkage between environment and economic growth and poverty alleviation, and the need to establish a sustainable approach to natural resource-based economic development.  The current program has set the stage for managing an appropriate balance between conservation and development, through policy and legislative reform, capacity strengthening, and pilot activities.  The proposed program will continue investment in these areas, helping Tanzania to attain and maintain that balance, while achieving significant results in areas of both biodiversity conservation and improved livelihoods.  Funding levels for the new ENR SO are expected to be in the range of $4 million per annum.  In addition, the new strategy will seek to maximize linkages between sectors, and to leverage results through integration of cross-cutting themes and tools into program approaches.  Other development sectors expected to be part of the new strategy include health, HIV/AIDS, agriculture, and democracy and governance.  Cross-cutting themes include HIV/AIDS, governance, and gender; cross-cutting tools are public-private partnerships, information and communications technology, and capacity strengthening.

Currently the NRCS in-house workforce of 127 employees within these states are performing these services.  
This A-76 cost comparison study will examine the possibility of converting Government "in-house" operations to contractor operations. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the following services and related functions performed by Government personnel to contract performance will be conducted.

<DESC>This is the second of three notices published in accordance with FAR subpart 7.303 and OMB Circular A-76 to determine the availability of private commercial sources. This notice is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The U. S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is performing a Standard Competition in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003. This A-76 cost comparison study will examine the possibility of converting Government in-house operations to contractor operations. A cost comparison to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the following services and related functions performed by Government personnel to contract performance will be conducted. Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. The competition will include the services of Soil Conservation Technician (SCT) currently performed in the states of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Approximately 278 Government personnel currently provide these services. Typical functions to be performed include conservation planning, inventory and evaluation of conservation practices, practice application, flood control assistance, urban development, inspection of conservation practices, coordination of conservation activities, and providing training. Full details of the work requirements will be in the Performance Work Statement included as part of the forthcoming solicitation. A determination has been made that the studied services are subject to the Brooks Act, and the procedure for procurement of Architect-Engineer services will be used. NRCS is requesting a procedural deviation from OMB to conduct Architect-Engineer procurement procedures with the OMB Circular A-76 public-private competition process. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990.

<SUBJECT>A -- Training Capabilities Analysis of Alternatives
<DESC>In accordance with FAR 35.007(j), US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) is issuing this exploratory Request for Information (RFI) to industry and academia to identify candidates to participate in a government - led business game in support of the Training Capabilities AoA directed by the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  This Industry Game will provide a forum to enable government representatives to further strategize with industry representatives on industry solutions to joint and service training requirements.  The game will be held, 11-13 February 2004 in the Washington, DC area, and will explore both traditional and non-traditional technical alternatives with the appropriate representation from industry.  Game participants will candidly address issues of concern from the government as well as private industry to identify where tensions and competing priorities may exist and further explore alternative solutions for an effective, successful partnering.  Industry participants will be organized into different consortia teams, which will realistically represent industry’s capabilities, priorities and investment criteria.  These consortia teams will provide the competitive platforms by which industry will be able to strategize with government representatives to match cost effective training capabilities with the Training Capabilities AoA alternatives.  Through this focused game, government participants will be able to gain greater insight into industry business priorities and risk assessments.  The results, or location of the results, of the business game will be posted on the USJFCOM website at www.jfcom.mil.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  The Program Decision Memorandum, 12 December 2002, stopped further development of the Joint Simulation System (JSIMS) after fiscal year 2003.  Additionally, it directed that an Analysis of Alternatives to determine a cost effective method to conduct joint and service training be conducted.  The AoA will be completed within 12 months after receipt of OSD guidance.  In July 2003 final guidance was received which designated USJFCOM and the Under Secretary of Defense, Personnel and Readiness, to co-chair a senior steering group made up of the offices that monitor and evaluate joint and service training performance (Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, Services, and Intelligence Agencies).  The purpose of the AoA is to determine a business case to assess whether simulation tools can resolve existing or projected training gaps and deficiencies or enhance training capabilities.  The guidance also directed consideration of a broad range of alternatives that support joint and service training to include:  1) The base case-current live, virtual, and constructive training systems; 2) Common joint tool based on the Department of Defense standard architecture; 3) Separate joint and service systems developed independently to a standard architecture; 4) Privately-funded initiatives to develop a training solution(s); 5) Use of commercially available products and gaming/simulation technology.  For each viable alternative, the AoA must provide a reasonable candidate technology, cost-benefit analysis, and training effectiveness and cost factors. 

GENERAL INFORMATION: This synopsis, which constitutes the complete RFI package, is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), but, rather, an exploratory request to determine industry and private sectors ideas and interests to solve current and future training shortfalls. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis. Any cost incurred in responding to this RFI or as a result of participation in this game will be born by the participants.  While not a requirement, respondents invited to participate are highly encouraged to attend a one-day pre-game industry meeting on or about 4 February 2004 in McLean, VA in preparation for the business game.  

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  Industry and academia interested in participating should submit a two-page white paper that identifies their organization as well as its simulation/gaming background and products.  Due to the time sensitive nature of this game; white papers should be submitted by no later than 4:00 P.M. eastern time, 8 January 2004 to philip.sargent@jfcom.mil.  Responders to this RFI must have background, experience, and understanding in the development of simulations and the supporting technologies.   The Government reserves the right to invite all, some, or none of the respondents to this RFI to participate in the business game.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items  prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. F97952.  The solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 108.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 421490.  The FDA intends to issue a purchase order for a brand name or equal for an Amersham Biosciences AKTA Purifier.  The FDA’s Instrumentation and Biophysics Branch (IBB) requires the ability to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials derived from cell lysates, tissue homogenates, recombiant protein expression systems and other sources for research efforts in food safety and counterterrorism.  The system must be able to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weight, net surface charge, and hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity.  Based on the requirement listed, the Amersham Biosciences Aktapurifier 10 with Control (13440201) is the system identified to meet the specifications. The purifier and its associated control programs provide the following features: titanium pump heads, and the entire flowpath is inert to halides, which are commonly used in biochemical chromatography.  The pump is able to mix buffers to a specified pH and conductivity, using the pl of the buffer, and compensates for temperature and conductivity.  Thus allowing for a single set of buffers to be used for experiments at different pH’s.  The UV monitor is capable of simultaneous detection at any 3 wavelengths, between 190 & 700 nm, suing a single lamp.  The lamp is automatically turned off at the end of each run, to extend its life.  The software allows automated, unattended methods development (“Scouting)”, by allowing up to 99 runs to be set up in advance, varying one or more chromatographic parameters each run.  The software also has an editable Column Library, which contains the relevant parameters for each column.  This prevents operator error in setting these parameters, extending their life, and insures the column is run at optimum parameters.  It will “watch” any sensor, and take a specified action if a threshold value is crossed.  For example, the flow can be reduced if the pressure approaches the column’s limit or the fraction collector can be turned on if a peak is detected.  The instrument can be manually controlled at all times, even during a run, without passing or ending the run.  This allows the operator to intervene should something go wrong, without sacrificing the run.  All components are completely controlled by the software, insuring run-to-run reproducibility.  All commands, whether programmed or manual, are logged, and data from all sensors is collected and saved with each run.  This allows GMP/CLP compliance, and greatly assists in troubleshooting.  Any questions should be submitted by email at dgibson@oc.fda.gov or by fax at 301/827-7177 by December 26, 2003.  The following FAR Clauses shall apply to this solicitation:  52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial: 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions- Commercial Items: and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers.  All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above.  Evaluation/award will be based on the technically acceptable quote that offers the best value to the government.  All quotes shall include the following: price; FOB point; a poc (name and telephone number); GSA contract number if applicable; delivery date (delivery date is of the utmost importance); business size; payment terms, Dun and Bradstreet number and registration into the Central Contractors Registration (CCR).
