<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Wallace O. Adcox, Contracting Officer, (703) 787-1354
<DESC>Gov.Works is issuing this request for proposals on behalf of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The project period of  performance is a base year and 4 option years. The Government estimates the  price of this effort at $750,000 to $1,000,000 PER YEAR for a total effort of  between $3,750,000 to $5,000,000. PURPOSE: The United States Agency for  International Development (USAID - www.usaid.gov) is seeking a contractor to  provide support for the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance in the  Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA/OFDA).  Inappropriate commodity collections with little use to disaster victims can  clog ports, hampering transport of needed commodity items and distribution of  lifesaving relief supplies, and hindering professional relief activities.  Therefore, DCHA/OFDA is seeking a contractor to educate the public and  targeted groups who may want to offer help for disaster victims overseas, and  to provide assistance to the USG with disaster-related donations issues, with  the overall goal of reducing the level of inappropriate commodity and service  donations.  The current USAID grantee for these activities is Volunteers in  Technical Assistance (VITA), which has established the Center for  International Disaster Information (www.cidi.org) to provide these services.  This grant is scheduled to end on December 31, 2002. The contract resulting  from this solicitation shall assume this effort January 1, 2003. The  contractor shall provide the following services in this contract: 1)  Donations Inquiry Response and Guidance:  Respond to public, corporate, and  governmental (federal, state, and local) inquiries related to unsolicited  donations of commodities or volunteer services for international disaster  relief efforts. 2) Public Education and Targeted Outreach:  Develop and  implement public education activities and material and a targeted outreach  campaign to guide the public and specific groups on appropriate donations for  international disaster victims. 3) Information Management for Appropriate  Donations:  Develop and maintain a website with appropriate donations  guidelines and other information useful in educating the public on this  issue. It is expected the contractor would have the capability to work from  an office within close proximity (range of metro services) to the Washington,  D.C. Ronald Reagan Building. Contractor employees working under this contract  requiring access to the Ronald Reagan Building should have the ability to  obtain appropriate security clearance (secret). I. DONATIONS INQUIRY RESPONSE  AND GUIDANCE. Contractor shall efficiently and knowledgeably respond to  inquiries from the public regarding unsolicited donations of commodities and  volunteer services for international disaster assistance. Volume of calls may  range from an average of 50 per day during "non-disaster" periods to 400 per  day during "high visibility international disasters" periods.  Referrals to  the contractor are from USAID Fact Sheets on the web, InterAction, other NGOs  and humanitarian agencies, or the 1-800-USAID-RELIEF staff. 1) Inquiries  regarding cash donations:  Contractor shall provide names of NGOs who are  operational and responding in the county impacted by the disaster. 2)  Inquiries regarding donations of inappropriate commodities:  Contractor shall  explain the reasons why the commodities are inappropriate and shall provide  guidance on alternative means to dispose of these collections, as directed by  OFDA. 3) Inquiries regarding appropriate commodity donations:  Once it is  determined that the proffered commodity is appropriate, Contractor shall  advise donor that (a) they must have the means to transport commodities to  the impacted country, and (b) they must have a credible recipient in-country  to receive and distribute the materials. 4) Inquiries regarding individuals  wishing to volunteer time and skills: Contractor shallexplain the problems  associated with volunteering from the perspective of aid agencies. 5) Other  related inquiries: During surge periods of ongoing high profile disasters,  contractor office hours may be extended. The contractor shall have the  capacity to respond to disaster inquires within two hours of the initial  contact. Further, the contractor may be required to provide twenty-four (24)  hour office coverage.  Also during surge periods, the OFDA CTO may require  the Contractor to establish and staff a call-center, to which USAID may  transfer calls received at its 1-800-USAID-RELIEF number. II. PUBLIC  EDUCATION AND TARGETED OUTREACH. The Contractor shall develop educational  materials and implement a general and a targeted educational campaign to  inform specific groups about appropriate donations for international disaster  victims. Targeted groups include foreign embassies and consular offices in  the U.S., federal, state, and local government officials, corporations,  Chambers of Commerce, church groups, schools, civic associations, and other  community leaders.  Specific activities include: 1) Identification of  specific groups to be targeted based on an analysis of past USG responses and  countries frequently impacted by disaster. 2) Development and maintenance of  an MS Access database of leader contacts within target groups, types of  information being requested, and frequency/amount of calls for disaster prone  regions. 3) Development of presentations, information packets, etc.  addressing issues around donations and lessons learned about inappropriate  donations. 4) Providing at least ten periodic/annual educational  presentations regarding appropriate donations to targeted groups. 5)  Establishing and maintaining contacts with the US media (including  non-English language media) in order to positively affect their coverage of  overseas disasters, which can influence the public's donations practices.  III. INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR APPROPRIATE DONATIONS. The Contractor shall  develop and maintain a website with appropriate donations guidelines and  other information useful in educating the public on this issue. CIDI's  current website is an example of the kind of information and services to be  provided -- www.cidi.org. IV. GUIDELINES FOR APPROPRIATE COMMODITY DONATIONS.  All activities under this contract shall be guided by the following USAID  positions on donations. Gifts-in-Kind (GIK) is defined below as any new or  used commodity that is donated to a relief effort by an individual, group, or  corporation. "Group" is defined as any formal or informal collection of  individuals other than a business, such as schools, churches, civic  associations, etc. Cash is Best. It is USAID's position that from an  operational, developmental, and public affairs perspective, cash donations  are highly preferred to GIK. Commodities that have been purchased with cash  donations: 1) are more cost-effective than GIK, because the cost of  international shipping alone often exceeds the cost of procuring the  commodities locally; 2) can be specifically procured on a priority-needs  basis in the exact quantity and quality required; 3) involve transportation  and handling logistics that are far less complex than the logistics  associated with GIK; 4) can be sorted, labeled (in the appropriate  languages), and packaged in exactly the manner required for storage and  distribution; 5) reach the intended beneficiaries far quicker than GIK.  Commodities that have been purchased locally with cash donations: 1) are more  likely to be culturally and environmentally appropriate, and consistent with  traditional practices and consumption patterns; 2) support the economy of the  affected region by procuring from local vendors. Conditions for Appropriate  GIK. There may be rare instances when a GIK offer would add value to aid  operations. A GIK offer shall only be considered appropriate if all of the  following conditions are met: the GIK was specifically requested from a  legitimate, field-based humanitarian organization, the GIK being offered are  not available locally, and the GIK are useable and sustainable. A) Originates  with a field request: A legitimate, operational humanitarian organization  must have requested the specific commodities being offered. 2) The requesting  organization should be operational in the affected region - they should have  staff on the ground managing humanitarian programs related to the GIK offer.  3) The requesting organization should have the demonstrated capacity to  distribute the commodities to the beneficiary population. 4) The GIK request  must be specific.  The requesting organization must also specifically approve  the GIK offer after having reviewed all relevant technical specifications. 5)  If the organization that would initially receive the commodities does not  itself meet the above criteria, they should have a verifiable partnership  with one that does. B) Not available locally:  The commodities offered should  not be available for purchase in or near the affected region or if available  locally, regional purchase should be cost-prohibitive. Based on experiences  in the humanitarian community, it is anticipated that only GIK offers that  are highly sophisticated in nature would meet this condition (eg: medical  technology). In such cases, use and sustainability issues become particularly  crucial (see below). C) Useable and sustainable:  The commodities being  offered must be useable and sustainable. The commodities should be adaptable  to local technical and environmental conditions, such as voltage, dust,  temperature, humidity, etc. When relevant, local language must be used.  Appropriate technical training must be provided when necessary for the use of  the GIK. Beneficiaries must be able to obtain supplies and parts (for  example, paper and toner cartridges for printers and copiers). Repair  services for the commodities must be made available locally. Given that any  GIK offer that meets conditions A and B above will likely be relatively  sophisticated in nature, condition C is particularly crucial. The following  types of commodities are considered by USAID to always be inappropriate as  GIK: 1) Food; 2) Bottled water; 3) Used clothing; 4) Used bedding material;  5) Fragile items likely to be damaged in shipment; 6) Medications not  consistent with WHO guidelines for medical donations; 7) Used medical  supplies and equipment that have not been sterilized; 8) Potentially  hazardous, flammable, and toxic materials (including certain cleaning  supplies); 9) Agricultural products (such as seeds, plants, and livestock);  10) Commodities meant for mass utilization that are not traditionally used or  consumed in the affected region 11) Commodities that are incompatible with  local culture and customs. Handling of Appropriate GIK. If all of the above  conditions for appropriate GIK are met, it is USAID's position that a GIK  Plan and inspection mechanism should be in place before GIK collection  begins. GIK Plan: A GIK Plan must be established before any commodities are  collected. The GIK Plan must involve the donor, the receiving organization,  and the distributing organization (if different) and must address the  following issues: 1) The confirmed need of the beneficiaries for the GIK:  Specific characteristics, quality, and quantity should be clear and verified.  2) The packaging and labeling requirements: GIK need to be packaged and  labeled in specific ways in order for shipping, customs, storage, and  distribution to proceed smoothly. 3) The shipping arrangements, including  funding: A source of funding for the shipment must be identified before  collections begin. A freight forwarder and consignee for the shipment must  also be identified in advance. 4) The humanitarian organization's local  storage and distribution plan: The organization should have resources at the  disaster site ready to receive, offload, store, and eventually distribute the  GIK to the beneficiaries. A plan for providing these services must be  incorporated into the GIK Plan. In short, the GIK Plan must encompass all  logistical and financial aspects of the donation, from point of collection to  ultimate distribution to the intended beneficiaries. Inspection Mechanism:  All commodities must be inspected prior to shipment in order to ensure that  the above conditions have been met. Additional Points on GIK. The following  additional points result from the realities and constraints described above:  1) Due to logistical, financial, cultural, and economic constraints, GIK will  not usually be requested or accepted by humanitarian organizations for  humanitarian operations. This is especially true of GIK offered by  individuals and groups, which will rarely, if ever, meet all of the above  conditions for appropriate GIK. 2) Difficulties in identifying a recipient  humanitarian organization that is operational in the affected region and/or  in establishing a GIK Plan are usually a manifestation of the underlying  inappropriateness of the GIK being offered. 3) USAID cannot be held  responsible for transport, storage, customs clearance, distribution,  monitoring, or any other aspect of GIK management. V. PERSONNEL Anticipated  key personnel include the following: Donations Coordinator / Project Manager.  The lead position for the Contractor shall serve two roles: Donations  Coordinator and Project Manager. As Donations Coordinator, this person shall:  1) Track humanitarian activities and provide links between needs in the  field, donors, and implementing agencies. 2) Link appropriate non-cash offers  with appropriate humanitarian agencies and shipping organizations. 3) Forward  to the Donations Caseworker (see below) inappropriate non-cash offers. 4)  Manage database of commodity donation offers to assist with linkages. 5)  Oversee and participate in public education, targeted outreach, and  development of educational materials on appropriate donations. 6)  Knowledgeably respond to inquiries from the public regarding donations  coordination, and other questions that are out of the scope of knowledge of  the Call Response Specialists. 7) Train other staff recruited for service  during inquiry surge periods. As Project Manager, this person shall: 1) Be  responsible for the oversight, administration, supervision, and management of  all aspects of contract performance. 2) Respond to the CTO as needed. 3)  Oversee the process of monitoring and evaluating contract implementation. The  Donations Coordinator / Project Manager must possess a thorough understanding  of the international humanitarian community, including bilateral and  multilateral donors, the nonprofit community, and the corporate sector. Call  Response Specialist(s). Call Response Specialists shall knowledgeably respond  to inquiries from the public regarding donations issues, forward inquiries as  appropriate to the Donations Coordinator or Donations Caseworker, and enter  caller information into a caller database. One or two call response  specialists are anticipated, with an ability to increase during call volume  surges. Donations Caseworker. The Donations Caseworker shall attempt to  re-channel caller generosity away from commodity donations into more  productive activities. This person shall work with private groups (schools,  churches, civic associations, etc) that, for one reason or another, shall not  feel satisfied by making an unrestricted cash donation to a humanitarian  organization. The objective of this person shall be to help such groups  identify new or existing activities that will satisfy their desire to help  but do not involve commodity donations. In particular, this person shall: 1)  Provide guidance on creative yet appropriate ways to support humanitarian  organizations, including monetization of previously collected, but  inappropriate, commodity donations. 2) Assist callers with development of  creative fundraising activities and/or link them with other appropriate  activities / organizations. 3) Research and coordinate with existing  initiatives, and establish new ones as needed, in order to meet donor  interests. The Donations Caseworker must have experience in designing  effective and creative fundraising campaigns. Public Relations Specialist.  The Public Relations Specialist shall work to educate the general public and  specific target groups on appropriate ways to assist those affected by  overseas disasters. This person shall: 1) Research the motivation behind  non-cash assistance offers and potential alternative means of achieving  similar motivation for cash assistance. 2) Design and undertake public  education activities selected carefully for this particular issue. 3) Assist  with targeted outreach - activities targeted at selected groups of people in  the US that a) have ties (national, ethnic, cultural, religious, etc) to  countries that typically suffer large disasters or b) are historically known  to collect inappropriate commodity donations for overseas disasters. Such  targeted outreach should be undertaken both on an ongoing basis and  immediately following a disaster. 4) Assist the Donations Coordinator with  donations advocacy within the US government (including Congressional  staffers). The Public Relations Specialist must have experience with public  education, including researching reasons for a particular behavior and  developing campaigns to alter such behavior. USAID will consider any proposed  arrangement that allows these activities to be accomplished. Information  Management Specialist:  The Information Management Specialist shall develop  and maintain the website, web-based services, linkages, and associated  databases. VI.
