<DESC><p>This pre-solicitation notice is being submitted in accordance with FAR Part 5.204 and in advance of the action to extend Housing Inspection Services via modifications to existing ID/IQ contracts. The modification extensions will bridge a potential gap in coverage and is done so in accordance with the authority granted under FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1)).<br /><br />FEMA intends to extend existing contracts HSFE80-13-D-0070 and HSFE80-13-D-0074 that provide unique housing inspection services under an established Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract. Currently, the housing inspection services damage assessment field process supports the agency's emergency disaster declaration mission by enabling on-site inspection and verification of disaster related losses to homes. The verified damage assessment provides the basis for grant eligibility for survivors. The urgent need to maintain this vital service and the direct impact these services provide; are paramount to restoring the survivor's pre-disaster residential status.</p>
<p>Extending these contracts will allow FEMA to maintain the capability while developing the solicitation to compete these services in calendar year 2019.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the authority granted under FAR Part 6, this action is not set aside for Small Business.</p>
