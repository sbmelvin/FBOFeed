<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducts various types of scientific projects with the Department of Defense and other governmental agencies throughout the United States and other countries under the USGS Department of Defense Environmental Conservation (DODEC) program.  These DODEC projects investigate various types of contamination-related problems and conduct environmental studies at Federal facilities.  Typically these projects require analytical services for chemical analyses of environmental (water, solid, air, and biological) samples for organic and inorganic constituents, and geotechnical analyses of solid (sediment, sludge, and soil) samples using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) analytical methods and other published analytical methods such as Standard Methods and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods.  Legally defensible data meeting strict quality control standards are required.  Analytical services may be needed for chemical and geotechnical analyses of environmental samples collected by the USGS for other regulatory-type projects requiring USEPA or similar published, standardized analytical methods and well-documented analytical and quality-control results.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:                                   Department of Veterans Affairs
                                                                                                                  VISN 6 Network Contracting Activity                                                                       
                                                                                                                  100 Emancipation Dr

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
A new FSS order to Omnicell Incorporated.  	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
The Richmond Medical Center Pharmacy is expanding its existing Automated Pharmaceutical Dispensing and Tracking System to accommodate its increase in patients and expanded services.  The upgrade_____   includes (22) Each G4 Consoles,  (22) Each 2D Safetystock G4, (15) Each Omniboxsupplier PC Box Upgrade consoles, (37) each Touch and Go's for G4 PC Box Console.      	
	
     	
     	
     	
     	

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $ $330,628.36    	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:    June  30, 2013    	




(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
Omnicell equipment allows the pharmaceutical database to be accessed over the computer network, providing real time information of the supply status.  This allows for efficient reordering and restocking, controlled access points, and supports accountability standards set by the Joint Commission, DEA, and Board of Pharmacy.  The Omnicell system is already in use at the Richmond VAMC.  Changing to a new pharmaceutical tracking and dispensing system would incur significant duplication of costs. Similar products from other vendors cannot be incorporated into Omnicell's proprietary management system.


0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
 Due to the proprietary programming and interface required to integrate the dispensing and tracking of drugs, as well as, the liability associated with the system operations, competition is not an option at this time.  	
     	
     	
     	
     	











0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
The cost to implement a new system using a different manufacturer would present a substantial duplication of costs.  Thus, maintaining the same system represents the best value to the government.        	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
A Sources Sought was issued on GSA Ebuy.  Only Omnicell responded as it can meet the  Medical Center's requirements, has proprietary rights to the equipment and is on FSS contract.	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	



(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
  	
 All facts supporting the justification have been mentioned above.    	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
 Under the authorities and actions cited above, there are no further actions to be taken to overcome barriers to restricted consideration without considerable cost to the government.    	
     	
     	
     	
     	






























(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor's supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)
