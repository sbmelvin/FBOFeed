<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS. The Government's intent is TO AWARD A CONTRACT/PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.<br />The National Institute of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver - National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development in support of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) intends to award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition the procurement of an Amersham Imager 680 CCD imager to be held by the Laboratory of Cellular and Developmental Biology. The project background is as follows:
<p>The research groups within our branch have extensive needs to capture chemiluminescence signals as well as full color images of western blots to perform their work. Chemiluminescence is the production of light from a chemical reaction. This type of reaction is measured in a wide variety of protocols that we perform such as imaging and measuring Coomassie blue and silver stained protein gels, as well as acrylamide gels containing RNA and DNA visualized by nucleic acid stains such as SYBR Gold.</p>
<p>The Amersham Imager 680 CCD imager is a sensitive, robust, and easy-to-use CCD imager designed to provide publication-quality digital images of DNA and protein gels and blots. What separates the Imager 680 from its peer is its patented Fujifilm Super-Honeycomb CCD chip with large pixel area and Fujifilm Fujinon F 0.85 lens. This innovative technology collects more light than any other CCD camera on the market for superior sensitivity in low light applications such as chemiluminescence. It is also the only camera on the market that offers "no pixel binning." Binning allows charges from adjacent pixels to be combined and this can offer benefits in faster readout speeds and improved signal to noise ratios albeit at the expense of reduced spatial resolution. No binning increases the spatial resolution in images where chemiluminescent signals are quite low. Gaining the increased spatial resolution capability that the Imager 680 yields is critical to our need to document such reactions.</p>
<p>Our labs require an Amersham Imager 680 CCD imager, a sensitive, robust, and easy-to-use <br />CCD imager designed to provide publication-quality digital images of DNA and protein gels <br />and blots.</p>
<p>The Imager 680 is the only suitable instrument due to the following specifications:</p>
<p>1. Camera with four (4) binning modes, including "no binning" for sharper images and <br />improved resolution of closely spaced bands.<br />2. Wide-aperture f/0.85 lens, to allow the most light to be captured by the Super CCD <br />chip. This increases the sensitivity and reduces exposure time required to acquire images<br />of low abundant samples.</p>
<p>3. Camera that cools to -25&deg;C to reduce dark noise giving less background noise during <br />longer exposure times.<br />4. Image Resolution - Maximum 2816 x 2048, 5.8 Mpixel<br />5. Wavelength range: 460 to 635 nm</p>
<p>a. Epi-white light: 470 to 635 nm<br />b. Trans-white light: 470 to 635 nm<br />c. UV transillumination: 312 nm<br />d. Blue Epi light: 460 nm<br />e. Green Epi light: 520 nm<br />f. Red Epi light: 630 nm</p>
<p>6. Chemiluminescent samples and and colored molecular weight marker can be imaged simultaneously with automatic overlay. <br />7. On-board Windows 7 computer with ability to connect in a variety of configurations: <br />operate the system via an integrated computer, controlled from a wireless iPad (WiFi),<br />a USB-connected touch-screen, or a traditional monitor with a mouse and keyboard.<br />8. Dynamic range with 4.8 orders of magnitude (16 bit)<br />9. Allows for calibrated OD measurements. The system is one of the only CCD imagers<br />factory calibrated for accurate measurement of OD in coomasie or silver stained gels.<br />10. Five (5) imaging options including colorimetric, chemiluminescence, and fluorescence.</p>
<p>The manufacturer is GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., 100 Results Way, Marlboro, MA 01752. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 with a size standard of 1000 employees. The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) <br />This acquisition is conducted under the procedures prescribed in FAR subpart 13- Simplified Acquisitions Procedures at an amount less than the simplified acquisition threshold ($250,000.00) and as supplemented by FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253&copy; under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-FAR 6.302-1- Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253c (1). This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to established the interested parties bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: certification by the OEM that you are authorized to provide services, unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point ( Destination or Origin), the Duns &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and certification of business size.

Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Oct 2014) applies to this acquisition. <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement;<br />(ii) price;<br />(iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304 and DFARS 213.106-2));<br />Award shall be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror in LPTA solicitations. To be considered a technically acceptable solution for a parts procurement, the quoted parts shall meet the solicitation requirements including required parts, delivery dates, and terms and conditions stated in the solicitation. To be considered a technically acceptable solution for a service, the quoted service shall meet the solicitation requirements including terms and conditions stated in the solicitation. The quote shall state that all aspects of the technical requirement, including required delivery date and part numbers, can be met. <br />If utilized, a past performance evaluation will be conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3)(ii)(C). The Government intends to utilize the Government Wide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for past performance evaluations as a basis for anticipating successful/unsuccessful performance on this required effort. To be considered acceptable for past performance, a search of the PPIRS must reveal no negative past performance information for the recent and relevant records. In the event there are no recent and/or relevant PPIRS records, the quoter may submit information on recent and relevant subcontracts and/or commercial contracts. If no recent and relevant contracts are available in PPIRS or submitted by the offeror, the quoter's past performance record shall be considered "unknown." In the context of acceptable or unacceptable, "unknown" past performance shall be considered "acceptable." To be considered recent, the effort must either still be in progress or have been completed within the previous three (3) years from date of this draft award notice. To be considered relevant the record should be similar in terms of complexity, scope, and magnitude. "Scope" is defined as experience in areas defined in the SOW. "Magnitude" is defined as the measure of similarity of the volume, dollar value, and/or duration of work actually performed under the quoter's submitted contracts to the SOW. At the quoter's discretion, additional past performance information may be submitted with the quote as a supplement to PPIRS. If furnished, this submission will be evaluated in accordance with the procedures described above. <br />The Government will evaluate quoted pricing for reasonableness utilizing techniques described in FAR 13.106-3. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)<br />10.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure. (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations, the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
