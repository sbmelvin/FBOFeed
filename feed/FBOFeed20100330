In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(i), All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however, only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Contractor First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation</p>

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is planning to issue a Request for Proposals for residential energy systems research. This Solicitation is in support of the U.S. Department of Energys (DOEs) Building America program.  Building America forms research partnerships with all facets of the residential building industry to improve the quality and energy efficiency of existing and new homes. The goal is to develop cost effective solutions that reduce the average energy use of housing by 40% to 100%.  Research activities will focus on the development of reliable systems that dramatically reduce energy use in existing and new homes. The selected subcontractors will be required to use a multidisciplinary, team-based research approach. Subject to the availability of funds, NREL anticipates awarding up to fifteen (15) Task Ordering Agreements each with a period of performance of five (5) years.   Firm, fixed price task orders, each with a period of performance of one (1) year, will be issued under the Task Ordering Agreements.  It is anticipated that initial funding for task orders under each Task Ordering Agreement will be in the range of $500k to $2.5M for the first year, with possible funding of up to $5M for each subsequent year.  Price participation of at least 20% will be required for each task order award.  The Request for Proposals, which will include detailed information on the requested proposal scope, evaluation criteria, and proposal due date, will be posted on the NREL website at http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html  in mid-April, 2010.

The NAICS code is 334513, Instruments and Related Products Manufacturing for Measuring, Displaying, and Controlling Industrial Process Variables. The work involved with this project is for the contractor to provide: 1) ETV-4000c unit, 2) Integrated Autosampler, 3) Autotransformer, 4) Spare Parts Kit, 5) Graphite turntable, 6) Premium pyrolytically coated graphite tubes; and, 7) a recirculation chiller. The specific objective is to obtain vaporization instruments to meet lab requirements.<br />Analytical Reference Materials International Corporation is the only responsible source capable of providing a system that is designed specifically for interface with a Magnetic Sector Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS). The instrument is also capable of introduction of both, a carrier and reactive gas rather than utilizing argon alone. The instrument utilizes high quality pyrolytically coated graphite heating compartment tubes rather than tungsten alloy heating sources that contribute metals background and interfere with metals analyses in tobacco smoke. It has at the end of its graphite tube, an additional Argon-stream (bypass-gas), added to transform any halogenized vapour into a dry and saturated aerosol and protect the cooler terminal of the tube to prevent metal halide condensation that otherwise would create signal-disturbing memory efforts and double peaks. The furnace is powered by a programmable computer-controlled power supply for various temperature-programs up to 3000C. The software permits easy programming. This system also has a graphite autosampler rather than permitting only manual sample loading.<br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Analytical Reference Materials International Corporation. However, firms that believe they can provide these services/supplies are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice to the Contract Specialist by April 14, 2010.<br />A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries/Capability Statements&nbsp;shall be sent to Lynn Walling by email at lqw5@cdc.gov. and reference #81398 on subject line.<br />

This Justification and Approval(J&A) is for procurement of Blank Smart Card 330 with Artwork on a brand name onlybasis.
(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. Blank Smart Cards for continued use in support of the Department's PKI program. (3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value): The State Department PKI program uses Precise Biometrics' Precise 200 MC hardware (smartcard and biometrics fingerprint readers). Precise certified biometric readers are part of a PKI system, which consists of Entrust software suite, SafeNet smart cards, SafeNet Cryptographic Interface Provider (CIP) middleware, and Precise readers. Interoperability of the components is essential to a functional system; components not certified by Precise will prove non-functional in this configuration. Other smart cards have been tested and have been found to be non-compatible with the current PKIIBLADE configuration. (4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. IRM/OPS/ITIISI requires SafeNet Smartcard 330's to be procured on a brand name only basis. Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(l), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited: Safenet packages the correct, certified drivers as part of the standard CIP middleware. This is a product that the US Department of State currently has installed. Installation of different software versions will have the following issues: &#19968;.	1. Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configurations &#19968;.	2. The Precise 200 MC has multiple versions firmware and thus multiple drivers. Interoperability cannot be guaranteed, nor will a single supplier support it. 3. Support for functional enhancements made to the system, as part of BLADE or future modifications cannot be guaranteed to be supported. A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. 	Safenet is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch and support their software, as well as replace defective hardware with equipment with identical technical specification to those currently installed, Safenet, Inc. is the sole source	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take t remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. PKVI3LADE is a COTS solution that provides PKI functionality and biometric authentication to the OpenNet. Even though it is a COTS solution, it is also a proprietary solution.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:
Requesting Agency:  U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Arizona Ecological Services Office, Tucson Sub Office 
Contracting Agency:   U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region 2, Buenos Aires NWR
Action to be Approved:  Sole Source Purchase of a soft release ensloure specific to needs of the Mount Graham Red Squirrel from Corners Limited (DUNS # 001741875)
Supplies Required:  Custom designed enclosure for Mt. Graham Red Squirrel
Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1. This announcement is published as a Sole Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. Arizona time, April 6, 2010 will be considered by the Government.   POC: Anna Hirales, Contracting Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (520) 823-4251 Ext. 122.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Anna Hirales via e-mail at Anna_Hirales@fws.gov or fax (520) 823-4247.  Technical Questions POC:  Marit Alanen, U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service  Biologist, Arizona Ecological Services Office, (520) 670-6150  Ext. 234 or email at Marit_Alanen@fws.gov.
Demonstration of requirement of authority:  Given the unique design requirements for a soft-release enclosure for the  Mt Graham red squirrel Corners Limited is the best option for purchase.  Corners Limited was recommended by Phoenix Zoo as a company that could build custom-designed soft release enclosure specific to the needs and location of the Mt. Graham red squirrel.  Arizona Ecological Services Office obtained a price quote from Corners Limited and attempted to obtain quotes from nine other companies selected from Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Efforts to ensure offers from as wide a range of suppliers as possible was made. 
Three companies provided websites from which Arizona Ecological Services Office was able to determine the company would not be able to meet the species-specific needs of the design (one was an engineering firm, one was a supplier of screening material only and did not build structures, and one fabricated wire only and did not build structures).  Two other companies replied via phone that they did not engage in this type of work (one dealt only with industrial products, while the other only provided materials and did not build structures).  The remaining four companies replied they would look at the design to determine if they could meet the necessary requirements.  After being sent design, one company replied they could not meet these requirements, another company replied they could not find the proper source materials required for the enclosure, and two did not reply.

<DESC>RECOVERY  KNOX_BIOMASS_REMOVAL_TASKORDERS_STEWARDSHIP, HAZARDOUS FUELS REDUCTION DELIVERY ORDERS  MALHEUR NATIONAL FOREST-THIS IS AN AMERICAN AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) PROCUREMENT.

THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  This opportunity is only available to the contractor(s) who were awarded the contract(s) for work in response to Solicitation No. AG-04R3-S-09-8113, COLLABORATIVE RESTORATION STEWARDSHIP, ON THE UMATILLA, WALLOWA-WHITMAN, MALHEUR AND OCHOCO NATIONAL FORESTS.  The original solicitation was competitively advertised as a Commercial Items RFP.  The Government intends to award multiple Delivery Orders from a single request for quotations.  This project will be partially or wholly funded with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds and is subject to all reporting requirements thereto.

The collaborative Restoration Stewardship contract is an integrated resource contract that includes ground-based logging, cable logging, and product transportation as well as slash treatment.  The issuance of these Delivery Orders require the contractor(s) to reduce the potential of high intensity wildfire by removing or rearranging the existing fuel loading on the forest floor.  This particular project title is Knox Biomass Removal, which is located on the Malheur national Forest.  All biomass removed will remain the property of the US Government and be transported by service contractor to local processors.  This work will result in retaining healthy, vigorous understory trees at an average spacing of 20 feet to improve tree conditions and forest health, reduce ladder fuels located beneath overstory trees to reduce individual tree torching potential, provided a fuel loading profile that promotes defensible space for fire suppression, and for the re-introduction of fire in the project area.  Fuel loading objectives relate to the remaining tons/acre and size of material left after treatment.  Target fuel loading objective is to have no more than 5 to 10 tons per acre left once the work is completed.  Slash Treatment where required will be accomplished using mechanized equipment to masticate (chip) the slash.

This project requires removal of approximately 26,360 tons of non-saw and saw material (merchantable woody biomass).

The resultant Task Order Contract(s) will be a firm-fixed price, with requirements for biomass removal.

<p>Multiple contracts will be awarded and each will be administered on a work assignment-managed basis. Work assignments will be issued under the "funded cost-reimbursement, multiyear" contracts resulting from this solicitation. Assignments are estimated to involve two to three chemical agents annually, per contract The objectives of the work assignments in relative order of importance are: 1) assessment of acute and subacute toxicity in rodents and dogs including determination of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), schedule-dependent toxicity, of the reversibility of adverse effects and of a safe clinical starting dose; 2) validation of analytical methodology to quantitate plasma drug levels in preclinical animal models and to measure plasma drug levels in rodents, dogs and/or non-human primates treated with the agent under study; 3) determination of bioavailability of drug after parenteral and/or oral administration, if efficacious drug levels can be attained in plasma in vivo and if the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier; 4) the use of pharmacokinetic information to permit extrapolation of toxic effects across species by relating plasma drug levels to the time of appearance and severity of toxicity; and to establish the safety of potentially efficacious doses.</p>
<p>The Principal Investigator should have a doctoral degree in pharmacology/ toxicology plus at least five years experience in directing, implementing and evaluating drug toxicity studies in experimental animals. The Pathologist, Pharmacokineticist and Analytical Chemist should likewise have credentials that illustrate their competence and accomplishments in serving as critical team members in the conduct of such studies.</p>
<p>The government anticipates multiple awards of multiyear contracts with increments of funding. <br /><br />Mandatory Qualification/Mandatory Exclusion Criteria:</p>
<p>The GLP qualification must be met at the time of submission of the initial proposal. Since the toxicology studies will be used by the National Cancer Institute to satisfy the safety testing requirement of the Food and Drug Administration in the submission of an Investigational New Drug Application, the studies must be conducted and the data must be stored in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice Regulations as outlined in the Federal Register Friday, December 22, 1978.</p>
<p>The NCI also signs legally binding agreements with certain suppliers (often pharmaceutical or chemical companies) which state that all information on the compounds submitted by the supplier must be held confidential. The Contractor will be expected to evaluate the toxicity of such commercially confidential (discreet) materials. Therefore, the Contractor must be willing to sign a Confidentiality of Information Agreement at the time of award.</p>
<p>Mandatory Exclusion Criterion</p>
<p>The Offeror may not be a pharmaceutical, chemical, or biotechnology firm.

<SUBJECT>Recovery Act Contract Action - Providing radiologic outcomes for the Osteoarthritis Initiative through longitudinal, blinded to order qualitative and quantitative assessment x-ray analysis of knee joint changes
<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NIAMS-10-24
<RESPDATE>092409
<ARCHDATE>11022009
<CONTACT>Lisa A Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-0346, Fax 301-480-3432, Email lh314r@nih.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY ACT CONTRACT ACTION  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The UCSF is located at 3333 California Street San Francisco, CA 94143.  

The Osteoarthritis Initiative is a public-private partnership to generate research resources to increase knowledge and improve understanding of the onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis in the population.  The goals of the Osteoarthritis Initiative are currently being fulfilled through five current NIH funded research and development contracts.  Four of these contracts are awarded to clinical centers to enroll subjects, collect data and follow the cohort, and one contract is the data coordinating center to manage the study and to establish and maintain the database.  The purpose of this requirement is to provide x-ray readings and scoring of knee x-rays from the baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 48 month x-rays from the participants of the Osteoarthritis Initiative.  This will provide outcome data to enrich the database.  These readings will allow users to know whether subjects without disease have developed disease or subjects with disease have gotten worse.  This information is critical for evaluation of potential risk factors for development or progression of disease.  Providing these readings through UCSFs standardized method will eliminate the variability that would result from many different individuals reading these x-rays independently. The resultant data will be posted on the Osteoarthritis Initiative public website after review by the staff at the data coordinating center at the UCSF. 

Two types of readings, done in a blinded to order manner are required: quantitative assessment of joint space width and change in joint space and semi-quantitative assessment of joint changes including the Kellgren-Lawrence score. The proposed readings are not commercial items.  They are not conventional clinical readings that might be offered by a radiology department to primary care doctors for diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis. Rather, they are research readings that require the collection of a large set of predefined variables from the radiographs that are useful only in the research setting. These readings require structured protocols to maximize the accuracy and reduce sources of error. These readings are unique to research assessments due to the following requirements: assessment of a large set of individual radiographic features, which are not used clinically, readings of grouped images from multiple time points for precise measurement of change, readings of images blinded to chronological order, use of multiple readers to assess same images to increase accuracy and reduce error, identification and adjudication of discrepancies between multiple readers by outside party, precise measurement of joint space width at multiple points across the joint and precise comparisons of change in joint space width from image to image.  

Capability Statements will be reviewed based upon the following criteria: 

1.Ability to provide reliable readings using well established and accepted methodologies for both quantitative and semi-quantitative assessment of longitudinal x-rays from the OAI.
2.Ability to properly handle, process, store, and disburse x-rays and data.
3.Ability to work cooperatively with the Government to establish clear and well documented policies and procedures for access to x-rays/data.
4.Ability to work cooperatively with the Government to address various ethical, legal, policy, and regulatory issues related to collection, access, and distribution of x-rays including evidence that the offeror is familiar with processes and procedures relevant to shipping and receiving x-rays to and from subcontractor sites.
5.Documented training and expertise for various tasks related to the operation and maintenance and familiarity with various ethical, legal, and policy and regulatory issues related to collection, access, and distribution of x-rays.
6.Leadership and management structure must include the documented training, experience, leadership, and availability of a lead Principal Investigator with solid research program management experience. It should also include documented experience in managing subcontracts.  It should demonstrate the availability of proposed staff for the conduct of the project and the clarity and appropriateness of assigned roles and responsibilities. 
7.The offeror should demonstrate availability and accessibility of existing resources such as computer equipment, computer software, web systems, data security, and office space necessary to effectively carry out all phases of the proposed project, including plans for back-up in case of equipment malfunction.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the NIAMS. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must demonstrate the ability to provide the x-ray reading services and assessments as well as the facilities and staffing to perform these services, as described above.  All responses must be received in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIAMS to determine if the party is capable of performing this requirement (responses should not exceed 20 pages including attachments). Responses providing insufficient information will not be considered.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  The NAICS code associated with this requirement is 541712. Statements of capability must be received at the following address (or by email as a Word document or PDF) no later than 4:00 pm local time, September 24, 2009:  National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Rockledge II  Room 6102, 6701 Rockledge Drive  MSC 7902, Bethesda, MD  20892-7902 (use 20817 for express mail), Attention: Lisa A.

The OAAG has a need for an experienced and knowledgeable Youth Violence Initiative Consultant, with extensive contacts and relationships in the field, to assist in the development, strategic planning and management of the initiative. The Youth Violence Initiative Consultant will serve as a ambassador, spokesperson and senior advisor for a national effort to combat youth violence and gang activity The OJP provides innovative leadership to federal, state, local, and tribal justice systems, working in partnership with the justice community to identify the most pressing crime-related challenges confronting the justice system and to provide information, training, coordination, and innovative strategies and approaches for addressing these challenges. The OAAG is responsible for the overall management and oversight of OJP. This includes setting policy; ensuring that OJP policies and programs reflect the priorities of the President, the Attorney General, and the Congress; and promoting coordination among OJP offices and bureaus. The OAAG is currently developing a federal multi-agency initiative to address youth violence and gang activity. The Department of Justice, along with other federal agencies, will assist localities in establishing networks in their own communities and with others across the country in order to share knowledge and experience in what works and what doesn't in fighting youth violence and gang activity. As localities work across silos to address these issues, the federal government will do the same, providing additional multi-agency support in the form of needs assessment, strategic planning, and other types of technical assistance. The objective of the Youth Violence Initiative is to identify localities with serious and persistent youth violence and help build a foundation for effective and sustainable youth violence reduction activities. The objective of the Consultant is to help ensure the success of the initiative. Mr. Calhoun is considered to be an expert in the field of Youth Violence Initiatives and has served as the President and CEO of the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) for 20 years and currently manages the 13-California City Gang Prevention Network for the National League of Cities Institute for Youth, Education and Families. As President and CEO of NCPC, Mr. Calhoun designed and ran path-breaking initiatives including: Youth as Resources, a program that ask youth to identify social issues that concern them and then design and run projects to address those issues. He created and oversaw programs in neighborhoods most beset by crime, basing those programs on a twin philosophy: prevention of crime and building vital communities that did not produce crime. He helped pioneer entire jurisdiction-wide initiatives, which combined crime-fighting with community development strategies in 32 major cities across America, and he designed the Embedding Prevention in State Policy and Practice, a six - state initiative designed to convince selected states to invest in communities and families up front rather than waiting for expensive back end solutions.<br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. However, all responsible parties who identify their interest and capability to satisfy this requirement will be considered. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, all requests for the solicitation will be considered non-responsive. A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is in the sole discretion of the Government. All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities in writing to OJP, 810 7th Street, NW, Room 3625, Washington, D.C. 20531, and Attn.: Karen Washington, by email at Karen.Washington@usdoj.gov or by facsimile at 202-354-4363 within seven days of the published date of this notice. Documents over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile. Verification of receipt of fax and email transmission is the sole responsibility of the contractor. All OJP contractors are required to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receipt of an award. If no competitive responses are received, an award will be made to Mr. John Calhoun.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Synopsis: HSCG47-10-R-3EFK04<br />This is a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Design/Build for Upgrading the Water Distributions System, U. S. Coast Guard Training Center, Yorktown, VA. This Design/Build project involves the complete rehabilitation of the TRACEN Base wide potable/drinking water and non-potable/fire-protection raw water distribution systems. The existing undersized and inadequate dual systems of 6' and 8' piping will be enlarged to 8', 10' and 12' waterlines utilizing a combination of installation methods (e. g. open cut trenching, pipe bursting, or horizontal directional drilling) that will ultimately be dependent on the contractor's final accepted design. Upon project completion, the TRACEN will be under one water system supplied in its entirety by the Newport News Water Works (NNWW) distribution system. Thus, the existing inadequate fire protection system supplied via a raw water source from Wormley Pond will be totally gutted and replaced with a new potable water system of increased pipe sizes and new fire hydrants. Likewise, the rehabilitation of the existing antiquated potable water system will also include the abandonment of the existing elevated tank and a major facilities wide water metering upgrade involving either the replacement or installation of new water meters. All meters will be tied together with a modernized telemetric metering recording system. The project will require the use of specialized construction in known areas of heavy existing congested underground utilities, hazardous petroleum plumes, and archaeological historic areas.

<p>This is a request for information (RFI) / SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.

Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p>AFMETCAL is considering an anticipated sole source purchase of a PBS-4100 Vib Balance Analyzer Cal Kit. A Calibration Kit is required to calibrate all of the various versions of the PBS-4100 Portable Vibration Balance Analyzers including all charge amplifiers made by MTI Instruments of Albany NY. The Kit must contain a precision signal source, and all of the necessary cables and adapters to connect this source to all of the different PBS-4100s and its charge amplifiers. Also included in this package is software that automates the calibration of the PBS-4100 with this signal source and also operates the calibration of the signal source itself. Lastly, this kit must also contain all accessories required to fully calibrate the source. The precision signal source must feature two independent signal output channels. It must provide voltage; AC (Sine, Square, Triangle, and Saw-tooth waveforms) from 0 to 9.999 Volts Pk, and from 0.1 to 100 KHz in 0.1 Hz increments and DC at +/-9.999 VDC. And also include Single and Double Ended Charge signals from 0 to 9999.9 pC PK to simulate accelerometer and other charge mode devices. Both signals at an accuracy of +/-0.05%. The signal source must also have the capability to generate speed signals, tachometer signals, multi-tooth gears and odd-pulsed signals.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a competitive small business set-aside procurement for advisory and assistance services to Evaluate the Impact of Incentives Demonstrations on Participation in the Summer Food Service Program. USDA is committed to ending childhood hunger by 2015. A key challenge in meeting this commitment is the problem that food insecurity increases over the summer months, a period when school lunches and breakfasts are unavailable to most children. USDA's Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) was developed to "fill the gap" and provide meals to needy children during the months when school is not in session. However, peak SFSP participation has rarely exceeded 10-15 percent of average participation in free and reduced-price school lunches.<br />FNS seeks a qualified contractor to gather administrative data that can help FNS determine whether meaningful increases in participation (coverage) occur if (i) summer feeding providers are given financial incentives to increase their number of operating days or (ii) funds are made available for educational and recreational activities and programs that engage children and give them incentives to keep coming back.<br />For Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 and for as many of the fiscal years from 2006 to 2009 as feasible, collect specified administrative information from all demonstration States and up to 4 comparison States to be selected by FNS; organize the information into a statistical database (SAS or SPSS). Most information items are reported by States to FNS on forms FNS-418, FNS-143, and FNS-269. Some of the administrative data to be compiled is on file at the State level and the remainder of the administrative data is on file at the SFSP Sponsor level.
<p>Interested parties may submit capability statements that demonstrate its ability to perform all elements of the requirement as described in this notice. Your response must include a description of your past experience on at least three (3) similar projects consistent in scope, size and complexity with this requirement which you performed in the past three years. Contact information for references on the described, similar projects shall also be provided. All responses must be submitted to belal.hammad@fns.usda.gov NO LATER THAN 4:00 p.m. on April 02, 2010. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For questions concerning this notice, please contact Belal Hammad, Contract Specialist, at 703-305-2262.</p>
<p>Please limit the length of the packages to 20 pages. Packages over 20 pages will not be evaluated.</p>

<DESC><p>The Mine Safety &amp; Health Administration (MSHA) is seeking to determine whether additional sources are available to provide respirable dust cassettes used by MSHA personnel to measure levels of dust exposure when&nbsp;conducting mine inspections. <br /><br />The current dust cassette being utilized by MSHA is Mine Safety Appliances (MSA) Part # 10011208.&nbsp; The following are some, but not all, of the specifications required for MSHA's dust cassettes:<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Filter Media</span></strong></p>
<p>The filter media should be a 5 micron, 37 mm diameter, non-hydroscopic polyvinyl chloride formulation. The filter resistance shall be not more than 2 inches of water at an air flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The aerosol retention per ASTM D2986-95A should be 99.9%+ for .3 micron dioctyl phthalate (DOP) at 32L/min/100cm2 of filter media. Air flow rates attainable at 10 psi should be approximately 53L/min/cm2 of filter area. The media should maintain these performance characteristics up to an ambient temperature of 125Fo.<br />A six digit cassette number and a bar code shall be imprinted on the back (non-sampling) side of the filter using indelible, fast drying ink. The filter shall have an ash content of less than 1% by weight, and neither the filter nor ink shall contain material which, after ashing or dissolution of the filter media, would interfere with the determination of silica by NIOSH Method 7500.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Filter Capsule</span></strong></p>
<p>The removable capsule enclosing the filter should not permit sampled air to leak around the filter. It should be composed of non-hydroscopic material in the shape of a frustum, with a base diameter not to exceed 39 mm in diameter and a height not to exceed 4 mm. The top of the frustum shall be not less than 12 mm in diameter and shall be the site of the sample inlet port. The filter media and supports shall be sealed to the base of assembly, with the cassette number and bar code facing outward. The walls of the frustum should be constructed of aluminum foil to expedite recovery of the sample filters for silica analysis. <br />The weight of the capsule shall not exceed 5 g . Impact to the capsule should not dislodge sampled dust from the capsule which might be lost to the weight measurement. Capsules should be assembled in such a manner that the 99% confidence interval for weight stability of unused filters over a two year period is a weight change of between -30 micrograms to +60 micrograms.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cassette<br /></span></strong><br />The cassette shall enclose the capsule so as to prevent leakage around the capsule and to prevent contamination. The cassette must be constructed so as to prevent a loss or gain in capsule weight during cassette assembly or disassembly. Appropriate covers shall be provided to seal the cassette when it is not in use, thus preventing contamination of the sample media and maintaining sample integrity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is not a solicitation.&nbsp; At the present, MSHA is only seeking vendors that have an interest in and can provide the product.&nbsp; <br /><br />Attached are several pictures of dust cassettes and components, and of the filter capsules with MSHA's robot accessories.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please respond to Rhonda Sizemore, Contracting Officer, at <a href="mailto:Sizemore.Rhonda@dol.gov">Sizemore.Rhonda@dol.gov</a>.&nbsp; No phone calls please.&nbsp; Deadline to respond is Tuesday, April 6, 2010 at 3:00 p.m. EST.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The USGS requests a frequency domain helicopter electromagnetic survey of the area around Ft Yukon Alaska for the investigation of permafrost. These data are intended for 1-D and 2-D numerical inversion to determine the 3-D extent of continuous and discontinuous permafrost within the study area. These data will be used to create a hydrological framework to be input into a groundwater model for the investigation of potential global change impacts within the Yukon Flats. The USGS requires a system that is well suited for near surface investigations and has the capability for recording multiple frequencies from 140k Hz down to 400 Hz.  The system must also be capable of differentiating resistive units within electrically resistive areas. The data must be well calibrated and corrected for any system response and drift. These data will provide the basis for the use of HEM in further investigations of permafrost.  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, and facilities, required for conducting a frequency domain helicopter electromagnetic (HEM-FDEM) and magnetic survey of the permafrost area in Alaska. The contractor shall provide digitally recorded and processed airborne data.  An example of recently flown data shall be submitted with each offeror's quotation. The goal of this survey is to provide high quality data that will produce Conductivity-Depth Images (CDI's) of the subsurface. This data set is to be used for geological framework studies and is not a simple conductive target mapping exercise. The data collected shall be of such quality that they can be calibrated and inverted.  The USGS is in search of small business firms who are able to perform the above mentioned services.  Small business firms who feel they can furnish the required services or its functional equivalent (based on criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement within three (3) calendar days from date of this notification.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required services state herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exists.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request

<p dir="ltr">It is anticipated that the center will provide services related to strategic planning, systems engineering, security and information protection in tasks related to design, architecture, configuration, integration, infrastructure of systems and applications and related technology which will enable the AOUSC to implement and maintain the highest level of services for the courts, litigants and the public. The center will be able to offer the enterprise familiarity and objective expertise available from an FFRDC that is not otherwise available within the AOUSC or by contract in the competitive marketplace.

A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>A search was conducted between 8 March and 11 March 2010 using Internet search engines, the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) database, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) Dynamic Small Business Search. The CCR and SBA search referenced NAICS code 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing and keywords Mass Spectrometer.<BR><BR>The SBA Dynamic Small Business Search returned small businesses associated with both the NAICS 334516 and the relevant keywords.<BR>The vendors found during the search could not provide the software capable of being used with the Shimadzu LCMS-2010EV. <BR><BR>Internet research found that the model that best meet the salient characteristics of The LC/MS computer system is available from a single vendor. There are LC/MS systems available from different manufacturers available on the market. Each manufacturer produces a proprietary computer software system to work specifically with their LCMS system. As there is an existing Shimadzu LCMS-2010EV at the study at Penn State those computers software systems do not fit the salient characteristics. The LC/MS computer system sold by Shimadzu best meets the requirements. <BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:   None<BR><BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>Since The Discovery, Early Detection, Evaluation, Treatment and Prevention in Cancer Research at Penn State already has the Shimadzu LCMS-2010EV the only manufacturer that can provide the equipment that meets the salient characteristics is Shimadzu. LC/MS systems and the computer systems that enable their use are proprietary to the manufacturers that produce the LC/MS hardware. There does not appear to be any actions that this agency can take to remove or overcome barriers to competition.<BR><BR><BR><BR>6.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) on Deployable Reactor Technologies for Generating Power and Logistic Fuels
<p>Description</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is requesting information on innovative technologies and approaches that may enable the development of deployable nuclear reactor technologies for the generation of electrical power and military logistic fuels (JP-8) in forward land based and maritime military operations.<br /> <br />Recent advances in high temperature materials science suggest that an investigation of compact, deployable nuclear reactor technologies may be timely.  The goal would be to create a fieldable design that could be deployed to maritime and/or ground based forward operations to provide on-site power and fuel production capability in regions not connected to a robust grid and/or not easily accessible for fuel resupply.  Preferred reactor designs would allow for several years of operation without refueling.  Technical approaches to fuel production should accommodate a broad range of hydrogen and carbon feedstocks (water/seawater, biomass, waste materials, etc.).  Concepts that involve carbon capture or sequestration should be well justified in terms of technical feasibility given known carbon concentrations in the proposed carrier stream.</p>
<p>DARPA/STO is interested in design concepts that are inherently safe (negative temperature coefficient), do not produce waste products which would contribute to proliferation problems, and which could be readily deployed for power generation and fuel production using available indigenous feedstocks.</p>
<p>Currently, electrical power generation in ground based forward operating bases is primarily provided by fuel burning generators.  Delivering fuel to these bases can be a significant logistics challenge and may place military personnel and/or defense contractors at risk.  For maritime applications the ability to recharge and refuel various Naval platforms could greatly extend mission range and duration.  The goal of this RFI is to identify and preliminarily assess the feasibility of providing U.S. military forward operations an unprecedented self sufficiency in terms of electricity and mobility fuel production.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this RFI, DARPA/STO is interested in nuclear powered generator design concepts that produce both electricity and mobility fuel.  The total energy output of the generator design should support an electrical load of 5 to 10 MW in addition to producing 15,000 gallons/day of fuel from indigenous hydrogen and carbon feedstocks.  It may be assumed that the desired fuel end product is JP-8; however, responders should discuss the degree to which their fuel production technology could be used to produce other mobility fuels including gasoline and diesel fuels.</p>
<p>ABSTRACT SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS AND FORMAT<br /> <br />To respond to this RFI, interested parties should submit a cover sheet and abstract to include information outlined below. The cover sheet and abstract must be submitted by Friday, April 30, 2010 by 4:00 p.m. (Eastern) to the following email address: DARPA-SN-10-37@darpa.mil</p>
<p>Abstracts should briefly summarize the technical concepts and approaches within a single page, excluding figures, references and the cover page. No proprietary or classified information should be included in response to this RFI. Format specifications include 12 point font, single-spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches paper, with 1-inch margins in either Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format.</p>
<p>1. Cover Page (1 page)</p>
<p>Title</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>Respondent's technical and administrative points of contact (names, addresses, phones and fax numbers, and email addresses)</p>
<p>2. Abstract (2 pages)</p>

<p>Respondents are encouraged to be as succinct as possible while providing sufficient detail to adequately convey the technical concepts, challenges and approaches.</p>
<p>ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>DARPA invites participation from all those engaged in related research activities and appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources including, but not limited to, universities, university-affiliated research centers, federally-funded research centers, private or public companies and Government research laboratories.</p>

<DESC>Contract # 40181RY029Award amount: $100,000.00Date of Award: March 17, 2010
The goal of this project is to reduce pine density on 855 acres of Florida Scrub Jay habitat Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge.  The contractor will cut pines using chainsaws throughout the project area.
A Time & Material contract was awarded due to the work area being large and difficult to access, which was difficult to accurately map treatment sites.  Contractors would have a difficult time visually assessing the amount of vegetation which would need to be treated.  If this contract were fixed price, many contractors would be discouraged from bidding due to inability to fully assess what work is actually required, or alternatively, they may have significantly increased their prices to take into consideration  potential risk (of underbidding).  A Time & Materials contract will provide the flexibility to maximize the use of available funds and allow treatment of the most problematic areas.

The goal of this project is to restore wetland swales on approximately1084 acres within Florida Scrub Jay Habitat Reserves at Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge.  This project will remove the woody vegetation, allowing the emergent grasses to return.  The project includes cutting and stump herbicide treating hardwood trees and shrubs within wetlands.  All trees will be felled using hand tools, i.e. chainsaws.  All stumps will be treated with herbicide using the current control practices for optimal woody control.

<CONTACT>Lakita C. Ayers, Phone 2022831351, Email lakita.c.ayers@irs.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT :  Address Hygiene Software Enterprise License for Mail Management Project 

The Internal Revenue Service intends to award on a sole source basis a delivery order for address hygiene software products, to a single GSA Schedule contractor.  This purchase order will be made under the Authority of FAR Part 8.404  Use of Federal Supply Schedules.  

IRS has a variety of systems and applications which use taxpayer mailing addresses to send IRC required notices and letters. Currently, these systems use multiple licenses for FINALIST and Code One Plus software products to perform address validation. The licenses, however, are only for batch-mode and only access from ECC-MTB is allowed.  
The agency has a need to improve its address hygiene processes in order to cut correspondence costs and improve the effectiveness of taxpayer contacts.
These requirements apply globally to all systems (whether modernized or legacy) which input, update, maintain or otherwise modify foreign or domestic address information.

1.	Enterprise Licensing for all domestic and international address validation/hygiene processing. The license will provide the following capabilities:

a.	coverage for both batch and real-time availability processing.
b.	coverage for remote and site access to the software.
c.	coverage on all Tier 1 (e.g., IRS IBM and Unisys) computing environments and applications including GMF, CADE, AMS & CADE 2.  
d.	coverage for production, development, testing and disaster recovery environments and on multiple LPARS that support address hygiene processing. 
e.	coverage for all Tier 2 platforms which perform address hygiene including
AIX, WINTEL, UNIX and SOLARIS. 
f.	coverage for Tier 3 (e.g., Windows-based) systems which perform address hygiene. 
g.	coverage for web-based environments including modernized eFile which require taxpayer address validation.  
h.	compatibility with all database software used for addressing (e.g., DB2 and Oracle.)

2.	The license will provide a product or products that meet all applicable USPS standards for address validation, and which will be updated with all USPS & available international delivery point changes on at least a monthly basis.
IRS has made no architectural decisions on using address hygiene software in a centralized or distributed manner or in a mix of approaches. Therefore, the license must allow for a mix of approaches with various IRS systems and applications and must readily facilitate changes in the softwares IRS deployment and use.

Only Pitney Bowes Inc., has expertise in providing this unique software which the IRS has already been using for many years.  Its portability, transparent operability and existing IRS internal knowledge across mainframe, UNIX, LINUS, and windows provides for a seamless process. The address hygiene software needed is immediate due to the critical nature of the required support for existing applications.

Pitney Bowes Inc., is the only Federal Supply Schedule holder for Address Hygiene Software License.   This acquisition will be fulfilled by the delivery of Pitney Bowes for Mail Management Project Office.

Questions can be e-mailed to Lakita.c.ayers@irs.gov

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole source agreement with Budris-Consulting, 10 Peregrine Dr., Washington NJ, 07882 for follow on work relating to independent analysis in the hydrodynamics and mechanical performance of centrifugal pumps.
<p>A competitive award of purchase order DR-09-270 was made to Budris-Consulting on September 25, 2009, entitled, "Criterion for the Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) Margin to Apply to Containment Overpressure." Under this contract, Mr. Budris completed four tasks related to the NPSH for pumps used in reactor emergency core cooling system and containment heat removal systems and developed estimates of uncertainty in the required NPSH for these pumps at the 3 % head loss value. Budris-Consulting recommended how this information can be included in a criterion for the NPSH margin. The methodology and approach Budris-Consulting developed to arrive at these recommendations became instrumental in the development of NRC's revised draft criteria for centrifugal pump net positive suction head operating margin during postulated reactor accident conditions including pump performance in cavitation. This purchase Order DR-09-270 expired on December 18, 2009.</p>
<p>Budris-Consulting expertise is required to support the NRC staff in discussions with the industry in explaining the criteria and justifying the criteria for the use of containment accident pressure in determining available NPSH to both the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards and the NRC Commission.</p>
<p>The period of performance of this follow on effort is four months from date of award.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. Request for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services. Inquiries regarding this announcement may be made to Jeffrey R. Mitchell, Contracting Officer by phone at (301) 492-3639 or via e-mail at Jeffrey.Mitchell@nrc.gov.</p>
<p>This announcement was posted on March 30, 2010 and will close on April 9, 2010.</p>

(See attachment 1 - Performance Work Statement)</p>

<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is 611512 (Flight Training)</p>
<p>This combined synopsis/solicitation contains all incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38, Effective 1 Feb 10.</p>
<p>The following provisions and clauses are applicable:</p>
<p>52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Offerors are required to submit their offers in four sections:</p>
<p>Section 1: Price <br />See Attachment 2 for Price/CLIN Schedule</p>
<p>Section 2: Technical Capability (not to exceed 20 pages. Page size 8.5x11, Times New Roman, 12 Font). The offeror must meet or exceed ALL technical evaluation factors to be determined technically acceptable. If the lowest priced offeror is determined to be technically acceptable, no further evaluation will be made on other offers received for this procurement. If the lowest priced offeror is not determined to be technically acceptable, the Government will evaluate the next lowest priced offeror until a technically acceptable offer is identified.</p>
<p>Technical Capability will be assessed based on the following information:</p>
<p>a. Interested Offerors shall describe in their proposal what type of manned-fixed aircraft they intend to use. (Reference: PWS paragraph 4.0)</p>
<p>b. Interested Offerors shall describe in their proposal the video system equipment performance criteria. (Reference: PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.1.4)</p>

<p>h. Interested Offerors shall include in their proposals credentials to address the PWS's requirements of appropriate certificates and qualifications required by FAA. (Reference: PWS paragraph 1.3)</p>
<p>Section 3: Representations and Certifications per FAR 52.212-3 (This item will be considered met if current Reps and Certs are available on ORCA)</p>
<p>Section 4: Offeror shall submit up to a total of three (3) past performance contract references on contracts considered most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform this effort. This information is required on the offeror, subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture partners proposed to perform at least 25 percent of the total effort based on the total proposed price, or those that will perform aspects of the effort the Offeror considers critical to performing the contract. References must include the company name, contract number, point of contact, valid contact address and phone number, and a brief synopsis of the contract requirement.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be used only as part of the Responsibility Determination - it is NOT an evaluation factor, and will not be taken into consideration in determining technical acceptability.</p>
<p>52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration</p>
<p>52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers--Commercial Items:</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated using two factors which are as follows and listed from most to least important: (1) Price, and (2) Technical. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror. The offeror must meet or exceed ALL technical evaluation factors to be determined technically acceptable. If the lowest priced offeror is determined to be technically acceptable, no further evaluation will be made on other offers received for this procurement. If the lowest priced offeror is not determined to be technically acceptable, the Government will evaluate the next lowest priced offeror until a technically acceptable offer is identified. The Government does intend to make award without discussions but reserves the right to hold discussions if determined in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors for award of this requirement are Price and Technical Capability.</p>
<p>Price will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Price will be evaluated for reasonableness. A combination of evaluation techniques will be accomplished IAW FAR 15.404-1(b). The Government will evaluate proposed prices to determine whether prices reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's technical proposal. Price analysis techniques may include a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation, comparison with other contract prices for similar services, and/or comparison of proposed prices with the independent government cost estimate. Proposals will then be ranked by total evaluated price from lowest to highest. This will include the total proposed price of the basic contract period and total price for all options. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise option(s). Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer.</p>
<p>Technical Capability will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide a technical proposal showing how they intend to address the following specific PWS requirements:<br />a. Proposed manned-fixed aircraft must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraph 4.0.</p>
<p>b. Proposed video system equipment must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.1.4.</p>
<p>c. Proposed air to ground communication capability must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraphs 4.0, and 4.1.4.</p>
<p>d. Proposed air to air communication capability must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.1.4.</p>
<p>e. Proposed cockpit to cabin interphone capability must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.1.4.</p>
<p>f. Proposed ability to conduct training within a 20 mile radius of Tinker AFB, OK must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.4.</p>
<p>g. Proposed resumes that support key personnel's qualification and ability to perform ground and flight task requirements must as a minimum meet the requirements to PWS paragraph 1.3.</p>
<p>h. Proposed credentials to address the PWS's requirements of appropriate certificates and qualifications required by FAA must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraph 1.3.</p>
<p>Technical proposals will be rated Acceptable, if they meet the government's requirements. Reasonably Susceptible of being made Acceptable, if there is doubt regarding whether an aspect of the proposal meets a specified measure of merit established in their technical approach, or Unacceptable, if it fails to meet specified measure of merit established in their technical approach. All Unacceptable proposals will be eliminated from the competitive range and will not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Past Performance<br />Past Performance will be used only as part of the Responsibility Determination - it is NOT an evaluation factor, and will not be taken into consideration in determining technical acceptability. It is to be used after the potential winning offeror has been chosen based upon the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable criteria. As part of the Responsibility Determination, past performance will be evaluated IAW FAR 9.1. In addition to the references provided by each offeror, past performance information may be obtained through Government contractor performance record systems. <br />Additional Required Information<br />1.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-99-H-5004-0013 . <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

This plan provides a basis for the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to evaluate the quality of the Contractor's performance.  The oversight provided for in the contract and in this plan shall ensure service levels reach and maintain the required levels throughout the contract term.  This plan shall provide the COR with a proactive way to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance, and provide verifiable input for the required annual past performance evaluations.  <BR>1. PURPOSE.<BR>This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) provides a systematic method to evaluate performance for the stated contract.  This QASP explains the following:<BR>"	What will be monitored.<BR>"	How monitoring will take place.<BR>"	Who will conduct the monitoring.<BR>"	How monitoring efforts and results will be documented.<BR>This QASP does not detail how the contractor accomplishes the work.  Rather, the QASP is created with the premise that the contractor is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  It is the Governments responsibility to be objective, fair, and consistent in evaluating performance.  In addition, the QASP should recognize that unforeseen and uncontrollable situations may occur. <BR>This QASP is a living document and the Government may review and revise it on a regular basis.  However, the Government shall coordinate changes with the contractor.  Updates shall ensure that the QASP remains a valid, useful, and enforceable document.  Copies of the original QASP and revisions shall be provided to the contractor and Government officials implementing surveillance activities.<BR>2. GOVERNMENT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.<BR>The following personnel shall oversee and coordinate surveillance activities.  <BR>a. Contracting Officer (KO) - The KO shall ensure performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensure compliance with the contract terms, and shall safeguard the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship.  The KO shall also assure that the contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under this contract. The KO is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the contractors performance.<BR>b. Contracting Officers Representative (COR) - The COR is responsible for technical administration of the contract and shall assure proper Government surveillance of the contractors performance. The COR shall keep a quality assurance file.  At the conclusion of the contract or when requested by the KO, the COR shall provide documentation to the KO.  The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Governments behalf.  The contractor shall refer any changes they deem may affect contract price, terms, or conditions to the KO for action.<BR>3. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.<BR>Performance Requirements Summary<BR>Critical Task	Standard 	Metric	Surveillance Method	Incentives/De-Incentives<BR>1. The contractor shall provide services IAW  PWS Paras:<BR>3.1; and 5., and 9.	Ensure the services are fully accomplished.	100% of the time.

The contractor shall adhere to work schedule IAW PWS<BR>Para 8., and 10.<BR>	Ensure itemized list of services are provided.	100% of the time.	Periodic Inspection 	(1) Require Re[performance of the service if applicable. <BR><BR>(2)  Contract Deficiency Report (CDR)<BR>Performance standards define desired services.  The Government performs surveillance to determine if the contractor exceeds, meets or does not meet these standards.  The Government shall use the performance Work Statement to determine contractor performance and shall compare contractor performance to the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL). <BR>4. METHODS OF QA SURVEILLANCE. <BR>Various methods exist to monitor performance.  The COR shall use the surveillance methods listed below in the administration of this QASP. <BR>Regardless of the surveillance method, the COR shall always contact the contractor's task manager or on-site representative when a defect is identified and inform the manager of the specifics of the problem.  The COR, with assistance from the KO, shall be responsible for monitoring the contractors performance in meeting a specific performance standard/AQL.<BR><BR>a. DIRECT OBSERVATION.  (Can be performed periodically or through 100% surveillance.)  <BR>b. PERIODIC INSPECTION.  Inspections may be scheduled [Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, or annually] or unscheduled, as required.)<BR>5. DOCUMENTING PERFORMANCE.  <BR>a.  ACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE.  The Government shall document positive performance.  A report template is attached.  Any report may become a part of the supporting documentation for fixed fee payments, award fee payments, or other actions. <BR>b.  UNACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE.  When unacceptable performance occurs, the COR shall inform the contractor.  This will normally be in writing unless circumstances necessitate verbal communication.  In any case the COR shall document the discussion and place it in the COR file.  <BR>When the COR determines formal written communication is required, the COR shall prepare a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR), and present it to the contractor's task manager or on-site representative.  A CDR template is attached to this QASP.  <BR>The contractor shall acknowledge receipt of the CDR in writing.  The CDR will specify if the contractor is required to prepare a corrective action plan to document how the contractor shall correct the unacceptable performance and avoid a recurrence.  The CDR will also state how long after receipt the contractor has to present this corrective action plan to the COR.  The Government shall review the contractor's corrective action plan to determine acceptability. <BR>Any CDRs may become a part of the supporting documentation for contract payment deductions, fixed fee deductions, award fee nonpayment, or other actions deemed necessary by the KO. <BR>6. FREQUENCY OF MEASUREMENT.<BR><BR>While the contractor is fully expected to comply with all requirements in the PWS, the governments assessment of contractor performance will focus mainly on the objectives listed in the AQL column of the Performance Standards Summary.  The COR will monitor the contractors performance to ensure it meets the standards of the contract.  Unacceptable performance may result in the Contracting Officer taking any of the following actions:  Require the contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements, reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services, issue a Contract Discrepancy Report, or require the contractor to re-perform the service.  In addition, the contractors performance will be recorded annually in the Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR).<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.  

Solicitation number #XW001-XW997 is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).  As a result of this solicitation, GSA anticipates award of a fixed-price purchase order for all but elements 5 and 8 of the statement of work below.  These tasks will likely be awarded on a time-and-materials basis.  This acquisition is a total set-aside for small businesses.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 Environmental Consulting Services and the applicable size standard is $7 million.

Executive Order (EO) 13514 requires every agency to develop greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets for both their direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2 and 3) emissions.  Partnering with DOE and EPA, GSA intends to lead the Federal Governments development of training and assessment teams that will assist the agencies in establishing GHG reduction targets and establishing implementation plans. These teams will act as force multipliers across GSA, EPA, OPM, Treasury, DOE, and will become key enablers in our compliance with the Executive Order.  

Since this task order will require emissions expertise in a number of specialized areas (buildings, transportation, other resource flows), GSA encourages the use of subcontractors, as necessary, in order to provide the best technical solution possible.  Any subcontracting performed under this task order must be performed within the limits of clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting.

Statement of Work:

GSA requires a Contractor to facilitate this effort by performing the following tasks (completion deadlines in parentheses):

1. Demonstrate thorough knowledge of Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, and EISA 07/EO 13514 by providing a summary report of these GHG requirements and a proposed agenda for meeting with agency personnel. (6 April 2010)

2. Meet with stakeholders and subject matter experts from OPM, Treasury, EPA, GSA and possibly DOE for an initial assessment. GSA will provide basic data on each agency (gross square footage, number of people, number of facilities, number of locations, size and makeup of any fleet assets, budget number and any breakdown that might be required for analysis  to be provided later). (8-21 April 2010)

3. During the assessment, identify each of the above-listed agencys challenges and opportunities as they pertain to GHG reduction targets and implementation plans. Submit this summary in a report and along with a proposed agenda for the 2-3 day workshop (see element 5 below). (22 April 2010)

4. Provide GSA with the list of proposed attendees and dates for the workshop for approval. (23 April 2010)

5. Conduct a 2-or 3-day GHG Reduction Workshop to educate 30-50 personnel from the above-listed agencies.  The Workshop shall consist of a series of presentations on best practices and advanced techniques for reducing GHG emissions. The remaining time shall consist of working groups that mix agency personnel to devise innovative solutions to setting and meeting GHG emission reduction targets. (approx. 28 April 2010)

6. Using data and feedback collected during the agency visits and the workshop, assess the high-level costs and potential reductions from a broad spectrum of possible actions. Develop an integrated GHG reduction approach that strategically addresses all scopes of emissions. Present this approach in report format and/or software (if applicable) to each pilot agency - GSA, EPA, OPM, and Treasury. Also, the Contractor shall provide an executive summary report on significant findings, recommendations and opportunities for synergies across all agencies to the Director of the Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings at GSA. (11 May 2010)

7. Provide an education plan to GSA for use in teaching GSA and other agency personnel how to: assess the challenges and opportunities within their organization, develop reasonable GHG reduction goals for their organizations, and design implementation plans to achieve the stated reduction targets. Other elements may be included in the education plan as applicable. (18 May 2010)

8. Provide ongoing consultation services (locations, timing, and duration to be determined) to OPM, Treasury, EPA, GSA, and possibly DOE, on the integrated approach, including iterative LCA and packaging of opportunities, to optimize GHG emission reductions. Suggest a suite of measures and timing for the agencies that will set the priorities for those agencies to meet their reduction targets. (beginning 18 May 2010 and ending no later than 30 September 2010)

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-35.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only full and open competition solicitation. This synopsis, NAICS code 811219, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. Any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government. The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote. Meeting the technical requirement is significantly more important than the cost.</p>
<p>This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for a service agreement for multiple Bio-Plex pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW)</p>
<p>The Division of Microbiology in the Office of Regulatory Science has four Bio-Plex 200 systems manufactured by Bio-Rad. We need to maintain annual service agreements on these instruments. Annual preventive maintenance is critical to the continued functioning of these precision instruments as is the ability to have a service engineer physically on site in the case of major instrument failure. Because this instrument uses a flow cytometer and lasers to detect the sample, repairs can be costly without a service contract. Additionally, in the case of PC failure and/or replacement, we need a service engineer that is able to reinstall Bio-Rad's proprietary Bio-Plex software.</p>
<p>We need four Bio-Plex 200 instruments to be serviced annually by a company that will not void any remaining Bio-Rad warranty from the original purchase of the equipment. The service agreement needs to include the following items during its covered service agreement period:<br />1. unlimited on-site repair visits, including parts, labor, and travel expenses. <br />2. one preventive maintenance visit; and<br />3. re-installation of Bio-Rad provided software and PC re-configuration in the event of PC repair or replacement.</p>
<p>All service requests must be answered by the contractor either via email or telephone within 24 hours. The the service request requires that the contractor come to the FDA facility, a call from the contractor must be made within 24 hours to arrange the service on site. The service will take place on a weekday.</p>
<p><br />The maintenance agreement shall cover the following four instruments: <br />CLIN0001: BioPlex 200 Array Reader Serial#LX10008003403<br />CLIN0002: BioPlex 200 Array Reader Serial#LX10009024401<br />CLIN0003: BioPlex 200 Array Reader Serial#LX10009140404<br />CLIN0004: BioPlex 200 Array Reader Serial#LX10009139404</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>Please provide a quote for each of the annual timeframes below. The quote should include the cost to cover all four (4) instruments in the same year.</p>
<p>Base Year: 05/01/10 - 04/30/11<br />Option Year 1: 05/01/11 - 04/30/12<br />Option Year 2: 05/01/12 - 04/30/13<br />Option Year 3: 05/01/13 - 04/30/14<br />Option Year 4: 05/01/14 - 04/30/15</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>1. The contractor shall demonstrate the capability to provide unlimited on-site repair visits including parts, labor, and travel expenses. <br />2. The contract shall demonstrate the capability to provide one preventive maintenance visit for each annual timeframe above. <br />3.

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR) (FEB 2005)<br /><br />a. Jamie LeCompte is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The COTR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the Contractor by a unilateral modification to the Contract. The COTR is located at: 1050 Register Street, Charleston, SC 29405-2421.</p>
<p>b. The responsibilities and limitations of the COTR are as follows:<br />(1) The COTR is responsible for the technical aspects of the project and serves as technical liaison with the Contractor. The COTR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all reports, and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract.<br />(2) The COTR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the Contract price, terms or conditions. Any Contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COTR. No such changes shall be made without the expressed prior authorization of the Contracting Officer (CO). The CO may designate assistant or alternate COTR(s) to act for the COTR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the Contractor. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR<br />SHIP REPAIR (AUGUST 2005)</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule, as follows:</p>
<p>A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be reduced by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar work items.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.232-25 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>
<p>Name and Address of the contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />CLIN/Work Item No., Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>The invoice must include:</p>
<p>a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Ship name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.</p>
<p>Note: When invoicing for growth work, the contractor shall identify it as Growth and shall identify the modification number to which authorization was given and the CLIN/work item that the growth is associated.</p>
<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.</p>
<p>All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration provided all supporting documentation is submitted and validated.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:</p>
<p>Department of Commerce/NOAA<br />Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD)<br />Attn: Robin Resweber<br />200 Granby Street, 8th Floor<br />Norfolk, VA 23510<br />Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER EA133M-10-SU-XXXX (to be assigned upon contract award). &#61618;</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)<br /><br />The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0002) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for this Dockside Availability are listed in Section B. <br /><br />b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:</p>
<p>1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in <br />direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.<br /><br />2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.</p>
<p>3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.</p>
<p>c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0003). The estimated worth of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.</p>
<p>d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.<br /><br />e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0002) and additional material (CLIN 0003) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.<br />FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (FEB 2010) applies, and the following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause at paragraph (b) are applicable to this acquisition:<br />(8) 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003) (15 U.S.C. 644).<br />(18) 52.219-28, Post Award Small Business Program Representation (Apr 2009) (15 U.S.C. 632(a)(2)).<br />(19) 52.222-3, Convict Labor (June 2003) (E.O. 11755).<br />(20) 52.222-19, Child Labor-Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (Aug 2009) (E.O. 13126).<br />(21) 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (Feb 1999).<br />(22) 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (Mar 2007) (E.O. 11246).<br />(31) 52.225-1, Buy American Act-Supplies (Feb 2009) (41 U.S.C. 10a-10d).<br />(34) 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases (June 2008) (E.O.'s, proclamations, and statutes administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury).<br />(39) 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) (31 U.S.C. 3332).</p>

<p><br />Statement of Work/Specifications for Inspect/Repair of WP-3D Propeller</p>
<p>A.1 Introduction:</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), MacDill AFB, Florida, intends to inspect and repair as necessary, repack the dome assembly and bench test for return to service propeller Part Number 54H60-77 Propeller Assembly, Serial Number N235504NR.</p>
<p>A.2 Background:</p>
<p>The propeller has been removed from the #4 position of WP-3D aircraft tail number N43RF located at the AOC, MacDill AFB, Florida. The propeller will be shipped minus the propeller control on a propeller transportation stand provided by the Aircraft Operations Center. The propeller was removed for leaking blade butt seals. TSO is 2723.3 hours, TSN is 5978.6 hours.</p>
<p>A.3 Scope:<br /><br />Contract to be accomplished in four parts: <br />&bull; One: Prospective contractors shall provide a quote for teardown and inspection of the above listed propeller and provide a "worst case" quote to repair the propeller.<br />&bull; Two: The selected contractor will provide within seven (7) working days of receipt of the above propeller, a report to the Contracting Officer (CO), of parts and labor, including the accomplishment of any outstanding Propeller Repair Bulletins (PRB), required to return the assembly to a serviceable, ready for installation condition and recommendations of the most cost effective and advantageous means to accomplish the work. <br />&bull; Three: The teardown report and recommendations of the selected contractor will be reviewed by the CO and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). Upon completion of the review, the CO shall provide instructions to the selected contractor on how to proceed with the work. <br />&bull; Four: Upon receipt of the instructions from the CO, the selected contractor shall provide all necessary special tools, labor, and parts to perform the requested work on the propeller assembly. If any additional discrepancies outside of normal repair criteria, are discovered during performance of the work, the selected contractor shall immediately stop work and notify the COTR of the additional discrepancies, to include any parts required, labor required and cost estimate for the additional work. This work will be considered as "over-and-above" costs. The selected contractor will not proceed with the additional work until approval for the additional work is received from the CO. The selected contractor shall accomplish all of the work in accordance with manufacturer's repair/overhaul manuals and applicable repair station procedures. The selected contractor shall bench test the assembly for proper performance parameters within the manufacturer's limits. The propeller will be returned to the Aircraft Operations Center on the same transportation stand provided at delivery. <br /><br />A.4 Technical Requirements:</p>
<p>The selected contractor must be a certified FAA Repair Station and/or Authorized Hamilton Sundstrand Service Center covering 54H60-77 propeller type. The selected contractor must have performed and provide written proof of an Inspection and Repair as Necessary (IRAN), major repair or overhaul on this propeller type within the last 30 calendar days. Upon return to service of the assembly, the contractor shall provide all the proper documentation (i.e., FAA 8130 or equivalent and FAA 337 if required) and make the required entries into the propeller logbook provided with the propeller.</p>
<p>A.5 Parts, Discounts, and Warranties:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous, at any time during the contract. The Government will make the final determination on whether new, overhauled, or serviceable parts will be installed in the assemblies. Parts or components in an "as removed" condition will not be installed in the assemblies. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an "over-and-above." The Contractor shall provide the AOC with a warranty providing a minimum of one hundred hours flight time or six (6) months from time of installation of the propeller.</p>
<p>A.6 Period of Performance:<br /><br />Due to mission requirements and the limited number of spares possessed by the AOC, the turn-around time shall not exceed 30 working days from the date of award. Should abnormal requirements and/or circumstances occur which would require an extension of this performance period, the selected contractor should immediately provide documentation to the CO as to the reason and extent of the abnormal requirements and/or circumstances. The selected contractor shall also provide the best estimate of the extension required.</p>
<p><br />A.7 Insurance against Loss or Damage to Government Property:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the performance of this work a minimum of $150,000 of insurance. The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective:</p>
<p>a.) For such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe; or</p>
<p>b.) Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever period is longer.</p>
<p>A.8 Evaluation of Offer:<br /><br />The Government will evaluate the offers for award purposes on the basis of the criteria listed in paragraph B.1 herein.<br /><br />A.9 Delivery Requirements:</p>
<p>The cost of shipping the propeller to the selected contractor facility shall be the responsibility of the Government. Shipping to return the propeller to the AOC shall be the responsibility of the contractor. Return shipping costs should be included in the contractor proposal.</p>
<p>A.10 Submittal of Invoices: (EAD-KC Addendum to FAR 52.212-4(g))</p>
<p>The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) using the address shown in Block 15 of the Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items-Standard Form 1449. All invoices shall be based on work completed as of the end of the Contractor's most recent billing period and shall be submitted to AOC by the 10th day of the subsequent month.</p>
<p>A.11 Over and Above Items: The Contractor is responsible for documenting and reporting to the COR/AOC Point of Contact, all discrepancies found during the inspection. Discrepancies that are not a part of the inspection will be known as "over and above." Corrective actions as a result of the inspection are considered "over and above" items. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life, but fails inspection and needs to be replaced, is considered an "over and above" item.</p>
<p>"Over and Above" discrepancy report must include (as a minimum):<br />- Description of each discrepancy found;<br />- Number of person-hours per discipline required to complete each discrepancy;<br />- Hourly rate for personnel performing the work;<br />- Parts cost less the percentage discount, if any;<br />- Total dollar amount for the complete list of discrepancies.</p>
<p>The COR/AOC Contact Point will be responsible for reviewing the list of "over and above" discrepancies and making a recommendation to the CO, to either accept or decline the Contractor's proposal. The Contractor shall not proceed with correcting any "over and above" discrepancies without prior approval from the CO. The Contractor shall bill all charges for "over and above" items on a separate invoice at the conclusion of repairs.</p>
<p>Funds for the "over and above" items will be specified at the time of award and included in the Line Item Number 0003. The dollar amount stated in the contract represents an estimated total, not to exceed amount to cover charges for the "over and above". The Government will pay invoices for "over and above "services out of the funds allocated and authorized on Line Item Number 0003. This paragraph applies only to Line Item Number 0003. It is not possible prior to contract award to accurately estimate the extent and duration of work or to anticipate costs for Line Item Number 0003 with any reasonable degree of confidence. Time and materials provide for acquiring these services on the basis of direct labor hours and cost of materials.</p>
<p>Direct labor hours are at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit. Cost of materials includes appropriate material handling cost as part of material costs. The price to be paid for material shall be based on an established catalog or list price in effect when material or other product is furnished, less all applicable discounts to the Government. In no event shall the price exceed the Contractor's sales price to its most favored customer for the same item in like quantity, or the current market price, whichever is lower.</p>
<p>B.1 Evaluation Criteria: <br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to evaluate offers.</p>
<p>Factor A - Technical <br />1. Must provide written documentation of having accomplished major repair, IRAN, and/or overhaul of the 54H60-77 model propeller assembly within the past 30 days.<br />2. Must submit a copy of FAA Repair Station Certificate, and/or proof of Hamilton Sundstrand Authorized Maintenance Center documentation.<br />3. The ability to perform the work requested within the performance period of A.6. <br />4. Must submit Proof of Insurance documentation as described in paragraph A.7.<br />5. The Contractor's facility must be located within the USA.<br />6. Provide documentation of factory trained, A&amp;P technicians on staff.</p>
<p>Factor B - Past Performance<br />1. Past performance with a previous government contract. Provide a list of no more than three contacts including phone numbers, of firms to whom the offeror has successfully provided equipment or services that are the same or equal to that of this requirement.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance when combined, are slightly more important than price. As the technical ratings become more equal, price becomes more important. Conversely, as price proposals become more equal to one another, technical proposals will become a more important determining factor. NOAA will evaluate the offeror's proposed prices for fairness and reasonableness in relation to the solicitation's requirements. Overall, the proposal selected will be the one that provides the best value to the Government.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />1900 Half St., S.W. (JR11-0203)<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-372-3692<br />Fax: 202-475-3904</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p><br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 9 April 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 12 April 2010. Contact Ryan Suchy at 252-334-5472 or ryan.m.suchy@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Technical Capability Factor - The Government will evaluate how well each proposal documents an in-depth understanding of the Marine Corps' process and procedures for locating maternal relatives of Marines unaccounted for from past conflicts. Offerors will be evaluated on their experience/depth of program knowledge in Department of Defense (DoD) policy for locating maternal relatives who are eligible mitochondrial Family Reference Sample donors and requisite skills in successfully locating family members of Marines unaccounted for from past conflicts.

3.  Price - The sum of all the CLINs for the base plus option periods shall represent the total price to the Government. The government will compare the proposed firm fixed prices to establish price fairness and reasonableness. Proposed will be evaluated for completeness.
The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

A written notice of award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
Note: Technical capability is more important than past performance, when combined, technical capability and past performance, are significantly more important than price.

A technically superior proposal that is offered at a greatly excessive price may be determined not to represent the best value to the government.

<DESC>****************************************************************************<br />Questions and Answers Modification #1<br /><br />(Q) Can you state what the cables and wiring would be used for?&nbsp;<br />(A) The cables and adapters will be used to interconnect microwave equipment operating between 1.7-8.5GHz<br /><br />(Q) &nbsp;Please clarify which male connector is called out on the three items below:<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 24"<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 36"<br />200 (ea) RF Cable SMA Male to Male RG-142 48"<br /><br />(A) All will be SMA Male to SMA Male RG-142 in 24, 36, 48 inches<br /><br />(Q) No RF specifications are called out. Parts such as N and SMA connectors come in several grades. &nbsp;One is a low grade good to a few GHz, then comes the standard grade good to 12 GHz, and then there is the high precision grade good to 18GHz. &nbsp;There is a big price difference between them. Based on the cables called out you are interested in the "standard" grade, but there are lots of vendors that will quote the lower grade. &nbsp;The same goes for the SMA 90 Degree, there is a sharp version good to 6GHz and then the radius bend good to 18 GHz<br /><br />(A) The FBI is seeking RF connectors and adapters in the standard grade, good to 12Ghz brass construction. &nbsp;As for the 90 degree SMA adapters, the FBI will accept the sharp turn type.<br /><br />(Q) &nbsp;The enduser might want to consider using RG400 instead of RG-142, the electrical specifications are the same. &nbsp;The difference is that RG400 has a stranded center conductor while RG-142 has a single silver plated steel center conductor. &nbsp;The benefit is increased flexibility.<br /><br />(A) The FBI is satisfied with the RG-142 type cable. &nbsp;The extra flexibility RG-400 gives is not critical nor significant.<br /><br />(Q) We don't think any vendor can supply all of these parts in 30 days. More realistic would be 1/2 in 30 days and all in 60 days.<br /><br />(A) &nbsp;The delivery time will be 60 days ARO (after receipt of order) with partial shipments accepted.<br />&nbsp;

<CONTACT>Moe FILALI, Purchasing Agent, Phone 2023724071, Fax 202-372-4905, Email Mohamed.Filali@USCG.Mil
<DESC><br />DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Coast Guard intends to purchase "Open Secret Space Cabling" project/services for the Coast Guard. This Open Secret Space SIPRNET Infrastructure project should include 50 Quad STP Data Jacks and 3 Quad Fiber Optic Data Jacks as per attached schedule under Statement of Work. <br />This distance is approximately 250 feet. All other drops will be shorter as we proceed closer to the main distribution room. The layout of the drops can only be determined once ceiling tiles are opened and location decisions made after surveying best routing of data cables. The CG is flexible with determining final locations of all data drops.<br /><br />Additional Notes: <br />- No PDS is needed, but a cable tray support system is required<br />- No unclassified cabling will be installed per this SOW. It is possible the handling of some unclassified cabling will be required during installation of cable tray and/or STP/Fiber cables.<br />- It is possible for the crossing of JWICS, SIPRNET and NIPRNET cables to occur at differenct areas of project. So long as the TEMPEST requirements are met and adhered to this will not be an issue.<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Quad fiber optic WAO will need a dual gang box and face plate. <br />- The 3 quads fiber WAO, and the CAT6 STP will be of the same classification and can be installed in the same cable tray.<br />- The SMDR does not currently have the proper plywood backing for mounting hardware.<br />The plywood need to be 3/4inch thick fire rated plywood painted. These requirements will have to be met as they are all part of the FIPS EIA/TIA standards.<br />-Approxitmately, 30-50 STP/Fiber cables will need to be demo'ed after new installation is in place and cutover has occurred.<br />-Fiber WAO's will be terminated on double gang for each quad fiber optic cable. STP WAO's will be terminated with 4 CAT 6 STP cables on a single gang face plate.<br />- Secret clearance is required<br />- We would expect the contractor to install the labeled patch cables both fiber and copper. This will be a coordinated effort between the contractor and the customer during cutover period. <br />- - The fiber cable will be for MMF 62.5/125 and terminated with ST connectors. The CAT6 will be for a GIG network.<br />- All fiber connectors will be of the ST type.<br />- Fiber patch cables will need to be ST or ST: the fiber patch panels will need to interface ST to ST<br /><br />
<p>The total count for the copper STP CAT6 cables is 200 (50 WAO X 4 cables each = 200)</p>
<p>On the fiber count we need a total of 12 strands (3 WAO X 4 strands each = 12)</p>
<p>This is a correction to what the SOW indicates. On the SOW it specifies 24 strands of fiber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.</p>
<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>Hydraulic System Auxiliary Pump RFI Addendum 30 March 2010<br />Concerns voiced by industry have driven more description to the RFI dated 16 Mar 2010.<br />Power constraints for the AC:<br />&bull; The APU drives a 25 KVA 3 phase 115 vac generator that supplies 217 amps to the A/C for ground use<br />&bull; A/C power cart supplies 72 KVA 3 phase 115 vac for ground use
<p>Hydraulic constraints for AC:</p>
<p>&bull; Mule provide 3000 PSI to one stage of hydraulics at 22 GPM<br />&bull; Aux Hydraulic pumps provide 0.76 GPM</p>
<p>Provide options that fit within the constraints of the KC-135 aircraft. First option would comprise of using APU power distribution without removing current hydraulic architecture. Second option would use the KC-135 power cart for power distribution without removing current hydraulic architecture. Third option would allow for innovation by industry, meaning within the constraints of the KC-135 and keeping the current AC and DC hydraulic pump configuration, what is the maximum allowable capability industry has to offer to the government.</p>

As such, no "trade off" applies and the Government intends to award to the low priced firm who is compliant with terms of the solicitation, and deemed "technically acceptable." There will be no re-submittals for PDM and only firms with satisfactory or better PDMs will be eligible for award. Technical Acceptability is being defined herein as satisfactory, very good or exceptional PDMs. All PDMs will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria outlined in the solicitation. From among technically acceptable firms, the Government will then select the lowest price offeror and determine if that firm is responsible, complies with terms and conditions of the solicitation and an award to them is in the best interest of the Government. If that firm fits these criteria, award will be made to them. If not, the Government will review each subsequent technically acceptable low priced offer until one is identified that does meet the criteria, in which case award will be made to that firm. The Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with a competitive range group of offerors from among technically acceptable firms, based on price. If negotiations are conducted, award will be made to low priced offer (based on final proposal revision closing, date/time) that is technically acceptable, responsible and compliant with solicitation terms and conditions.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in St. Peters (St. Charles County), Missouri, that will be expiring.  USDA is seeking to lease approximately 3955 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 3755 square feet of contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area (ABOA).  The lease term requirement is for 5 years.  The space must be available for occupancy by June 1, 2010.  The delineated area is North  I-70, East  Caves Springs Road to Muegge Road to Highway 94, South  Highway 94,  West  Salt Lick road to Birdie Hills Road to Knaust Road to Weiss Road to Hwy N to Mid Rivers Mall Drive; as well as within the city limits of St. Charles, MO.

Other applicable requirements include:

	Parking -24 hard surface for customers and official Government vehicles with adequate pull-through to accommodate agricultural related trucks and trailers.
	Security 

The USDA is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The USDA will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the USDA will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the USDAs requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

	Rentable square feet available and expected rental rate per rentable square foot, fully serviced.

	Building ownership information.
	Amount of parking available on-site and its cost.  Include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking, if any.

Accordingly, the TSA intends to award a contract to AOC Solutions located at 14151 Newbrook Drive, Suite 200, Chantilly, Virginia 20151. This contract will address the requirements of the TSA Office of Finance and Administration in complying with prescribed accounting standards and external oversight. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The Office of Finance and Administration (OFA) is currently rescoping their requirements that will be recompeted during this fiscal year. This sole source procurement action will allow the OFA to continue receiving the support services it needs to continue to make financial progress on reconciling TSA's financial statements until the new contract is awarded. The base period is anticipated to be from June 1, 2010 through October 15, 2010, to allow time for the new contract to be awarded. An optional period is anticipated to be from October 16, 2010 through January 31, 2011, to allow for transition.<br /><br />Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above named company directly.</p>

<DESC>Patient Parking Garage549-900RFI AnswersLast updated 30 March 20101.  We respectfully request site utilities plans and drawings for the existing Parking Lot 6 and adjacent areas.  AutoCAD files could be made available to successful bidder upon bid award.See embedded files.  The VA Cond Ret System.pdf shows the abandoned steam line.   2.  We respectfully request a complete set of "as-built" plans and drawings for Bldg 76.Sorry, these don't exist.3.  We respectfully request a complete description of VA Campus Central Fire Alarm System and location of the VA Campus Central Fire Alarm system Control Center in relation to the proposed parking garage building.The system currently in use is Siemens MXL.  The tie in point is in Bldg 13.  We have a project coming to change the entire system out to Notifier but you should plan on installing Siemens as we don't have a date on the Notifier system.4.  We respectfully request a description and location of the available electrical power supply to feed the proposed parking garage building.a.  15kV duct bank at south side of Bldg 9 at the west end (put in when the conference room you met in for the pre-bid was added)b.  15kV duct bank at south side of Bldg 7 in the drive.c.  We don't know the condition and if the abandoned high voltage bus duct (see embedded file) would line up to serve for the new parking facility.  However, we used abandoned bus duct for another project and proved to save money. d.  It may prove to be  a better all around solution to come from Bldg 13, motor pool, than from the 15kV duct bank with a new transformer/service. We don't see too much of a demand from a garage. NEC has the load as  watt/ft plus motors.  If we do come from Bldg 13, the distribution board will need to be upgraded/replaced. We can even supply emergency power from there. There should be ample capacity since the old boiler plant (not in use) is fed from Bldg 13.5.  Has the VA performed test borings on Parking Lot 6?  Can you furnish the results?Yes, see embedded file.  This test was done in 2002. 6.  Please provide more direction on the finish required such as type, amount of brick, amount of glass, and whether or not thin-set brick will be allowed.Preferred design opportunities include, but are not limited to, the following:o	The use of brick, masonry, or patterned precast concrete veneer is suggested as an architectural material palette.  Alternative "masonry" materials may be considered as acceptable.  Final design is to be submitted by the successful bidder and approved by the VA.o	The use of other materials, such as metal panels or glass, that complement the existing palette while creating a new contemporary aesthetic along the southern portion of campus are allowable.o	The use of glazing at the stairs and elevators to enhance and clearly identify all vertical circulation points that face the primary building campus is required.7.  Does the structure need to be concrete?Yes.  Steel will not be accepted.  Structural system shall be either of the following:A.  Cast-in-place post-tension concrete frame and slab (preferred)B.  Pre-cast concrete frame(1)  Composite toping poured on site(2)  Pre-topped(3)  Post-tensioned slabs8.  Please provide a topo map.See embedded file. 9.  Please define access to the water tower.The current access gate is on the west side.  The contractor will need to relocate the access gate in order to expand the foot print of the garage up to the fence line.  It is up to the contractor to give their suggestion as part of the bid.  Some options are given on the embedded file. 10.  Where will the shuttle busses route past this garage?See third page of embedded file. 11.  Is PageSoutherlandPage excluded from partnering on this project?Yes, they cannot partner as they will be doing the peer review.12.  What is the specific timeline as far as project award/construction start?Award will be as soon as possible (within a couple of weeks) after the bids are due (26 April), with NTP to follow as soon as bonds are provided.  We expect design to start upon NTP, and construction to follow as detailed in the SOW.13.  Can you please clarify if the prime needs to actually conduct/submit a separate traffic study, or if the prime just needs to use the one already done by PSP?Use the one provided by PSP; that is why we provided it to you.14.  It is our understanding that there is not currently a soils report for this project, and that the VA is going to try and locate one from one of the existing buildings.   If one cannot be located, should the prime assume that the prime will be responsible for the soils report?See answer to question 5.  If the prime feels another one is needed, the prime will be responsible.15.  Is there a specific RFP submittal requirement in the solicitation other than Part I, Item I, Scope of Contract; this section does give some basic parameters.  Should we assume that the response needs to be formed in accordance with that section?  Yes.  Also, how many copies are to be submitted, three (3) and what binding type (3-hole punch vs. spiral bind) does the VA require?  Binding is your choice.16.  Are there other federal forms required to be submitted with the RFP other than what is required in Part I, Item 1, Scope of Contract?It depends upon the type of business venture you pursue -http://www4.va.gov/OSDBU/resources/documents.asp  IL 049-06-4- others may be required.17.  Could you tell me if there is a signage package for the new parking garage - project 549-900? Adcon Signs would be very interested in looking at and bidding the signage needs. Thanks, Nate Zimmerman 970.472.2121.Signage will be needed.  The specifics will be designed during the design part of the design-build process.  You would need to communicate your desire to the general contractor winning the bid.18.  Does the joint venture need to be registered on the above websites or only the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business?Please review the website:  http://www4.va.gov/OSDBU/resources/documents.asp  IL049-06-419.  Permitting:  Will this project require a site development permit and/or building permit?  If so, has the timing of the permitting been considered in the project timeline of 240 days?No, the construction will take place on federal property where a building permit is not needed.  That brings up the opportunity to point out another item:  Utility locators will not come onto the property for free (since it is federal) to do utility location so you will have to hire a locator as a subcontractor.20.  Part III - Schedule Objectives, page 64:  Is the 240 calendar day schedule inclusive of the 90 calendar days for design; or over and beyond, which would bring the total schedule duration to 330 calendar days?Inclusivegrand total:  240 calendar days.21.  Will it be a requirement to have City of Dallas Permits?  If yes, does the 240 day schedule exclude the period of time documents are in permit review?See answer to question 19.22.  Pg. 62, Item #20 refers to a "roof" on the upper level.  Is it the intention of the VA to have covered parking spaces for the upper level? Yes.  Do drive aisles and other portions of the upper level of the structure have to be covered?  No.23.  Will PSP or the VA provide a narrative prior to the RFP submittal giving guidance on desired exterior enhancements to match campus theme or is that individually left to the respective design-build teams.See answer to question 6.24.  Due to the aggressive design-build schedule will the VA  entertain and accept an early 100% Civil/Foundation submittal set (without incremental 35% & 65% sets) to accommodate the aggressive schedule.Yes, however, if it is found to need changes or corrections then a follow-on submittal will be required at the cost of the contractor.25.  The existing Bldg# 76 to be re-used and relocated, is the relocation to be a shell structure only, i.e. no MEP services?  No, the new building will need to match what is currently there with the current building.  Therefore, the contractor will need to do a site investigation to figure this out.  At a minimum it is known that there is lighting (electrical) and the shell is insulated.  Will the foundations and/or slab be provided under a separate contract?  No, the SOW makes it clear that the new foundation and demo of the old are both included in the work.  Is the time required to take down and relocate in addition to the 240 days to construct the parking garage?  No, included in the 240 days.26.  In order to maintain access to the water tower during garage construction would a new curb cut be permitted on Ann Arbor Ave?  Yes.27.  Does the VA currently have a survey available for this site?  Can such be made available to all?See answer to question 8.28.  Can a Geotech investigation with borings be made available with regards to the site and or a project near this site?  Use to design foundation and establish pier depths.See answer to question 5.29.  Does the Dallas VA Hospital have any national purchase agreements in place that would affect the selection of any materials and or equipment?  Examples would be the elevators, parking controls, light fixtures, and or the electrical switch gear.  No.30.  Upon award, the design-build team shall meet with Page Southerland Page (PSP) and the VA resident engineer, for a planning meeting to coordinate the design, since this building will need to take advantage of the traffic study already done by PSP and will need to have a finish that will match future construction designed by PSP.  What does it mean will need to have a finish match etc?This quoted paragraph from the SOW was written before the traffic study was made available.  Since you have been provided the traffic study you will not need to wait for this meeting to obtain it.  As far as the finish goes, you have been provided enough direction in the answer to question 6 that you can put together an accurate proposal.31.  Fire alarm, compatible with and tied into campus fire alarm system - who or what is the existing alarm system?See answer to question 3.32.  Will there be a geotech survey available?See answer to question 5.33.  Will the site utility plans be available?See answer to question 1.34.  Will conceptual detail info from PSP for other projects be available to indentify exterior finishes to propose as a guideline in initial costs?See answer to question 6.35.  Please provide exact location existing storage building will be relocated?Behind Bldg 10.36.  Please provide a map layout as to where the proposed lay down area will be.See embedded file.  The lay down will be in the area west and north of the contractor parking. 37.  Page 63 of 72 notes LD's to be assessment to be base on schedule objectives (240 days). Is there a min/max ballpark cost for LD's?The VA has decided to not assess liquidated damages for this project.  However, if the chosen contractor doesn't hit the schedule, that will be a negative factor for them on the future parking garage projects.38.  It is noted that access to cooling tower must be available at all times. Is that pedestrian access or vehicle?  Vehicle.  If vehicle, what size and how often?  Large pick-up and/or small utility truck; once a week.  See also answer to question 9.39.  RFP notes minimum 400 parking spaces, it was noted that the project cost of $5M is the driving factor and that the cost takes precedence. Is this correct?Our application for the funds for this project has 400 minimum spaces in the narrative so we are bound to this.  The upper limit of the funds available for the project is $5M.  Therefore, both are necessary.  If not possible to meet both, we will not be able to go through with the project.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management has utilized blanket purchase agreeement L10PA00578 to award the subject requirement.  Below is a description of the requirement.
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Eastern States Office within the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) is the custodian of the original land title records that date back to the late 1700s.  These land title records were issued by the General Land Office (GLO) starting soon after the United States became a republic.  These include plats (drawings), field notes, patents (deeds), and tract books.  
The documents are of great historical value and are often the only source that offers the identification of legal land descriptions and the transfer of property ownership from the U.S. Government to private landowners.  In 1989, the GLO Automation Records Project (GLOARP) was established.
GLO Automation Records Process (GLOARS) currently uses Internet and imaging technologies to scan, index, and access the land title data and imaged copies of the documents.  This system is a collection of subsystems consisting of the Automated Records System (ARS), for Internet access, Document Conversion System (DCS), which captures the images and data from the physical land patents, Cadastral Survey System (CSS), which captures images and data from the physical survey plats and field notes and Land Status Records System (LSR), which captures images and data from electronic images of existing Land Status records.  GLOARS is a complete document management environment.
The Bureau of Land Management requires contractor support for the indexing and verification of scanned Control Document Index into a new component of GLOARS called the CDI Application.  This new application will be integrated with the current components in the support for the DCS, CSS, LSR, and ARS applications.  The contractor will be required to verify that the scanned images reflect what is in the CDI database and maybe required to index documents or images that have not been scanned or that the data does not exist.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management has made award of the subject requirement to Premier Data Services.  Below is a general description of the requirment.
Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, New Mexico BLM has been tasked with ensuring positional mapping accuracy of records and boundaries in support of renewable energy development.  The BLM has been compiling survey, title, and legal land description information to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and title information in support of parcel based display of geographic information.  This task order is to improve the accuracy of the depiction of the PLSS within GCDB.  Below is an outline of the tasks required to help accomplish this task.
The vendor shall complete GPS corner collection for 203 corners, import 1172 GPS coordinates into 1172 GCDB township files, complete regional adjustment of 638 township subset of the 1172 townships, complete FixAN on the 444 ARRA townships within the 638 townships.
Remonumentation of government corner positions is not allowed under this award.  Monuments shall be described as found and not rehabilitated.  The contractor will not use accessories to establish a corner position, but accessories may be used to verify that a monument is in the position of record.

Description:
RECOVERY-THIS POST AWARD NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABE ONLY TO GTSI, CORP. FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Pub.L. 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of issuance of Modification 0001 to existing Delivery Order TIRNO-09-K-00218 to fulfill the requirement for additional Millions of Instructions Per Second (MIPS) in order to upgrade the existing ASG software that the IRS currently owns.  TIRNO-09-K-00218 was competed in accordance with the procedures set forth in FAR Subpart 8.404 for use of General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules.  The contract was ultimately awarded to GTSI, Corp., a large business.  Modification 0001 was executed as a firm-fixed price action with a contract value less than the micro-purchase threshold.

Currently, the IRS uses ASG software as a means of Information Technology (IT) support, preventive and remedial maintenance.  Maintenance and support of this software is essential in order to avoid disruption to the daily processing of taxpayer information performed at the computing centers in support of the IRS modernization efforts.  No other software has been found that can replace the functionality of the ASG software.  Therefore, the IRS will increase the ASG software MIPS through the issuance of Modification 0001.

As such, a cost reimbursement type action is appropriate.</span>

Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM LCMC (RI) Rock Island, IL  61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a three (3) year firm fixed-price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with Nobles Manufacturing, Inc (Nobles), Saint Croix Falls, Wisconsin.  Award is projected for the 4th QTR 2009 and FY 2009 Army Working Capital Funds (AWCF) will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because this action does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.  <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  This requirement is for a total estimated quantity of 900 each, 7.62mm x 9ft Ammunition Chute, Nobles P/N 55316; 900 each Ammo Can Conversion Kit, Nobles P/N 55221; 900 each .50 Cal Ammunition Chute, Nobles P/N 55091 and associated spare down parts, End Use: M134 Minigun, M296, M3M and M3P guns, in support of various helicopter platforms to include the Kiowa OH-58D.  The total estimated dollar value of this procurement is $8,500,000.00.<br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements). <br/><br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  Procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because Nobles is the sole designer and manufacturer of the ammunition feed chutes and the ammunition can conversion kits, as a Government owned competitive technical data package (TDP) does not exist.  There is no other qualified hardware that can satisfy the Government's needs that reduces weight, decreases friction and improves reliability as does the Nobles hardware. Also, the Government's schedule requires the fielding and installation of ammunition feed chutes and ammunition can conversion kits starting in August 2009, and  no other contractor has the essential qualifications to meet the Government's requirements in a timely manner.  There would be significant delay and duplicated cost to qualify another source for this requirement.<br/><br/>Nobles has proven to have the technical expertise, facilities, and manufacturing experience necessary for this item.  It would take approximately 2 years to reverse engineer and re-qualify another source at an estimated cost of $1.0 million.  The anticipated production lead time for the ammunition feed chutes and ammunition can conversion kits is 2 months.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Based on the preceding, the cost to reverse engineer is not anticipated to be recovered through competition, nor can the Government afford any delay in fulfilling these requirements due to the combat essential nature of the 7.62mm x 9ft Chute, P/N 55316, Ammo Can Conversion Kit, P/N 55221 & .50 Cal Ammunition chute, P/N 55091, in support of the Kiowa Warrior Product Office.<br/>	<br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  This procurement action was synopsized in the FedBizOpps to alert interested contractors and subcontractors.<br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Actions to increase competition are not presently feasible for the following reasons:  1) It is possible that the dollar value of this procurement will be significantly less than $8,500,000; 2) the cost toCompetition will not increase because the cost to acquire the a TDP is estimated at $1,000,000; and 3) no funds are currently available to reverse engineer or otherwise acquire the TDP..  Finally, this procurement action is an IDIQ because the future requirements for this item are not certain.    Furthermore, iIt would take 2 years to reverse engineer these requirements, including all re-qualifications, and the Government is unable to predict what its requirements will be at that time..<br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market Research was conducted for the basic requirement in March 2009 by the Armed Scout Helicopter Project Office.  The market research included personal knowledge of similar products and contact with knowledgeable persons in Government and industry.  There are other manufacturers of similar products; however, it was determined that none of the alternative products met the weight and material requirements of the Kiowa OH-58D aircraft.  Due to the time it would take to qualify other hardware, it was concluded that it is unlikely that any other contractor would be capable of providing the required hardware within the required time frame.  Nobles is the only known responsive and responsible source that can provide the ammunition feed chutes and ammunition can conversion kits in a timely manner. <br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing. The notices required by FAR 5.201 will be released in FedBizOpps and any proposals received will get due consideration under the law.<br/>  <br/>10.  Other Factors:  Procurement History:<br/><br/>Contract Number W31P4Q-06-C-R190, modification number 381, to Science and Engineering Services, Inc. was used to procure the 12 ammunition feed chutes and ammunition can conversion kits for testing and evaluation.  Purchase order SESI #PO9P00783 was awarded on 6 February 2009 from SESI to Nobles at a firm-fixed price of $47,200 for 12 ammunition feed chutes and ammunition can conversion kits.  A sole source award of this contract was made to Nobles Manufacturing, Inc.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>11.

Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL 61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a purchase order with Insight Technology, Inc., Londonderry, New Hampshire.  Award is projected for FY09 and US appropriated funds (pseudo FMS) will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.  <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  2657 each AN/PEQ-2A and 252 each AN/PEQ-2.  These are non-NSN'd commercial items.  These items are also referred to as Infrared Target Pointer Illuminator Aiming Lights.  The estimated value is $2,321,936.00.  The proposed contract will not include an option provision.  <br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, as implemented by FAR 6.302 1.<br/><br/> <br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because the Government does not own the Technical Data Package (TDP).  The Government is currently attempting to obtain estimates for reverse engineering of each item (time and money) or the cost to procure the TDP from Insight.  As the funds to be utilized for this effort expire on 30 September 2009, this office estimates the average costs associated with reverse engineering to be approximately XXXX and XXXX months.  Funds are not available at this time to undertake this effort and the Government believes it would not be cost effective to spend money on items that are no longer utilized by US Forces and that are considered commercial items. The time associated with undertaking a reverse engineering effort is not acceptable to Foreign Military Sales customers.  <br/><br/>Insight developed the AN/PEQ-2 in 1995 which was later selected and utilized by the Navy.  The AN/PEQ-2A is 2nd generation which includes additional safety features. These are considered to be "terminal" items by the US Army. However, FMS customers still have requirements for the AN/PEQ-2 and 2A.<br/>  <br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  This procurement action was synopsized in the FedBizOpps to alert interested contractors and subcontractors.<br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  We have chosen not to pursue data rights because the commercially available items change so quickly.  Additionally, this is an interim fix to satisfy immediate requirements for FMS countries pending releasability of the US Army Standard AN/PEQ-15.  Insight Technology Inc. is the developer and sole producer of the AN/PEQ-2 and AN/PEQ-2A.  The U.S. Government does not own or have rights to Insight's TDP.  We are currently attempting to obtain estimates for reverse engineering of each item (time and money) or the cost to procure the TDP from Insight.  The average costs associated with reverse engineering is estimated at XXXX and XXXX months. <br/><br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market research was conducted in September 2009 by members of the Integrated Product Team.  Internet inquiries did not identify any alternate producers of the AN/PEQ-2 and AN/PEQ-2A.  Insight Technology is the developer and sole producer of the AN/PEQ-2 and AN/PEQ-2A.  This was also verified with SOCOM, the US Navy and PM Sensors and Lasers.<br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources: To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing. The notices required by FAR 5.201 have been published and any proposals received shall be considered.  <br/><br/>10.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br/>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br/><br/>1.  Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL 61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a three year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity, (IDIQ) contract for the Day/Night Sight (DNS) with Insight Technology, Inc., Manchester, NH.  Award is projected for 4th quarter FY09 and Production Funds (PAA) will be used.  The guaranteed minimum quantity will be 8,350 each and the maximum contract quantity will be 30,000 each.  An acquisition plan for the M320 Grenade Launcher, which includes the DNS, is in process and is currently in staffing for approval by PEO Soldier.  <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  This action is for the procurement of the Day/Night Sight, NSN 1010-01-564-0735, in support of the M320 Grenade Launcher.  The Day/Night Sight (DNS) is a Non-developmental Item (NDI) developed at the expense of Insight Technology. The DNS will be furnished to the M320 Grenade Launcher contractor, Heckler and Koch Defense (HKD) for integration.  The DNS is a major component of the M320 Grenade Launcher.  The M320 Grenade Launcher is a 40mm grenade launcher that will replace the present M203 series Grenade Launcher currently mounted on the M16/M4 series of rifles and carbines.  The estimated value of this action is $40,950,000.  The proposed contract will not include an option provision.  <br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only one Responsible Source as implemented by FAR 6.302 1.<br/><br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because Insight Technology is currently the only manufacturer that has a design that meets the requirements set forth in the M320 Grenade Launcher Capability Production Document (CDP).  Additionally, the Insight Technology design passed both the developmental and operational testing at Aberdeen Proving Ground and Ft. Bragg which was conducted from December 2005 through September 2007.  The DNS has been type classified standard for Army use.  Historical program cost data to test and qualify the current DNS was estimated at $4.0 million and five years.  The administrative lead time to qualify an alternate DNS would be XXX with an additional XXX months to allow for production. The time delays to determine an acceptable alternate DNS and receive deliveries would significantly impact the support and fielding of the M320 Grenade Launcher.  The immediate fielding requirements do not permit the time necessary to qualify a new producer, nor would such an action be in the best interest of the Government.<br/><br/>The Government does not own the technical data package (TDP).  The electronic sighting technology is proprietary to Insight Technology, Inc.  The engineering community does not recommend development of a competitive TDP, as this technology is prone to frequent changes due to rapid technology advancement.  Additionally, only this model sight is compatible with the fielded M320 Grenade Launchers.  The M320 Grenade Launcher, including DNS component, has been tested and evaluated and is being procured as a type classified standard configuration.  The version of the Insight DNS the Government is purchasing is specifically calibrated to be compatible with the M320 Grenade Launcher.  Any deviation from the tested and approved DNS would result in incompatibilities and require significant testing.  It would be uneconomical to invest and expend the funds and time to qualify additional sources.  Another version of the DNS would not be compatible with the HKD M320 Grenade Launcher.  Two physically unique versions would also be a detrimental impact on operator and maintenance training to include an increased burden on logistics and supportability.  The M320 Grenade Launcher and DNS are proprietary to HKD and Insight Technology, Inc. respectively. <br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  This procurement action was synopsized in the FedBizOpps to alert interested contractors and subcontractors.<br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  As stated in paragraph 5, the time associated with qualifying new producers for this procurement would be prohibitive, and would not support the First Unit Equipped of the M320 Grenade Launcher.  Since the sighting system, laser rangefinder and IR devices are rapidly changing technology with very short product life cycle; the USG has no plan to pursue a TDP for this DNS configuration.  However, the Program Manager for Sensors and Lasers is currently in the process of competitively selecting and qualifying a follow-on system to the DNS which will include production options to ensure the most competitive pricing.  <br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market research was conducted during October 2008 by ARDEC Engineering.  As stated in paragraph 5 above, the time constraints to qualify another source makes this option prohibitive.  Although the DNS and Laser rangefinder provides desirable day and night target engagement capabilities, the size and weight of the item has been an issue in the field.  A Soldier Enhancement Program initiative has been approved to integrate the capability of the laser rangefinder and DNS with an Infrared Pointer/Illuminator to reduce size and weight and also meet the objective requirements. The Program Manager for Sensors and Lasers is currently managing the effort to select and qualify the new system with anticipated completion in mid to late XXX.<br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing. The notices required by FAR 5.201 have been published and any proposals received shall be considered.  <br/><br/> <br/>10.

Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL 61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a sole source, firm fixed price single award with US Ordnance.  Award is projected for the 4th quarter and U.S. appropriated funds (pseudo FMS) will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.  <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  This procurement is for the purchase of 417 each of the US Ordnance (USO) Non-Standard Tripod Mount (in support of USO Non-Standard M2 Machine Gun) and a Contractor Spare Parts Package (CSP) to support the mounts. Each CSP package consists of the following and supports 10 mounts:<br/><br/>Handle with   - 13 Threaded Rod (X2)<br/>Spring Pin's 1/8 Dia. X   Long SS (X5)<br/>Spring Pin's 1/8 Dia. X   Long SS (X5)<br/>Set's arm serrated plate (X2)<br/>Screw and Nut for Leg Mount (X3)<br/>Lanyard and Detent Pin (X3)<br/>Right Leg (1)<br/>Left Leg (1)<br/>Center Leg (1)<br/>Slotted screw for serrated washer (X10)<br/>Nut body insert (X4)<br/>Clearance nut arm insert (X4)<br/><br/>The total estimated dollar value of this procurement is $736,746.43.  The proposed contract will not include an option provision.  <br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, as implemented by FAR 6.302 1.<br/><br/> <br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary as only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A procurement as listed herein is required to provide the requested items to supply the Afghanistan National Army (ANA) in accordance with signed Letter of Offer and Agreement (LOA).<br/><br/>a. The U.S. Army Standard M3 Tripod Mount, NSN 1005-00-322-9716, is used with the U.S. Army Standard .50 Caliber Machine Gun. Due to non-availability of the Army Standard .50 Caliber Machine Gun, ANA has procured the Non-Standard M2HB Machine Gun from US Ordnance.  A Non-Standard (commercial) Tripod Mount has been developed and is available from US Ordnance that is guaranteed by the contractor to be compatible with the Non-Standard M2 Machine Gun they are providing to the ANA.  The U.S. Government does not own the Technical Data Package for the Non-Standard Tripod Mount; it is proprietary to US Ordnance.  US Ordnance is the only known vendor that can adequately satisfy the ANA's immediate requirement for the Non-Standard Tripod Mount. <br/>  <br/>b. The current contractor for the Army Standard M3 Tripod Mounts cannot meet the required delivery schedule beginning December 2009.  The earliest delivery for the U.S. Army Standard M3 Tripod Mount is 2nd quarter FY12.  A competitive award of the U.S. Army Standard M3 Tripod would require a minimum of 120 days and would require first article testing.  Delivery could not occur in less than 286 days after award.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide the Army Standard M3 Tripod Mount on a delivery schedule compatible with the Non-Standard M2HB Machine Guns currently on contract for the ANA. The Non-Standard M3 Tripod Mount will fill the gap until the Standard M3 Tripod Mount is available in FY12.  The CSP's are needed for sustainment of the Non-Standard Tripod Mounts and to ensure interchangeability if a part was worn, lost, or destroyed.  In order to maintain the Non-Standard Tripod Mounts in the field, replacement/repair parts must be compatible.  As the Government does not have a competitive TDP for these parts, consequently they are also restricted to US Ordnance.  <br/>  <br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: The procurement action will be synopsized in FedBizOpps to alert interested contractors and subcontractors.  <br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  A competitive TDP exists for the Standard M3 Tripod Mount, and a competitive long term contract was awarded to Sigmatec Inc. in January 2008.  However, U.S. Army demand is significant and the current contractor, as of May 09 was behind in deliveries.  According to the most recent delivery schedule, the earliest possible delivery of this requirement would be January 2012.  Again, a competitive award of the U.S. Army Standard M3 Tripod would require a minimum of 120 days and would require first article testing.  Delivery could not occur in less than XXX days after award.  <br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market research was performed by the Security Assistance Management Directorate in September 2009.  Federal procurement history was searched for successful producers of .50 caliber machine guns and for successful producers of machine gun tripod mounts. Security Assistance personnel then conducted extensive internet searches for tripod machine gun mounts and reviews of internet sites for the identified manufacturers of both machine guns and other types of mounts. No manufacturer was found to assert that they produced a tripod mount that would work with the standard US Army M2 Machine gun. In fact, no other tripod mount for a .50 caliber machine gun was found.  Market research did not identify any other source of a Machine Gun Tripod Mount that would be interchangeable with the Standard M2 Machine Gun or the US Ordnance Non-Standard .50 caliber machine gun.  US Ordnance has asserted that their commercial non-standard tripod mount, produced for use with their commercial .50 caliber machine gun, will also work with the standard M2 .50 caliber machine gun produced by General Dynamics.  <br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing.  The notices required by FAR 5.201 will be published any proposals received shall be considered. <br/><br/>10.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-5
<AWDNBR>VA-249-10-RP-0105
<ARCHDATE>04112010
<DESC>The JHQ VAMC requires the professional services of a Radiation Physicist to be on-site a minimum of three (3) days per week, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, as well as to provide emergency radiation physicist services on call during non-working days, after work hours, and including federal holidays, as needed.  The Radiation Physicist/ Radiation Safety Officer shall be responsible for performing weekly, monthly quarterly and annual Quality Assurance testing and monitoring of Varian 21EX Medical Linear accelerator, Varian Eclipse treatment planning computer and Phillips CT simulator according to AAPM TG 51 protocol.  The Physicist shall also prepare all required records and reports in preparation for and maintaining the ongoing comprehensive American College of Radiology accreditation of Radiation Oncology program.  The Radiation Physicist shall be present during ACR inspections to address all inquiries.  Perform treatment planning as need, during absence of dosimetrist.The Radiation Physicist shall also serve as a Radiation Safety Officer responsible for implementing the Radiation Safety Program and ensuring that Radiation Safety activities are being performed in accordance with approved procedures and regulatory requirements.  As such, the Physicist investigate overexposures, accidents, spills, losses, thefts, unauthorized receipts, uses, transfers, disposals, misadministration, and other deviations from approved radiation safety practice and implement corrective actions as necessary.  Contractor shall be available to be on-station, as needed as Radiation Safety Officer within (1) Hour of notification by the Chief, Radiation Oncology (or designee).  Perform all duties associated with the radiation film badge system.The competencies and skills required of the Radiation Physicist/ Radiation Safety Officer are critical to the daily operation of the Hospital.  The proposed Contractor, RADPHYs, has been successfully performing an emergency purchase order for the last nine (9) months issued as a result two unsuccessful attempts to competitively procure the required services using GSAs Federal Supply Schedule as a procurement vehicle.  RADPHYs is unique in that they are currently the only known capable local source of providing qualified, competent, and a skilled Radiation Physicist/ Radiation Safety Officer on a part-time, three-days a week basis. Additionally, RADPHYS is the only contractor that is capable of providing a qualified on-call emergency Physicist on site within one (1) hour of being notified of an emergency which requires the services of a Radiation Physicist.  Additionally, as a result of RADPHYs locality to the VAMC and its 24 hour on call availability, they are able to provide the services required with the greater efficiency than any locum tenum contractor on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule.
