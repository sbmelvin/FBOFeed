<CONTACT>STEWART EVANS CONTRACTING SPECIALIST 9162789334     ;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Western Earthquake Hazards Team (EHZ), Menlo Park, CA has a requirement for the use five 100 kilohertz communication satellite channels.  The requirement is for one base year and four option years. The successful contractor must display the capabilities of providing required satellite band widths and availability for the specified time frame.  The minimum requirements are to lease Ku-band space segment of two geostationary satellites with coverage of the western United States (all of California and Oregon at a minimum).Uplinks must be within the range 14.0-14.5 GHz and be horizontally polarized.  Downlinks for a given satellite must be within one of the following 500 MHz bands: 10.95-11.45 GHz, 11.2-11.7 GHZ, 11.7-12.2 GHz or 12.25-12.75 GHz. The bandwidth offered shall not include frequencies within 400 KHz of the ends of the transponder. Also required is "Transponder Protected" grade of service.  The channels must all be on the same transponder and have a back-up or preemptible transponder available. The transponder proposed should not itself be preemptible.  The space segment configuration must be compatible with the Nanometrics Inc. of Canada Libra Satellite Seismograph System installed at USGS Menlo Park, CA.  This system uses a 3.8 meter antenna at the hub and 1.8 meter antennas at the remote VSATs that are located in the western US region.  It is mandatory all satellite services remain on the current Galaxy 25 and 26 satellites in use because changing satellites or polarization would make it necessary for USGS technicians to travel to all remote locations to re-point or change the polarization of each dish in use and the two 12 foot hub dishes. Certain satellites may not be visible to some of the remote dishes. Data is interrupted from the start of moving the first dish to the completion of moving or re-positioning the last dish. This interruption could last for days to weeks and would require hundreds of man hours and additional expenses re-engineering and moving dishes. Based on the above requirements, we intend to "negotiate on a sole source basis" with Intelsat General Corporation of Bethesda, MD in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and the procedures in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS' requirement may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  If no competitive opportunities exist, request for proposal (RFP) 08WRSS0010 will be made available to Intelsat General Corporation through the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) on or about February 20, 2008, IAW FAR 5.102(a)(1). This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-23, effective 26 December 2007. For further information, please contact the Contracting Specialist at (916) 278-9334 or sevans@usgs.gov. NAICS 517410 - Satellite Communications.  No numbered notes apply.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the overhaul/repair of an estimated annual quantity of 192 each Amplitron Tubes, NSN 5960-00-023-9482, Litton Systems Inc., now L-3 Communication's P/N L4953R, Raytheon Technical Services Co., P/N QK653 and Electronics Industries Assoc., P/N RK7577.  Raytheon, who subsequently sold their tube division to Litton, originally manufactured the tubes.  Northrop Grumman, Williamsport PA, acquired the Electron Devices Division of Litton Systems Inc.  L-3 Communications, Electron Devices Division, officially changed their name from Litton Systems Inc., Electron Devices Division, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman in December 2002.  The proposed contractor is L-3 Communications, Williamsport, PA.  The proposed contract provides for major overhaul or modification services in support of Air Route Surveillance Radar Models 1 and 2 (ARSR 1/2) systems.  The ARSR 1/2 are integral part of the Air Traffic control system. Raytheon originally built the ARSR 1 and 2 systems in 1957 specifically for the FAA.  In 1994 Raytheon sold their tube division to Litton.  This acquisition included the proprietary rights for repair of original tubes applicable to the ARSR 1 and 2 systems, as well as the test set for testing rebuild/overhaul of amplitron tubes.  The test set is a one of a kind unit, which was built specifically for testing the rebuild/overhaul of amplitron tubes in order to maintain FAA's stringent safety and reliability standards.  The amplitron electronic characteristics cannot be measured and aligned without the use of this test set.   The repair processes are proprietary to Northrop Grumman; however, the FAA has revised FAA Logistics Center Specification, FAA-D-1275, Tube, Electron, Amplitron, which coupled with a company's knowledge and experience should enable other vendors to be qualified to rebuild/overhaul these tubes.  However, a vendor must have access to a test set, which will be required in order to accomplish system testing.  The FAA does not have a test set to provide to a contractor as Government Furnished Property.   The type of contract contemplated under this requirement is Indefinite Delivery/Requirements.  Requirement is for a base year and includes option provisions to renew for three additional 1-year periods, to be exercised at the sole discretion of the FAA.   Interested vendors that have the capabilities to overhaul/repair these tubes and has access to a test set should respond with their documentation and proof of availability of test set to the Contracting Officer.  Only those responses providing the required documentation in response to this market survey will be considered prior to further action by the FAA.  Interested parties who can comply with and meet all of the requirements called out in this market survey should respond with their documentation in writing to the Contracting Officer. All interested sources must provide their responses/submittals no later than 2:00 PM, CST, February 29. 2008.  Information packages received after this date will be determined late and will not be considered. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.  The final determination by the FAA not to open this requirement to competition, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA.

<DESC>SUBJECT: KC-10 Communications/Navigation/Surveillance ? Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) Program:
The 727 Aircraft Sustainment Group (727 ACSG), Tinker AFB Oklahoma, is submitting a Pre-solicitation Notice for the KC-10 Communications/Navigation/Surveillance Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) Program.
The purpose of this notice is to provide industry with updated information about the status of the KC-10 Aircraft Modernization Program (AMP).  The government has determined that the full suite of KC-10 modernization requirements known as the KC-10 AMP, and the reduced-scope KC-10 AEP (described in the 653 Aeronautical Systems Squadrons presolicitation notice dated 30 Aug 2007) is beyond the reach of any foreseeable funding.
The Air Force is now pursuing an affordable program focused solely on alleviating the most urgent near-term capability shortfall of the KC-10 fleet its Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) capability.  
Given the very challenging budget environment, this refocused program?s scope will be aggressively managed to ensure its overall cost falls in Acquisition Category (ACAT) level III or lower.  An FY2009 release date for the solicitation is planned.  Contract award would occur in 2010.  The down-scoped program will be known as the KC-10 CNS/ATM program.  There will be further market research initiatives as well as a draft RFP prior to that.  An initial Request for Information will be posted on FedBizOpps in parallel to this announcement.  The RFI is seeking a quick industry assessment on the viability of the planned program given the budgetary and schedule constraints established by the operator.
The KC-10 AMP is now focused on ensuring that the KC-10 fleet?s CNS/ATM capabilities are upgraded to the standards that have been identified for implementation through calendar year 2015.
    
In order to ensure the affordability of this refocused program, industry is advised that the CNS/ATM program no longer requires features mentioned in previous announcements for the KC-10 AMP or AEP such as: a glass cockpit; specific obsolescence mitigation; real-time information in the cockpit; night-vision imaging system compatibility; or survivability.  The government still prefers solutions that provide growth provisions (modular open system architectures (MOSA)) versus closed solutions unless an offeror can provide a closed solution at a significant cost savings.  The program retains its focus on using commercial off-the-shelf or military off-the-shelf approaches.  Technical solutions featuring minimal non-recurring development are strongly desired.

Due to the urgency of upgrading the KC-10 fleets CNS/ATM capabilities before the new standards begin to significantly degrade its world-wide access, the government is now open to a more aggressive production schedule than previously stated.  Specifically, the government requires that the CNS/ATM program complete its upgrade of all 59 KC-10 aircraft by the close of fiscal year 2015 (30 Sep 2015).

Parallel to the KC-10 CNS/ATM aircraft program, the government will require updating the deployed KC-10 Aircrew Training System (hardware and courseware) to the CNS/ATM configuration.  The KC-10 CNS/ATM aircraft program will include the upgrading of existing KC-10 on-aircraft maintenance procedures.

The 727 ACSG still contemplates an acquisition strategy for the KC-10 CNS/ATM that utilizes a single contract encompassing System Design and Development (SDD), Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP), and Full-Rate Production (FRP).  LRIP and Full-Rate Production will be accommodated via priced contract options.

GENERAL INFORMATION  The government may issue Requests for Information on the FedBizOpps webpage (http://www.fbo.gov) for elements of the solicitation prior to releasing Draft and Final RFPs.  Potential foreign prime contractors are advised that no determination has yet been made on any restrictions pursuant to AFFARS 5305.204. 

This pre-solicitation announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation (Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP)).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice.  This notice is for information and planning purposes only.  The Government will not provide reimbursement of costs associated with any documentation or communication submitted in response to this notice.  Any submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  Therefore, any information that is deemed proprietary should not be submitted.  Questions or comments to this notice should be addressed to the Contracting Officer.

If a KC-10 CNS/ATM RFP is later released, a Notice of Contract Action will be published at least 15 days prior.  This announcement represents the 727 ACSGs initial acquisition strategy for the KC-10 CNS/ATM program.  The government reserves the right to change any or all of the assumptions outlined herein in the draft and final Request for Proposals.

The FOB Destination shall be Aurora, CO, 80011 and the contract action will result in a Firm Fixed Price contract.  The contractor shall be registered in Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) before an award can be made.  

The firm-fixed price purchase order will be awarded sole source to:
	Hayes, Inc.
	157 S. Broad Street, Ste 200
	Lansdale, PA 19446

Description of the Supplies or Services:
HAYES Medical Technology Directory
Hayes Health Technology Brief Service
Hayes Medical Technology Outlook

Statutory Authority:
The statutory authority for this acquisition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302 1 (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements

Demonstration of the Contractor's Unique Qualifications:
A subscription to Hayes Inc. Online provides immediate access to the:
Hayes Medical Technology Directory:
The Directory consists of over 350 comprehensive, evidence-based technology assessment reports on a wide range of healthcare technologies including medical and surgical procedures, drugs and pharmaceuticals, diagnostic and screening tests, alternative therapies, and medical devices/equipment.  Access to approximately 80 updated or new health technology evaluations per year.  The Directory provides a compendium of over 350 technology assessments on a wide-range of topics with approximately 80-90 new and updated assessments added per year.
Hayes Health Technology Brief Service:
	The Hayes Health Technology Brief Service includes access to Hayes Search & Summary which provides expedited reports with delivery in 3 to 5 business days of request.  The Hayes Health Technology Brief assesses new technologies for which there is some published evidence but not enough for a comprehensive assessment. The HAYES Health Technology Brief library includes approximately 80 new reports yearly. The medical technology assessments/reports provide a proprietary rating process to weigh the strength and quality of the evidence which is widely recognized and used by the health care industry, including TRICARE's managed care support contractors, in the development of their commercial program policy. No other company provides immediate access to such an extensive and current library of assessments/reports.
Hayes Medical Technology Outlook:
	The Hayes Medical Technology Outlook tracks medical tests, devices, procedures, drugs, and biologics that are currently in development or undergoing preliminary clinical testing.
		
A Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results:
The preparation and provision of evidence-based medical technology assessments is a new, developing, and very specialized field.  An online search was conducted for sources for medical technology assessments/evidence-based medical technology reports.  The following were identified:
	The California Technology Assessment Forum (http://ctaf.org),
	Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (http://www.icsi.org), and
	Blue Cross Blue Shield Technology Evaluation Center 	(http://www.bcbs.com/betterknowledge/tec) 

All of these other products allow access to a limited number of off-the-shelf medical technology assessments.  However the range and number of assessments available on these websites is not as extensive as the Hayes Directory of over 350 medical technology assessments and approximately 80 new Health Technology Brief Reports per year.  Also these assessments do not include a clear, concise, easily understandable, recognized rating of efficacy.

TRICARE is the name of the Department of Defense managed health care program for active duty military, active duty service families, retirees and their families, and other beneficiaries.  For more information about TRICARE, please feel free to visit: http://www.tricare.osd.mil.

(1) Perform the laboratory measurement of 176 SNPs for 2000 women and 16 SNPs for another independent sample of 2000 women in the Nurses? Health Study (NHS), to include organizing and managing the performance of the SNP analysis and 

(2) Create and share a data file including the above mentioned genotype data and related non-genetic variables for conducting a genome wide association study of abdominal adiposity.  

(3) Supporting codebook

The genetic, socio-economic, medical, diet and lifestyle data available in the NHS established by investigators from HSPH are unique to address our research questions and are the only ones that will fulfill the needs of the proposed study. The NHS established in 1976, is an ongoing large prospective cohort of U.S. female nurses on whom repeated and detailed information of diet, lifestyle factors and disease have been collected.  Moreover, blood and DNA samples are well archived in this cohort.   In addition, a genome-wide scan including 528,173 SNPs have been completed in this cohort.  Anthropometric measurements of overall adiposity and abdominal adiposity have been collected and validated in NHS.  Data from the NHS study are of high quality. Over the past two decades, procedures have been developed to ensure effective follow-up of participants and accurate data collection.

Main Base
Electrical power for the Main Base is supplied by two Rocky Mountain Power (RMP)-owned 46-kilovolt (kV) transmission feeders and one RMP-owned 138-kV transmission feeder. The preferred supply feeder originates at RMP?s Syracuse Substation and is routed to the Air Force-owned Hill AFB 46-kV switching station, where it terminates on the Air Force-owned structure. RMP?s 46-kV metering equipment is located in this switch station. The Hill AFB 46 kV switching station is located about a block west of the South Gate. The alternate 46- kilovolt (kV) supply feeder originates at RMP?s Riverdale Substation, where it is metered and operated in a ?normally open? configuration. It is then routed to the Air Force-owned Hill AFB Substation 2, where it terminates on the Air Force-owned structure. Hill AFB Substation 2 is located near the North Gate.  The 138-kV supply enters the Base from the east, and is routed to the Air Force-owned Hill AFB Substation 1, where it terminates on the Air Force-owned structure. This feeder is the only source of power for Substation 1.
The Air Force owns the entire Hill AFB electrical distribution system downstream of the three RMP delivery points. The Air Force system consists of one 46-kV switching station and approximately 6.8 miles of overhead 46-kV transmission line supplying four 46-12.47-kV distribution substations, one 138-12.47-kV distribution substation, and approximately 100 miles of 12.47 kV primary distribution line.
The 46-kV switching station is the termination and metering point for RMP?s 46-kV supply line. It consists of two 46-kV line terminations (one RMP-owned line and one Air Force-owned line) and one 46-kV oil circuit breaker. It is a conventional, outdoor, air-insulated transmission switching station configured in a single bus arrangement. This station provides control and overcurrent protection for the Air Force-owned 46-kV transmission line supplying the four Hill AFB distribution substations.
The 46-kV transmission line originates at the 46-kV switching station and is then routed to Substations 5, 4, 3, and 2. It is constructed in a single-pole, single-circuit configuration utilizing both ?Wishbone? and ?Z? type wood cross arm/suspension insulator pole-top assemblies and also narrow-profile horizontal-post insulator pole-top assemblies with 1,272 thousand circular mils (kcmil) aluminum conductor steel reinforced (ACSR) conductor. A 12.47-kV distribution circuit also occupies this common route. 
Substation 5 consists of four 46-kV line terminations, two 16.8/22.4/28-megavolt ampere (MVA) 46-12.47-kV load-tap changing (LTC) power transformers, one 12.5-MVA 46-12.47-kV LTC power transformer, one 12-MVA power transformer, and fourteen 12.47-kV metal-clad circuit breakers. It is a conventional, outdoor air-insulated distribution substation configured in a sectionalized triplex bus arrangement. This substation provides voltage regulation, control, and overcurrent protection for ten 12.47-kV feeders.
Substation 4 consists of two 46-kV line terminations, two 22.4-MVA 46-12.47-kV LTC power transformers, and thirteen 12.47-kV metal-clad circuit breakers. It is a conventional, outdoor air-insulated distribution substation configured in a sectionalized duplex bus arrangement. This substation provides voltage regulation, control, and overcurrent protection for seven 12.47-kV feeders. Substation 4 receives supplemental power from a Hill AFB-owned landfill gas combustion turbine (Facility 737). The supplemental generation capacity is approximately 1.2 megawatts (MW).
Substation 3 consists of two 46-kV line terminations, one 7.5/9.375-MVA 46-12.47-kV LTC power transformer, one 12.5/14 MVA 46-12.47 kV LTC power transformer, and nine 12.47-kV metal-clad circuit breakers. It is a conventional, outdoor air-insulated distribution substation configured in a sectionalized duplex bus arrangement. This substation provides voltage regulation, control, and overcurrent protection for five 12.47 kV feeders. 
Substation 2 consists of two 46-kV line terminations (one Air Force-owned line and one RMP-owned line), one 7.5/9.375 MVA 46-12.47-kV LTC power transformer, and three 12.47-kV metal-clad circuit breakers. It is a conventional, outdoor air-insulated distribution substation configured in a single bus arrangement. This substation provides voltage regulation, control, and overcurrent protection for three 12.47-kV feeders. 
The third feed to the base only supplies power to Substation 1. Substation 1 operates independent of the other four substations on the installation. Substation 1 consists of one 138-kV line termination (RMP-owned), one 138-kV air-break switch, one 138-kV circuit switcher, three 138-kV intermediate-class surge arresters, one 12/16/20-MVA 138-12.47-kV LTC power transformer, and four 12.47-kV metal-clad circuit breakers. It is a conventional, outdoor air-insulated distribution substation configured in a single bus arrangement. This substation provides voltage regulation, control, and overcurrent protection for three 12.47-kV feeders.
The primary distribution system consists of a total of twenty-nine 12.47-kV circuits. It is composed of overhead, pole-line construction (conventional, cross arm/pin insulator, open wire construction practices) with pole-mounted transformer banks, and underground construction (utilizing duct-type construction practices) with both outdoor pad-mounted transformers and indoor primary unit substations. It is estimated that 20 percent of the electrical ductbank lies beneath 3-inch asphalt pavements and that 20 percent of the electrical ductbank lies beneath 6-inch concrete pavements.  
The overhead primary system is principally composed of bare ACSR conductors of various sizes, with #4, #2, and 4/0 being the most common. The underground primary system is principally composed of shielded copper conductors of various sizes, with #1 and 4/0 the most common. It is further noted that more than 90 percent of the #1 conductors are lead-sheathed.  The majority of the distribution circuits are configured with loop tie switches to neighboring circuits. The pad-mounted transformers are principally conventional, dead-front units. All polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated transformers were replaced around 1992.
The Base monitors the loading and status of the electrical equipment at each of the five substations with a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system using direct and phone lines between each substation and the master controller in the Energy Monitoring and Control System (EMCS) Control Room in Building 15. (Building 15 monitors only the SCADA system 24/7.) This allows the Base to switch breakers in each substation. The SCADA system will be is included the Utilities Privatization solicitation. 
UTTR
Electrical power for UTTR is supplied by a RMP-owned 46-kV transmission feeder that is routed to the Air Force-owned UTTR Substation, where it terminates on the Air Force-owned structure. RMP?s metering equipment is located in this substation.

AETC CONS/LGCT , AFCESA Support Flight, 136 Barnes Avenue, Building 856 Annex, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403 is soliciting competitive offers for Air Force Utilties Privatization  - Hill AFB, UT Watewater Distribution System.  Anticipated release of RFP for this effort is on/around 14 Mar 2008. 

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. ?2688 ? Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a description of the system to be privatized:

Main Base
The Main Base area wastewater system consists of collection lines and lift stations primarily located west of the runway. The wastewater system east of the runway consists of relatively small collection systems mostly from individual buildings. Some of the buildings have been connected to the main system via a line across the south end of the runway. However, the majority of facilities are connected to septic tanks and drain fields or holding tanks that require periodic pumping. A tank truck is used to transfer wastewater from the holding tanks to a manhole on the Base collection system. With the exception of the sewage that flows to the septic tanks, all other sanitary sewage generated on Hill AFB is transported to the North Davis Sewer District (NDSD) for treatment.
Metering Stations
Wastewater flows from Hill AFB are discharged into the NDSD/Clearfield City wastewater systems along the south and west boundaries of the Base. Prior to leaving the wastewater system, those flows are metered at four Base-owned meter stations and three meter stations owned by the MFH Contractor. Air Force-owned discharge and instrumented meter points included in this solicitation are located as follows:
1.	Discharge Point 1 (Southgate Meter) ? at the intersection of Southgate Avenue and Highway 193. This flow is metered near Manhole 5-27 and is generated by the southeast portion of the Main Base. Flows through this discharge point include the wastewater treated by the industrial wastewater treatment plant (IWTP) and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)-contaminated groundwater extracted under the Federal Facilities Act Operable Unit (OU) 8 remediation project. (Discharges into NDSD system.)
2.	Discharge Point 2 (Hospital Meter) ? approximately 1,900 feet west of Southgate Avenue and on the north side of Highway 193. The system drawings show two meters on this line; one near the Base boundary and the other several hundred feet upstream. As additional facilities were being planned between the upstream meter and the Base boundary, the downstream meter was installed to capture the flows from these new facilities and the upstream meter was abandoned in place. The out-of-service meter located near Manhole 4-19 has been abandoned for several years. The active meter is located near Manhole 5-11. The southern portion of the Main Base generates this flow. (Discharges into NDSD system.)
3.	Discharge Point 3 (Truck Gate Meter) ? located near the truck gate for the Base. The meter is located between Manholes 8-23 and 8-24. (Discharges into Clearfield City system.)
4.	Discharge Point 4 (Railroad Meter) ? located in the Army Rail Shop area along the west boundary of Hill AFB, northwest of the intersection of Aspen Avenue and Maine Street, in the 1700 Area. The northern portion of the Main Base, the 1200 Industrial Area, and the facilities along Alabama Drive generate this flow. It is metered near Manhole 11-50. (Discharges into NDSD system.)
Sanitary Lift Stations
There are 21 sanitary wastewater lift stations with associated force mains located throughout the Main Base area. None of the lift stations have installed emergency generators. All are equipped with high-water alarms (local flashing red lights; no remote annunciation).
Wastewater Collection System
The Hill AFB wastewater collection system consists of approximately 300,000 feet of wastewater collection lines, varying in size between 6 to 15 inches, and approximately 850 manholes. The wastewater collection system dates back to the 1940s. In the older areas of the Base, the wastewater lines are vitrified clay pipes and the manholes are constructed of brick. Since the 1990s, as lines were replaced and new lines added, the replacement piping has been PVC and the new manholes have been constructed of pre-cast concrete.  Depth of burial for wastewater collections mains ranges from 6 to 30 feet.  Average depth of building service laterals is approximately 6 feet.
Two areas of the Main Base wastewater collection system have been surveyed with closed-circuit television (CCTV) as part of four separate surveys. The surveys were completed in 2005, 2004, 1997, and 1996. Approximately 71,000 feet along Wardleigh Road was surveyed in 2005, and approximately 26,000 feet in the 1200 Area was surveyed in 2004. Additionally, CCTV surveys were performed in October 1997 and December 1996. The October 1997 survey covered all the wastewater collection system piping in MHF Areas D, E, and F. The December 1996 survey generally covered the Main Base between the runway and Avenue E and the northern portion of Main Base between the ammunition storage area and New Hampshire Drive.
The 2005 survey identified cracked and broken pipe, crushed pipe, off-set joints, debris in the lines, tree root intrusion, and manholes buried beneath the surface. The debris was removed during the survey; however, other deficiencies were not corrected. The survey identified nine areas of deterioration that were severe enough to merit immediate corrective action and an additional 15 areas of concern that were not as severe but could become so if not corrected.
The 2004 survey identified cracked and broken pipe, crushed pipe, off-set joints, debris in the lines, tree root intrusion, and manholes buried beneath the surface. The debris was removed during the survey; however, other deficiencies were not corrected. The survey identified 13 areas of deterioration that were severe enough to merit immediate corrective action and an additional 29 areas of concern that were not as severe but could become so if not corrected.
The October 1997 survey identified wastewater lines with tree roots large enough to interfere with video camera operation; the roots were removed during the survey. The report presented five areas of immediate concern; however, no corrective actions were performed. Four of the areas were related to manhole problems. Another identified area of concern related to the service laterals from several residences to their connection to the main. The report identified 16 other areas where there were problems but that did not present an immediate concern. There were nine areas identified where sections of pipe had sagged enough to reduce the effectiveness of the wastewater collection system.
The 1996 survey identified 12 areas of deterioration that were severe enough to merit immediate corrective action; however, no corrective actions were performed in these areas. Generally, the problems were related to cracked or broken pipes. The report identified about 45 other areas of concern that were not as severe but could become so if not corrected. These problem areas were mostly the result of tree-root intrusions. The report further identified six areas where there were low spots or sags in the pipe. The manholes inspected for this report were considered to be in good condition. 
Base technicians advise that Hill AFB does not experience significant infiltration and inflow (I/I) problems, nor are there recurring problems with overflows.
UTTR
The wastewater system at UTTR consists of two sewer lift stations, which are approximately 15 and 38 years old, that move flows to wastewater lagoons for treatment. Both stations were upgraded and lined in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The piping systems that feeds and leaves the lift stations are approximately the same age as the lift stations. Twelve manholes are shown on the utility map. (Lagoons are an integral part of the system and are included in the Utilities Privatization solicitation.) The sewer lagoons were upgraded and enlarged as well as being modified to act as a mini-wetlands area. The project was completed in Spring 2000. Other remote sites with septic tanks and drain fields are excluded from the privatization study.
A wastewater system map of the UTTR area was provided (scale of 1?=1,200?). Measurements of the wastewater lines taken from the map were used to develop the inventory. Manholes were identified on drawings prepared as part of a Wastewater Facilities Evaluation Study completed in 1994 for UTTR.  
Little Mountain Test Annex
The wastewater system at Little Mountain consists of a gravity collection system where flows move to a septic tank and drain field for treatment. (The septic tank and drain field are not included in the Utilities Privatization solicitation; the point of demarcation is the septic tank inlet.) The original system was installed in 1960, and contains approximately 3,000 feet of wastewater lines. The collection mains are primarily 6- and 8-inch PVC pipe, while service laterals are older cast-iron pipe. The original septic tank, installed in 1960, has been abandoned; the new tank and drain field was installed in 1987 at a different location. The new system is very large and includes a 27,000?gallon tank, sized for approximately 300 people. With a daylight population of only 80 people and only three persons remaining on site round-the-clock, the system has more than enough capacity for any foreseeable growth. Long-range plans for Little Mountain call for replacing the septic tank and drain field with a package treatment plant.
A Little Mountain wastewater system map was provided (scale of 1?=1,200?). Measurements of the wastewater lines taken from the map were used to develop the inventory.

Wastewater collection and treatment are provided by the City of Wendover; there are no Air Force-owned wastewater collection system components to be privatized at this site.
Bovine
An incineration unit treats the wastewater; there are no Air Force-owned collection system components to be privatized at this site.

Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization solicitation:
?	Non-potable water fire-protection system, including deluge tanks, pipe, pumps, etc.
?	Irrigation systems
?	MFH water distribution system infrastructure
Main Base
Hill AFB receives water from two sources: on-Base deep wells and from the off-Base Weber Basin Conservancy District (WBCD).
The Delta aquifer is the major source of water for Hill AFB. The principal water-bearing zone varies from 50 to 150 feet in thickness at a depth ranging from 480 to 520 feet below ground surface. Although acceptable for consumption, water tends to be ?hard? and contains iron, calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Nine deep wells, depth ranging from 627 to 1,500 feet, provide potable water for the Installation. Wells 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are supplied backup power from emergency generators or diesel engine drives. Some of the emergency generators are interconnected to one or more water wells or pump stations. Water treatment at the Base consists of chlorination, fluoridation, and phosphate added to the water at the well site with unmanned injection systems. Wells 4 and 8 are not currently operated. Well 4 is not currently used for potable water production because of its extremely high iron content. Well 8 is not currently used for potable water production because of its arsenic content; it is currently disconnected from the water distribution system. Wells 4 and 8 require re-drilling before they can be fully integrated into the potable water system. Hill AFB is permitted to pump a maximum of 7,820,434 gallons per day from deep wells on the Main Base.
The supplemental water source (WBCD) supplies treated water to the Base at a single point near the South Gate entrance. A contract between Hill AFB and WBCD, dated 12 December 1952, requires WBCD to provide 1,018.79 acre-feet per year (approximately 333 million gallons). The contract also requires that WBCD have available 2,500 gallons per minute (gpm) at the point of delivery and that not less than 1.5 million gallons per day (gpd) be available. A single meter owned by WBCD measures consumption of WBCD water. The WBCD water allocation is a very important resource and must be used every year. If the allocation is not used, WBCD water may be reallocated to other users in this water-starved region. The WBCD allocation is used primarily between mid-May and December (peak usage months) to reduce the demand for well water. Historically, WBCD provided approximately one-third of the potable water used in the Main Base area. A vital feature of the WBCD water allocation is related to total annual consumption and the longstanding, very favorable sales rate. If the allocation quantity were to be exceeded for three consecutive years, then WBCD would have the right to renegotiate the ?grandfathered? sales rates. 
In the older areas of the Base, water pipe material is mostly cast-iron pipe with leaded joints or asbestos cement. Water lines installed after the mid-1980s have been polyvinyl chloride (PVC) class C-900 with tracer wire and warning tape. Average depth of burial of water mains is approximately 8 feet.  
Water is stored in six reservoirs with total capacity of 8.3 million gallons; the three steel tanks each have a cathodic protection system.
A supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is used to monitor water levels in the various tanks, and is used to control well pumps, booster pumps, and treatment processes in either automatic or manual modes. The SCADA system is included in the Utilities Privatization solicitation of the water distribution system.
A separate fire-protection system (not included in the Utilities Privatization solicitation) is operated to furnish water to large buildings requiring fire flows greater than can be provided by the potable water system. 
UTTR
All potable water for UTTR is supplied by two wells located in the Oasis cantonment area. Well 1 produces water at the rate of 300 gpm, with Well 2 producing water at the rate of 160 gpm. A relatively new PVC pipeline moves raw water from the wells to a reverse-osmosis treatment plant, rated at 6,000 gallons per hour. Because of the inferior quality of the water in Well 1, normally only Well 2 is used for potable water while Well 1 water is used primarily for dust control. (Well 1 water could be treated and used for potable water but it would require frequent recalibration of the treatment processes.) Treated water is pumped to two 500,000-gallon water-storage tanks situated on a hill overlooking the complex; the tanks are cathodically protected. The water distribution system, with the recent doubling of water storage capacity and the replacement of some of the major transite mains, is in very good condition.   
The water distribution system is limited to the Oasis complex because of the great distances and limited need at the remote sites. Water is delivered by either tank truck or by bottle to these locations. 
Little Mountain Test Annex
The water system at Little Mountain is supplied with potable water from WBCD through a 16-inch (WBCD-owned) supply line. (This water main exceeds the size of water mains on Hill AFB. The enormous size of this water main is related to a long-past mission requirement.) Water purchased from WBCD is piped and distributed under pressure directly into the Little Mountain system. The water used at Little Mountain is included in the total water allotment from WBCD. Water is metered at the annex entry point. An Air Force-owned chlorination station, also located at the annex entrance, maintains chlorine residuals.

AETC CONS/LGCT , AFCESA Support Flight, 136 Barnes Avenue, Building 856 Annex, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403 is soliciting competitive offers for Air Force Utilties Privatization  - Robins AFB, GA Wastewater Distribution System.  Anticipated release of RFP for this effort is on/around 14 Mar 2008. 

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. ?2688 ? Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a description of the system to be privatized:

The wastewater collection and treatment system at Robins AFB includes the domestic (sanitary) system. The industrial wastewater collection system and associated treatment plants are not included with the system to be privatized. Each system has its own set of collection piping and treatment facilities. 
The industrial system is made of up two treatment plants ? IWTPs 1 and 2. IWTP 1 discharges directly into the domestic treatment plant for final polishing. The POD from IWTP 1 is a buried valve at the north end of the Biological Treatment plant aeration basins. The treated effluent from IWTP 2 is combined with the treated effluent from the Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant in the effluent pump station. The point of demarcation is where the effluent from IWTP 2 enters the wet well at Building 8369.
There is also an on-Base GWTP, whose treated effluent is also combined in the effluent pump station. In addition, the backwash from the carbon columns at the GWTP is discharged into the line from IWTP 1 to SWTP 1, upstream of the Biological Treatment plant aeration basins. The GWTP, and its associated infrastructure, is not included with the wastewater system being privatized. The POD for GWTP discharge is where effluent from the GWTP enters the pipe between the chlorine contact chamber and Parshall flume. The POD for the backwash is the buried valve at the north end of the Biological Treatment plant aeration basins.
Treated wastewater from the Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant, IWTP 2, and the GWTP are combined in the effluent pump station prior to discharge offsite into the Ocmulgee River. Robins AFB?s treated wastewater is discharged into the Ocmulgee River under national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) Permit No. GA 0002852. There are three compliance points (outfalls) with permit limits for wastewater discharge, one each, from the Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant, GWTP, and IWTP 2. Outfall No. 008 is the monitoring point for the IWTP 2. Outfall, No. 009 is the monitoring point for the Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant, Outfall No. 010 is the monitoring point for the GWTP. 
The original construction of the domestic system infrastructure began in 1942. The domestic system consists of collection piping, manholes, lift stations, and a treatment plant. The original domestic wastewater treatment plant is not currently operational. In 1971, the original 1942 treatment plant was replaced with a more modern facility, which was designated as Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant No. 1 (SWTP 1).
SWTP 1 was originally designed to provide preliminary, primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment prior to discharge into the Ocmulgee River. The POD is where the discharge pipeline terminates at the Ocmulgee River. The original treatment facility consisted of a plant headworks, grit chamber, grinder, influent Parshall flume, primary sedimentation tanks, trickling filters, secondary clarifiers, centrifuge, and disinfection with chlorine.  Solids handling consisted of anaerobic digestion. The treatment facility was expanded in 1978 to include additional primary sedimentation tanks, aeration tanks (nitrification tanks), new secondary clarifiers, tertiary filters, and chlorination and dechlorination facilities.  Aerobic digesters and drying beds were added to the solids-handling facilities to replace the anaerobic digesters. 
Except for the former digesters of the original biological treatment facilities, these facilities are currently not in use. One of the former aeration basins has been converted to an aerobic digester to increase the capacity of SWTP 1. The second aeration basin has been converted into a holding tank for temporary storage of IWTP 1 discharge. Temporary storage of IWTP 1 discharge is required periodically to prevent SWTP 1 plant upsets. Occasionally discharge from IWTP 1 contains constituents harmful to the biological treatment processes of SWTP 1 and requires reduced blending rates through SWTP 1. The holding tank is used to achieve the required blending rates to prevent upsets at SWTP 1.
Further modifications made to SWTP 1 treatment facilities include the addition of an ultraviolet disinfection facility and the installation a plant-effluent pumping station. Chlorine disinfection is currently the primary treatment as the ultraviolet disinfection facility is inefficient for final polishing due to the iron content in the wastewater.  
Sludge generated from the aerobic and anaerobic (following stabilization) digesters is transferred for de-watering to a centrifuge at SWTP 1. The de-watered solids are then disposed of offsite at an approved facility.
In the 1960s, a treatment plant was constructed in the Building 800 area, near housing, to handle the increased load from the housing areas. This facility was referred to as Domestic Wastewater Treatment Plant No. 2 (SWTP 2). Currently, treatment equipment has been removed from SWTP 2 and replaced with a lift station located at the former headworks, which is used to transfer wastewater to SWTP 1. This lift station and the drying beds, which are still in service, are referred to as SWTP 2. 
There are 50 domestic wastewater lift stations located throughout the Base that are used to transfer wastewater to other lift stations or manholes.  All the sanitary wastewater is transferred to SWTP 1 for processing.  Most of the lift stations are equipped with two submersible-type pumps. Pumps and controls at the lift stations have been upgraded or replaced since 1991. SCADA monitoring equipment has been added, or is in the process of being added, to the lift stations. The SCADA system is not included with the system to be privatized.
Original materials of construction for the collection system consisted primarily of vitrified clay and concrete pipe with brick manholes. New construction is generally polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe, and concrete manholes. Standard installation practices are to install tracer wire or tape with plastic piping; however, it is not known if all plastic piping was installed with tracer wire or tape. The Contractor should not include any projects to install tracer wire on piping in their proposal. Any requirements for tracer wire will be addressed after contract award.
Most of the pipe is 4 to 15 inches in diameter. The domestic collection system is comprised of several different piping materials, including cast iron, asbestos cement, reinforced concrete, vitrified clay, ductile iron, and PVC. Approximately 70 percent of the collection piping material is vitrified clay or concrete, of which approximately 90 percent has been slip-lined. The average burial depth of the piping is approximately 8 feet below ground surface. Approximately 25 percent of the collection system is installed beneath paved surfaces.
Robins AFB has completed a five-year collection pipe improvement program to clean, inspect, and repair the sanitary sewer lines. Approximately 50 miles of pipe were cleaned and inspected through this program. Approximately 180 point repairs have been completed along these sections of pipe. The repairs were noted as point repairs and also include some repairs made for pipe breaks, which were independent of the program. In some cases, the point repairs were instead full segment repairs. Generally, lines are being repaired by slip lining with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe or with an in-situ liner.
Air Force operations include occasional, unscheduled, discharges of Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) to the wastewater treatment system.  Current treatment plant operations include the addition of de-foaming agents.
Robins AFB has excavation restrictions in portions of the Industrial Area due to contamination of subsurface soils and groundwater from spills, leaks, and other releases that predate regulatory restrictions.  This restricted excavation area houses machine shops, metal finishing, industrial waste treatments plant and associated underground piping, industrial materials storage, and drummed waste storage facilities.  Implementation of the remedy selected in the Excavation Plan for the Industrial Area is required in order to ensure the protection of personnel coming into contact with the site and to eliminate or minimize risk associated with the contamination.  This area of the Base is 84 percent paved, behind security fencing, under building foundations, or beneath streets.  There is very limited potential for exposure to workers or visitors in the area.  The most likely scenario in which exposure to contaminated soils might occur is in the event of maintenance or construction activities requiring excavation of affected soil. Maps of the area and a copy of the Excavation Plan for the Industrial Area will be supplied in the technical library.

AETC CONS/LGCT , AFCESA Support Flight, 136 Barnes Avenue, Building 856 Annex, Tyndall AFB, FL 32403 is soliciting competitive offers for Air Force Utilties Privatization  - Robins AFB, GA Electrical Distribution System.  Anticipated release of RFP for this effort is on/around 14 Mar 2008. 

Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. ?2688 ? Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority. Contract term is anticipated at 50 years. 

The following is a description of the system to be privatized:

	The Robins AFB water distribution system supplies water for residential, commercial and industrial use on Base. Construction of the water distribution system infrastructure began in the early 1940s and continues today as the installation grows. The system includes water wells, storage tanks, water treatment, distribution piping, valves, and other ancillary infrastructure. 
	Robins AFB does not receive water from any off-base sources. The Base produces its own water from wells drilled into the Bluffton Aquifer. Six wells (Wells 1, 5, 8, 16, 17, and 18 ) provide water to the distribution system for use on Robins AFB. All the wells, except Well 18, have an emergency generator for backup power in the event of a power outage. In addition to meeting Robins AFB?s drinking water requirements, the system supplies water to industrial facilities in support of Robins AFB?s depot maintenance mission. The water wells and associated water uses will remain property of the U.S. Air Force. The water well is the actual drilled hole in the ground and the contents that cannot be removed without damage.  This includes the well casing, well screen, gravel pack, and concrete grout.  The pump, pump column, and all associated equipment beyond the point of demarcation for the water wells are included with the system to be privatized.  The point of demarcation shall be the inside surface of the steel casing of each well.  A separate service contract will be awarded to maintain the water wells.
	Robins AFB?s ability to pump its own water is essential to its mission and security. A high emphasis is placed on Robins AFB?s ability to operate its water distribution system without interruption, and in the event of an outage, to return the system to service quickly. Degraded or interrupted water supplies will negatively impact the ability of the Base to meet its mission and productivity requirements. 
The level of water in the elevated tower (Building 175) controls the well pumps. A Microcat Class 9508 Smart RTU system connected to a Westinghouse PC 1100 programmable controller (NUMA LOGIC) controls the well pump motors. A new supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is programmed to replace current control system.  The water control system is programmed to pump from different wells depending on the system demand. The system alternates the lead pump every 24 hours. This arrangement distributes the workload to minimize the wear and tear on motors, as well as to allow the aquifer time to recover.  Well 18 is on a stand-alone system controlled by the water level in Storage Tank 2084 (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS)).  When the new SCADA system is installed, Well 18 will no longer operate stand-alone. The SCADA system is not included with the system to be privatized.
The water distribution system includes four elevated storage tanks (Tanks 2084, 999, 912, and 175), with a total capacity of 2.25 million gallons (MG). All the storage tanks have cathodic protection and, based on the five-year maintenance schedule, are programmed to be cleaned and inspected in January 2008. Tanks 175 and 999 have lead-based paint coatings that have been painted over.
	Distribution piping is constructed of cast iron (CI), ductile iron (DI), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and asbestos cement (AC). The most prominent pipe types are CI and DI; however, PVC is also present, but to a lesser extent. AC pipe is uncommon. CI pipe was used when the system was originally installed. In the early 1960s, DI pipe began to be used at the Installation. The use of PVC pipe began in the mid to late 1970s. Standard installation practices are to install tracer wire or tape with plastic piping; however, it is not known if all plastic piping was installed with tracer wire or tape. The Contractor should not include any projects to install tracer wire on piping in their proposal. Any requirements for tracer wire will be addressed after contract award. The average burial depth of piping is approximately 4 feet below grade. Approximately 28 percent of the buried piping is beneath paved surfaces.
Robins AFB has excavation restrictions in portions of the Industrial Area due to contamination of subsurface soils and groundwater from spills, leaks, and other releases that predate regulatory restrictions.  This restricted excavation area houses machine shops, metal finishing, the industrial waste treatment plant and associated underground piping, industrial materials storage, and drummed-waste storage facilities.  Implementation of the remedy selected in the Excavation Plan for the Industrial Area is required in order to ensure the protection of personnel coming into contact with the site and to eliminate or minimize risk associated with the contamination.  This area of the Base is 84 percent paved, behind security fencing, under building foundations or beneath streets.  There is very limited potential for exposure to workers or visitors in the area.  The most likely scenario in which exposure to contaminated soils might occur is in the event of maintenance or construction activities requiring excavation of affected soil. Maps of the area and a copy of the Excavation Plan for Industrial Area will be supplied in the Technical Library.  
	As defined in the Section J3.12, ?Right of Access to the Utility System?, the portion of the system subject to privatization extends from the wells to the edge of the building or to the upstream side of the building?s post indicator valves (PIV) or backflow prevention devices. The exception is the golf course, the Steam Plant, and the fire-suppression storage tanks at Facilities 95 and 20091. At the golf course, the point of demarcation is the upstream side of the meter, which is downstream of the backflow device. For the Steam Plant (Building 177), the system subject to privatization stops at the upstream side of the backflow prevention device on the service line to the 100,000-gallon storage tank. For the fire-suppression tanks at Facilities 95 and 20091, the point of demarcation is the upstream side of the altitude valve on the service line to the tanks.
	Robins AFB treats produced groundwater at each well prior to the water entering the distribution system. Groundwater treatment consists of chlorine gas, fluoride, phosphate, and lime injection. Robins AFB has initiated a program to replace chlorine gas with sodium hypo-chloride treatment systems. Wells 5, 16, 17, and 18 have been converted. Wells 1 and 8 are not currently programmed for conversion.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The maintenance and logistics services support required include the replacement of the main wing super spar, all three segments; left, right, and center.  The main wing super spar is a flight critical component; the failure of which could have catastrophic consequences, so it is absolutely imperative that this complex replacement, inspection, and subsequent repairs, are performed by experts thoroughly familiar with the inspection requirements who are in possession of, or have the rights too, OEM data and engineering support.  This requirement will cause extensive disassembly of the aircraft wing structural components, and subcomponents, resulting in substantial out-of-commission times for the aircraft thus mandating that this requirement be bundled with the accomplishment of the aircrafts normally scheduled annual inspection; to include the accomplishment of non-routine maintenance items identified by the maintenance entity during the accomplishment of the inspection.  Qualified vendors must be an approved vendor for the Beech (Raytheon) Aircraft Company.  Furthermore, vendors must be approved by the aircrafts original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to perform this main wing super spar replacement on aircraft in this age category, and must have possession of the required OEM engineer drawings showing allowable dimensions, clearances and tolerances of flight critical wing super spar components, and must possess the unique, tools, test sets, facilities, equipment, and jigs required for inspection accomplishment.  Qualified respondents to the impending solicitation must provide detailed and concise information in their own format and in sufficient detail for the Government to make a determination if they can be considered as a qualified source.  A Statement of Work and Technical Requirement/Work Package will be provided with the resulting solicitation.  The performance will be for a 3 month period from the date of award.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811310, with a size standard $6.5 million dollars.  The procurement will be a total small business set-aside.  Request for Quote (RFQ) No. DJMS-08-Q-0015 will be available on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) on or about 13 Feb 08 and responses will be due 20 Feb 08.  The RFQ will be posted in its entirety at the FedBizOpps website.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued and electronic proposal submissions will be accepted.  Only proposals from qualified responsible vendors, to perform the maintenance requirements will be considered.  The Government has the sole discretion as whether or not a potential vendor is qualified.  NOTE:  Contractors proposing on the solicitation must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for award or payment.  The CCR database may be accessed via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  All responses must be submitted by facsimile; 405-231-4531 or by email to the point of contact mark.melendez@usdoj.gov.  All interested sources will be required to submit their proposal responses electronically to the point of contact; Mark Melendez by the close of business, 3:00 PM CT, February 20, 2008.  Note 1.

<DESC>This amendment removes the Small Business set-aside, and changes the procurement to Full and Open Competition.  

This procurement is for a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) for commercial additions, major renovations, tenant finish, asbestos abatement, and general repair and alterations of federally owned and leased properties. This is an unrestricted procurement (Full and Open Competition), and may result in up to five awards.  Awards will be made to the responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size stand of $31 million.  

This contract will have no pre-established fixed contract prices. Each contract will consist of a base year, extending 365 calendar days from the date of the award and four (4) additional one-year duration options to be issued at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Combining base and option years, the potential duration for this contract is five years.
 
The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer who will issue written task orders to the contractor. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. Task order values will range from $2,000 up to $3,500,000.  Task Orders may fall below or above this limit; however contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract. The annual minimum (cumulative) task order amount guaranteed each contractor is $10,000.  The annual maximum (cumulative) task order amount allowed each contractor is $3,500,000.  The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $87,500,000.

The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction and renovation by design-build or design-bid-build of general construction at various locations within GSA Region 8.

All work will be in accordance with individual task order requirements, specifications, and drawings provided with each project.  

All contractors receiving contract award will be required to have a permanent business office in the state of Colorado within 45 days of contract award. 

The selection process will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15.3 source selection procedures.  Proposals will be evaluated on:

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY.  IT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  It is the Government?s intent to issue, on or before 14 Mar 2008, solicitation N69450-07-R-0555, an OMB Circular A-76 (Revised Nov 2006) Cost Comparison Study, to provide Emergency Management Dispatch (EMD) Support Services at various locations throughout the continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii, and Guam.  Approximately 458 Department of Defense incumbent service providers are affected by this public-private competition.  

The functions include: Alarm and Detection Systems Monitoring, Video Surveillance Equipment Monitoring, Communications Monitoring, Records Checks, Communication Records and Reports, National Dispatch Center Consolidation, Contingency Operations and Alternate Dispatch.  Performance periods will include a six (6) month phase-in period, a two (2) month base performance period, four (4) twelve (12) month option periods and a four (4) month option period, for total performance duration of five (5) years.  A performance-based, firm fixed price type contract is anticipated.  The North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 561621, Security Systems Services (except Locksmiths), and the small business size standard is $11 million.  PARTICIPATION IN THIS ACQUISITION IS UNRESTRICTED.  However, in accordance with Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), should this solicitation result in subsequent award to a large business, a subcontracting plan will be required prior to award.

The Government anticipates issuing this solicitation on or before March 2008, receiving proposals 60 ? 90 calendar days after issuance, and conducting a Pre-proposal conference within 30-45 calendar days after issuance.  Additional details to be contained in the solicitation.  Availability of the solicitation will be limited to electronic medium which is available for download via the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at http://www.neco.navy.mil under the solicitation number. The official plan holders list will be maintained on and can be printed from the website. All prospective Offerors and plan rooms are encouraged to register as plan holders on the website. Plan holders lists will only be available from the website. Registering Offerors and plan rooms must provide a complete name, complete mailing address and area code and phone number, Offeror type (prime contractor, sub contractor, supplier or plan room), email address and size (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, woman owned small business or other).  Notification of any changes (amendments) to the solicitation will be made only on the Internet.  It will be the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any posted changes.  In accordance with FAR 15.1, and OMB Circular A-76, the Competitive Sourcing Acquisition Center of Excellence (CSACOE) Charleston, SC will be using the low priced technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection process for this acquisition. Please refer to sections L & M of the solicitation, once issued, for details regarding the evaluation criteria and submission requirements.   

The solicitation will not result in a contract unless the costs of contracting are lower than the costs of continued Government performance by the minimum cost differential, in accordance with the OMB Circular A-76 (1 Nov 2006).  The conversion differential is a cost that is the lesser of:  (1) 10% of the Most Efficient Organization?s (MEO) personnel-related costs on Line 1 of the Standard Competition Form (SCF) or, (2) $10,000,000 over all of the performance periods stated in the solicitation. In addition, a contract will not be awarded unless a determination has been made that no competitive advantage is gained by the contractor?s share contribution to its employer?sponsored health insurance plan or benefits, or by the contractor?s share contribution to its employer?sponsored retirement plan or benefits.  As stated in FAR Clause 52.207-3, Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government-performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for available positions, if qualified.

<DESC>KC-135 AIRCRAFT EXTENSION PROGRAM (AEP) INCREMENT I, BLOCK 45 MODIFICATION PROGRAM

 
The 551 Aircraft Sustainment Squadron (ACSS), 827th Aircraft Sustainment Group (827 ACSG), Tinker AFB OK, is submitting an industry notification for the Block 45 Modification Program. 

FOR PLANNING PURPOSES 
 
The purpose of this notification is to provide industry with information regarding the status of the Block 45 Modification Program.  To this point the Air Force has issued several Requests For Information (RFI)?s and held one industry day.  The Air Force is aware and appreciates the extensive efforts industry has put forth in developing responses and researching solutions for the RFI?s and the previously anticipated Request For Proposal (RFP) in Nov 08.

The Air Force is now asking any efforts industry is putting forth towards a Block 45 solution be temporarily suspended.  The Air Force is reassessing the Block 45 contents due to changes in Air forces policies concerning modifying legacy platforms with new capabilities.  At this point, the Air Force can not confirm what modifications Block 45 will contain.  Obviously, Block 45 will not be an FY08 contract award and depending on the new make-up of the program, it may not be an FY09 award.  The Air Force anticipates program will remain an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program managed at OC-ALC by the 551 ACSS.  

GENERAL INFORMATION 
As soon as the Air Force determines the contents of the program, an RFI will be released on FedBizOpps webpage (http://www.fbo.gov) for elements of the solicitation and intends to host another industry day prior to releasing draft and final RFPs. 

This industry notification is not to be construed as a formal solicitation (Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a RFP).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice.  This notice is for information and planning purposes only.  The Government will not provide reimbursement of costs associated with any documentation or communication submitted in response to this notice.  Any documentation submitted, becomes the property of the U.S. Government, and will not be returned.  Therefore, any information that is deemed proprietary should not be submitted.  Questions or comments to this notice should be addressed to the Contracting Officer.

Interoperability of the components is essential to functional system; components not certified by Entrust nor Safenet cannot guarantee that products purchased from sources other than Safenet will support the continued operation of the Departments PKI.4.      An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full  and open competition.  IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires SafeNet Luna products to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority.  5.      A demonstration that the proposed contractorýs unique qualifications or  the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. Entrust and Safenet will only provide support for products purchased from Entrust or Safenet. If there are support issues on product not purchased through Entrust or Safenet, they will defer to the supplier of the product. Maintenance of these products is required to ensure that any problems with the equipment will be rectified immediately by Entrust and Safenet. Installation of a different hardware security module may have the following issues:       1.    Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configuration, voiding other warranties associated with the equipment and software.       2.    Interoperability cannot be guaranteed.       3.

A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from  as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD synopsis was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. Attempts were made to gain quotes on the requested items from other vendors. 7.      A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to  the Government will be fair and reasonable.  A price analysis will be conducted to determine if the cost is fair and equitable. 8.      A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a  statement of the reasons market research was not conducted. Safenet is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch and support their software, as well as replace defective hardware with equipment with identical technical specification to those currently installed...PKI/BLADE is a COTS solution that provides PKI functionality and biometric authentication to the OpenNet.  Even though it is a COTS solution, it is also a proprietary solution.  Should a wider variety of digital encryption services and products become known to IRM/SI, these products will be considered as potential sources.<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>15 -- Replacement AutoPilot System
<SOLNBR>RFI0006
<RESPDATE>011508

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Replacement Autopilot System, Flight Director, Radar Altimeter (RA) and potentially Angle of Attack (AOA) systems for 417 KC-135R/T and 2 OC-135B Special Purpose Aircraft

NOTICE TO INDUSTRY: This RFI is for planning purposes only.  The 827 ACSG understands that components of the proposed C/KC-135 Block 45 Modification program are discussed within this RFI.  The proposed Block 45 Program remains on track for a release of a Draft RFP in the near future.  This RFI does not necessarily change the current Bock 45 modification program in its current form (Digital Flight Director, Radar Altimeter, NVIS, and Aeromedical).

PURPOSE
The 827th ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost, schedule, and performance parameters to remove the existing Digital Autopilot System (ASW-48), ALQ-141 Flight Director, AL-101 Radio Altimeters and potentially AOA systems and install a replacement dual Digital Autopilot (DA) System with Flight Directors (FD), RA, and AOA systems together with associated components (hardware, software, etc).  The installations for these efforts will be as a block, not separate stand alone installations.

DESCRIPTION
The KC-135R/T and OC-135B aircraft autopilot, flight director and radio altimeters need replacing due to obsolescence, poor reliability, and high maintenance costs.  Replacement DA with FD, RA and AOA systems should use Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) or Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) equipment to the maximum extent possible.  The modified aircraft must meet current and planned FAA and ICAO requirements including, but not limited to:  Worldwide capability and certification with Required Navigation Performance (RNP) of 0.15 (total system accuracy of 0.15 nautical miles 95% of the flying time).

New systems must:
- Maintain existing airworthiness certification
- Be protected against electromagnetic pulse
- Ability to store and provide any detected faults and provide maintenance crews with fault verbiage

The proposed dual DA with FD must provide the following capabilities:
- Integrated 3-dimensional guidance and/or control for all navigation/approach solutions and provide for aircrew cueing and warning via the currently installed integrated multi-function displays and cockpit warning systems
- Expandable and upgradeable to support future growth toward 4-dimensional navigation, auto-throttles, integrated altitude alerting, and category landing capabilities
- Continual crosschecking 
- Vertical navigation (e.g. provide the ability to bring the aircraft to approach from cruise altitude) while providing airspeed or throttle queues to the aircrew for airspeed deviation through annunciation (there are no auto-throttles on the KC-135)
- Autopilot system should receive and provide digital outputs to all associated systems with the exception of those requiring servo, synchro, or other analog signal inputs
- When installed, the system will be able to accept aircrew-selectable air refueling receiver type profiles to allow autopilot to compensate for incoming receiver aircraft, reducing the number of un-commanded autopilot disconnects
- Dual autopilot control panels
- Provide dual surface sensing at the horizontal stabilizer
- Perform yaw control on OC-135 aircraft and potentially on KC-135R/T (replacement KC-135R/T yaw control must include engine failure Assist system and series yaw damper functions).
- Ideally use the existing MAX and AL-CL take-off profiles.

The proposed RA must provide the following capabilities:

- New receiver-transmitters and coax cables
- Low probability of intercept mode or ability to turn off emission.
- provide altitude inputs to all equipment currently supported, while providing digital altitude data to the new DA systems
- redundant data to all systems now using AL-101 data.
- Ideally provide redundant digital data to all systems now integrated with the AL-101
- Provide altitude data from 0-2500 feet with 0-50,000 feet desired.
- Error crosschecking between receiver-transmitters and report to crew errors in excess of 4 feet from 0-100 feet and 4% above 100 feet. 

RESPONSE
Responses shall address:
1.	Performance parameters, to include design, installation, reliability, and maintainability data
2.	Please break out the total program estimated (rough order of magnitude) cost information with breakout of non recurring engineering, modification kits, and installation (each broken down by systems) with the following items called out on a spreadsheet: DA, DFD, RA, AoA, Total Program Cost. In the break down of cost include NRE, Group A/B Kit, Install and total at the bottom of each item. 
3.	Delivery schedule/product availability
4.	Any alternatives/suggestions that satisfy airworthiness requirements, to include cost and schedule
5.	Provide separate pricing for overhaul data.
6.	Developmental schedule (duration from contract award to on aircraft testing completion)
7.	Component lead times (the longest lead time only for each system is required)
8.	Estimated support equipment (broken by system)
9.	Any alternatives/suggestions that satisfy airworthiness requirements, to include cost and schedule

Interested firms should also include the following in their response:

-Company Name and Address
-CAGE Code (if available)
-Point of Contact
-Size of Business (i.e. Large/small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concern, Minority-owned business)
-U.S. or Foreign Owned Entity

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify production sources for the Aircraft Flare Parachute LUU-2 D/B, NSN 1370-01-537-9031 and Aircraft Flare Parachute LUU-19 B/B, NSN 1370-01-537-9304.  FOB origin, see note 8, first article test is required. estimated date of issue: 30 June 2008, estimated opening date: 30 July 2008. It is anticipated that a 5 year IDIQ contract will be generated as a result of the solicitation.  Point of contact is: Julie Coughlin (309) 782-6139, e-mail Juli e.coughlin@us.army.mil<BR>The Air force and Navy use these aircraft-launched flares for nighttime illumination of surface areas in search and attack operations. This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.  The Government will utilize the information provided only to dev elop the acquisition strategy for future requirements.  All information submitted will be held in a confidential status.<BR><BR>The LUU-2 D/B flare is 36 inches long, 4.9 inches in diameter and weighs approximately 29 pounds.  It consists of four major com ponents: the mechanical timer, the parachute suspension system, the Out-of Line Igniter (OLI), and the case assembly with tamped candle.  The timer consists of a mechanical timer and related hardware enclosed in a lexan plastic housing.  The mechanical tim er is a verge type, three-gear timer, powered by a torsional mainspring.  A phosphorescent plastic decal with calibrated markings to indicate the feet-of-fall prior to parachute deployment and flare functioning is located on the face of the timer cover.  T he decal has a SAFE position and timer settings from 250 to 11,000 feet-of-fall.  Under the pointer portion of the timer knob, and as part of the knob, a flexible arm is located with a detent that will retain the knob in the recess next to the correspondin g timer setting.  The timer knob has a quick attach-detach spring operated latch which allows the lanyard loop to be connected to the knob.  A pawl release mechanism retains the timer assembly in the flare housing.  A mechanical destruct feature makes the timer inoperative after it is functioned.  The parachute suspension system utilizes an 18-foot diameter cruciform shaped canopy for stability.  Two riser cables connect the parachute to a bulkhead separating the parachute compartment from the remainder of the flare assembly.  One cable is attached to an explosive bolt for parachute dump at candle burnout.  The ignition system utilizes a lanyard that is attached to one of the parachute riser cables.  The lanyard is threaded through the bulkhead and past the candle in an internal raceway along the side of the aluminum case leading to the ignition assembly in the ignition housing near the candle's face.  The lanyard is attached to a triggering mechanism consisting of the Out-of-Line Igniter (OLI).  The pyrotech nic firing train consists of a percussion primer, boron-potassium nitrate pellets, and a propellant wafer.  The illuminating candle is a tamp cast composition of magnesium (61%), sodium nitrate (30.9%), and polymer binder (8.1%).  The candle is approximate ly 20 inches long and weighs approximately 20.5 pounds. Please note that the igniter is a Thiokol proprietary part.<BR><BR>The LUU-19 B/B is derived from the LUU-2 flare.  The two flares are identical in form, fit and function, except the LUU-19 provides a  near- infrared illumination requiring night-vision equipment to detect.  This enables its use in covert target illumination and rescue operations.  The illuminant candle weighs approximately 27.5 lbs and the composition is proprietary to ATK Thiokol.  Th e LUU-19 weighs 36 lbs.  All other details of the LUU-19 B/B are the same as the LUU-2 D/B described previously.<BR><BR>The technical data packages (TDPs) are c lassified as DISTRIBUTION D limited distribution.  Distribution D means that the TDP cannot be distributed on the Internet.  The TDPs contain technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, (Title 22, U.S.C., SEC 2751 ET SEQ) or t he Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended titled, 50 U.S.C. APP 2240 ET SEQ.  Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  Disseminate IAW provision of DOD Directive 5230.25.   Offerors must be registered with the joint  certification program, battle creek, michigan at the following web site: HTTP://WWW.DLIS.DLA.MIL/JCP/DEFAULT.ASP, in order to receive a copy of the technical data package (TDP). After receipt of required certification, the contractor shall request a copy of the TDP via email from julie.coughlin@us.army.mil.  Request must include: cage code, company name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and point of contact.<BR><BR>After receipt and review of the TDPs, interested companies should respond by providing  the Government the following information:  a brief summary of the companys capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria) and availability.  Please indicate your business size in your response.  Interested companies should provide minimum and maximum monthly production quantities and identify the remaining capacity for simultaneous production of all the items listed above (and if manufacturing resources are shared with other ite m/production lines).  Additionally, it is requested you provide the Minimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) required for economical production.  A respondent to this survey should be able to show adequate technical and manufacturing capability and good past per formance in the pyrotechnics industry.  A respondent to this market survey must have available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture these items.  If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing , personnel, etc.) available, the respondent, must be able to demonstrate and should describe his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion.

<SUBJECT>G -- USSOCOM Care Coalition Recovery Pilot Program
<DESC>Sole Source Synopsis - USSOCOM Care Coalition Recovery Pilot Program (CCRPP). The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to issue a contract modification to contract H92222-07-C-0056 with Enable America Inc., 101 East Kennedy Blvd. Suite # 3250, Tampa, Florida 33602-5151. It is anticipated that this modification will be issued within the next one-hundred twenty (120) days to extend the period of performance of the USSOCOM Care Coalition Recovery Pilot Program (CCRPP).  This award is based on 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), whereby the supplies and services required are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, and no formal requests for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement is currently available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. GENERAL INFORMATION: On 26 January 2007, USSOCOM issued solicitation H92222-07-R-0017 allowing for full and open competition to establish a United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Care Coalition Recovery Pilot Program to improve the Special Operations casualties recovery outcome by early introduction of casualty mentors and providing awareness regarding motivating activities available that boost their confidence and self esteem to better compete for wounded warrior friendly employment opportunities developed through community outreach and employment network development. Through the formal source selection process, Enable America?s proposal was the most highly rated proposal and stood alone in the competitive range based on the evaluations conducted in accordance with the established evaluation criteria.  To open this requirement to competition would mean the potential for having more than one pilot program running parallel which would involve cost duplication, more time to administer and would not be in the best interest of the Government, nor that of wounded warriors the program is designed to help.  To date, the current CCRPP is the only known recovery assistance program that addresses mentoring, wellness, community outreach, and resource-networking functions as defined by the USSOCOM Statement of Objectives contained in H92222-07-R-0017.  The overall scope and support concept of the pilot program is not changing as a result of this proposed modification.  Rather, the period of performance is being extended to allow for adequate data collection and thorough analysis of participant data and recovery outcomes.  Experience associated with the CCRPP to date has indicated that meaningful data is not obtainable as limited by the current period of performance.  Analysis has shown that recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration of casualty participants takes far longer than one year for the most basic of severe injuries and up-words of five years for the casualties who derive the greatest benefit and depend upon this pilot program.  If the pilot program is not extended to allow for the collection of adequate and complete patient data related to overall responsiveness/success of the mentoring, wellness, community outreach, and resource-networking functions, the USSOCOM Care Coalition will be unable to identify the benefits or improve the recovery outcomes of SOF casualties.  Additionally, not extending the pilot program would be detrimental to the current program participants? recovery, rehabilitation, and reintegration process.  As a result of this proposed modification, the anticipated period of performance of the pilot program extend through 31 March 2012 if all options are exercised.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Portfolio, Clear Front Report Cover, to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Clear Front Report Covers by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Portfolio, Clear Front Report Cover
7510-00-NIB-0811
7510-00-NIB-0812
7510-00-NIB-0813
7510-00-NIB-0814

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Clear Front Report Covers to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

ESS-55806		AVE-47796		SPR-71454		SMD-87456
ESS-58806		AVE-47960		SPR-71463		SMD-87461

Operation and Use of the Detroit Vehicle Infrastructure Integration Initiative Developmental Test Environment (DTE) following the Proof of Concept Test  

Agency:  RITA, DOT

Action: Notice, Request for Information (RFI)

Summary:  For approximately 4 years USDOT has conducted research in Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (VII). VII supports secure two-way communication between vehicles and between vehicles and the transportation infrastructure.  Potential application areas include safety (e.g., advanced brake warning between vehicles, intersection collision avoidance), public sector mobility (e.g., improved signal control and coordination) and commercial (e.g., off-board navigation, e-payment for services).  In order to operationally test the VII concept, USDOT established a VII Developmental Test Environment (DTE) in Detroit, Michigan and will conduct a Proof of Concept (POC) test in the winter and spring of 2008.  Following the POC, the US DOT may keep the Detroit Development Test Environment (DTE) operational, so that both US DOT sponsored VII testing can continue and so that other organizations may conduct live VII testing as well.  The USDOT is interested in receiving 1) input and expressions of interest in using the DTE by other private and public sector entities and 2) input and expressions of interest on options for continuing to operate and maintain this VII DTE.

The responses to this RFI may result in the government releasing a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a potential award of a contract to operate and maintain the DTE Michigan test site.

Due Date:  Comments and responses to the Questions should be received in writing on or before:
February 28, 2008.

Purpose of the Notice:

The purpose of this request for information is:

1)	To gauge interest in use of the DTE following the conclusion of the POC testing; 
2)	To determine how the DTE facility should be operated post POC;
3)	To determine interest from both commercial and non-commercial entities in operating, managing, and maintaining the DTE, including potential mechanisms (e.g., contract, cooperative agreement) and opportunities for cost sharing and/or cost-reimbursement basis;
4)	To determine a business model for managing the DTE that is acceptable both to the potential user community and to the USDOT.

Summary of questions: 

Answers to the following questions will help RITA to determine if and how the Detroit DTE should be maintained and operated post POC.  For clarity, the questions are divided into two areas - those for potential users and those with an interest in operating, managing, and maintaining the DTE.  However, it is recognized that an organization may fall into both categories, and therefore, respond to all questions.   

Questions for Potential Users

1)	Do you feel that continued use of the Detroit DTE will be worthwhile and of value to your VII-related work?
2)	If the Detroit DTE were available for use, would you use it?  What types of VII tests would you conduct?  Examples might include new applications, new technologies, new equipment, research, etc.  
3)	Do you agree with the proposed DTE usage principles defined below? What changes or alternatives, if any, would you recommend? 
4)	If the DTE were only available on a full fee-for service basis, recovering all costs, would you make use of it?
5)	Is the current configuration of the Detroit DTE adequate or is additional or less size/capability/capacity required for your possible use?  If changes are necessary to support your specific testing, what modifications do you feel should be made?   
6)	What recommendations, if any, do you have on the type of organization (e.g., for profit, not for profit, university, governmental, etc.) that should manage the Detroit DTE?

Questions for Potential Operators

1)	Do you agree with the proposed DTE usage principles defined below? What changes or alternatives, if any, would you recommend?
2)	What recommendations do you have concerning the business model for the operation of the DTE?  
3)	What cost sharing models should be considered?


Background:

Linking vehicles and the transportation infrastructure into an integrated, nationwide system has been a vision of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) for almost two decades.  Multiple studies indicate that doing so would provide significant safety benefits in preventing crashes as well as mobility benefits through the provision of real-time information on the road network, traffic flow, and weather conditions.  This information would enable travelers to make better decisions and allow transportation managers to more effectively manage the transportation system.  Accordingly, the Vehicle-Infrastructure Integration (VII) initiative was created to improve safety, mobility and commerce by deploying a secure communications infrastructure on roadways nationwide and in all production vehicles.

Because of the need for priority access to support safety critical-messages, initial efforts began with obtaining radio spectrum from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for safety applications in the 5.9GHz DSRC band. While DSRC is the only communication media currently being used in the Detroit DTE, other means of communication between the vehicle and infrastructure may be considered.  Early program activities focused on definition of the VII system, its requirements, and architecture.  An initial set of applications was defined and use cases were generated for them.  Some of these applications are considered public-sector applications; others such as e-payment are under the purview of the private-sector.  Several trial use standards were developed for the communications protocols.  During 2007, roadside and onboard vehicle equipment was designed and prototypes were constructed.  These were first tested in a laboratory environment at the component and integration levels and then tested on a closed test track.  Recent activities have focused on the establishment and use of a Development Test Environment in Michigan for continuation of Proof of Concept (POC) testing in a field environment.  During POC testing, application stubs will be used to test the capability of the VII architecture.  This POC testing will occur in the winter and spring of 2008.  

Description of the Detroit DTE Facility:  The DTE operates on the public highway network in a suburban area outside of Detroit Michigan.  A FHWA contractor is currently operating and maintaining this facility through the June 2008.  This network consists of 43 center-line miles of arterials and 32 center-line miles of freeways on I-96 and I-275.  Roadside Equipment (RSE) has been placed at 57 sites along this network.  The RSEs communicate with on-board equipment in vehicles using DSRC wireless communications.  Various communications technologies, including G3 cellular, T1 lines, and WiMAX, provide backhaul connectivity from the RSEs to a Service Delivery Node located at the Road Commission for Oakland County Michigan?s Traffic Operations Center, and an Enterprise Network Operations Center currently located at Booz Allen Hamilton?s facility in Herndon Virginia.  It is envisioned that future testbeds will be integrated into this overall VII network.  There are also interfaces between the Detroit DTE and High Accuracy National Differential GPS test sites.  Depending on the test environment requirements for follow-on use and available funding, the DTE could be maintained in its current configuration, reconfigured, downsized, or upsized.  

Principles of use concept for the DTE:  If it is determined that the Detroit DTE should be kept operational following the POC, the following are one possible set of operating principles.  The purpose of these principles is to define the ground rules and basic expectations for post POC DTE access, use, and maintenance.  They are provided in this RFI as additional information for consideration, and feedback on these or alternative operating principles is welcomed: 

1	Priority for use will be given to any efforts funded or sponsored by US DOT.
2	All other parties wishing to use the DTE for testing purposes shall have equal access to the facility.  
3	A process will be established for determining access schedules and for resolving schedule conflicts/overlapping access requests.  In the event of conflicting requests, or if the DTE is oversubscribed, the DTE manager will attempt to arrange a compromise acceptable to all parties.  If this cannot be done, the US DOT ITS JPO will make a final decision, based on their judgment of what is in the best interests of the overall VII program. 
4	The DTE manager will be responsible for developing and maintaining the DTE access procedures.  This will include the procedure for formally requesting access to the facility and the responsibilities of the requestor once use of the DTE is complete (e.g., tear down of the test setup.).
5	A set of usage guidelines (rules) will be developed by the DTE manager and made publicly available for all requestors.  The requestors are responsible for following the guidelines.  Failure to follow the guidelines may result in their lack of access to the DTE.
6	The existing DTE facility will be available free of charge to the requesting party.  Included in this shall be up to TBD hours of technical support and troubleshooting from the DTE manager.  If any additional support is required, the requestor will pay for those services (see next item).
7	If the requesting party requires special services (e.g., data collection, use of technical staff, etc.) as part of their use of the DTE, the requestor will pay for those services.  A list of available services and their cost/rates will be made publicly available.  All requesting parties will be charged the same for the available services.
8	The requesting party will assume all liability for damages, etc. due to their use of the DTE.  The requestor must demonstrate that they have sufficient liability insurance as part of requesting access to the DTE.  
9	The requesting party will pay for any damage they cause to the DTE itself.  If there is a dispute as to whether DTE failure is due to the DTE itself of the actions of the requestor, a third party arbitrator will determine responsibility (the requestor will pay for any damage they caused.) The DTE manager and the requestor shall agree to the decision of the arbitrator.
10	At the end of a requestor?s testing activities, the DTE must be returned to its state when the requestor?s testing began.
11	Requesters will use the DTE at their own risk.  Neither the DTE manager nor the US DOT will be responsible for any costs or damages, etc. caused by use of the DTE, nor will they be responsible for any costs caused by failure of the DTE to operate or to operate correctly.
12	If the DTE is not functioning or not functioning fully or correctly during the scheduled test time, negatively impacting the requester?s tests, the requester shall, at their request, be given 1st priority access to any previously unscheduled test capacity.  No other compensation or consideration shall be provided.
13	The manager of the DTE will respect the confidentiality of the requestor?s testing activities, and may enter into appropriate agreements to protect the requestor?s intellectual property.
14	The DTE manager will be responsible for maintaining and providing access to DTE operational and technical manuals.  The requestor agrees that neither the DTE manager nor any other party will be held financially responsible for any delays incurred due to errors in any of this technical documentation.
15	The requester shall comply with any and all rules and regulations set down by the state and local jurisdictions in which the DTE resides.
16	The requester is responsible for providing all vehicles and On Board Equipment to be used in any testing.

MEMORANDUM FOR 42 CONS/LGCB-2 
   ATTN:  Contracting Officer (Sandra. K. Turner)

SUBJECT:   Sole Source Justification, Purchase Request #F2XHC58023A001  

1. Description of the supplies and services being acquired: AU/CSAT intends to procure services to develop an operational analysis model that will enable quantitative analysis of approximately 70 technology concepts across a set of alternative future scenarios in order to produce a prioritized list of investments for a HQ USAF/CS-directed Blue Horizons study.  In addition to procuring services to develop the model, the proposed contract will leave the model as a residual product for future Air University use, and will provide training to Air University personnel on how to adapt the model for similar future studies.  

2. Justification for Sole Source: The above mentioned study is parallel to, but updated from, the Air Force 2025 Study conducted in 1996.  This paragraph explains the unique experience of the source requested, the source?s ownership of proprietary useful models, and the time criticality which prevents use of other contractors.  
   
      a. The Air Force 2025 Study contained an operational analysis very similar to that being sought for the Blue Horizons Study.  The principal model developer for that study was Dr. Greg Parnell. The initial development, testing, and application of the Air Force 2025 Operational Analysis Model was highly complex and involved approximately three man-years of work.  As a model, it broke new ground in the academic field of operational analysis, and papers on the use of value-focused thinking, based on this study, were published in academic journals by Dr. Parnell.  Last year, when the Military Operational Research Society (MORS) sought to publish a book covering the range of operations analysis, Dr. Parnell was sought as the author of the chapter on value-focused thinking, as he is considered the society?s, and thus the world?s, foremost expert on modeling of this kind.  Greg Parnell has expertise that is uniquely suited to the creation of an update version of this model.

     b. Although the U.S. Air Force does own the rights to the Air Force 2025 model, to update this model will require use of newly developed software, some of which is the proprietary property of Dr. Greg Parnell and his group ?Innovative Decisions?.  As the U.S. Air Force paid for the Air Force 2025 model, the Air Force owns rights to its use.  However, as the science of operational analysis advanced over the past 12 years, there are updates to this model that are required.  As Dr. Parnell has remained in the operational analysis field over this period, he has proprietary ownership of some of the model updates that are necessary to produce a scientifically valid and sound analysis.  As such, using Dr. Parnell and Innovative Decisions will save valuable time and money to develop the updated model.   

     c. Time is of the essence in the completion of this project, and Dr. Parnell and his associates (Innovative Decisions, Inc), are the only known group who can perform the task within the needed timeframe.  The Blue Horizons project is designed to assist the Air Force Chief of Staff and his Strategic Planning Directorate with the upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review.  The due date for the publication of the final report is August 2008.  To meet this deadline, the initial phase of operations analysis must physically begin on or before 18 March 2008.  To be ready to initiate this task in this short a time, a person or group with past experience in modeling of this type, and with the Air Force 2025 models, is absolutely essential.  Dr. Greg Parnell and his group are the only known source where sufficient expertise to meet this deadline resides.  
 
3. Justification that source is the only known source: Dr. Greg Parnell and his group ?Innovative Decisions, Inc.? is the only known source capable of satisfying this requirement.  AU/CSAT made efforts to contact all other Air Force 2025 operations analysts using the Air Force 2025 Alumni roster, Google and other internet search engines, the Air Force Global Address List, and the DoD Global Address List.  All attempts to locate others with prior Air Force 2025 modeling experience have proven unsuccessful.   

4. Actions taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions: In order to minimize the likelihood of needing future sole source justification for operations analysis models of this type, the statement of work will require that the model used for the Blue Horizons project will be left with AU/CSAT and AU/CSAT will retain rights to future use.  The statement of work will also include training for AU/CSAT personnel to operate the model for future studies.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI) for Synthetic Aperture Radar Coherent Change Detection (SAR CCD)
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is a follow-on to RFI-01-2007 issued in October 2007 by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Rapid Reaction Technology Office (RRTO), regarding a demonstration of SAR platforms in a technology comparison to collect ground truth data specifically regarding Coherent Change Detection (CCD) based on processing of SAR imagery. The data collected from this demonstration will be post processed and analyzed utilizing CCD algorithms to determine the capability and technology maturity of tactical airborne SAR CCD and its quantified effectiveness for detecting a variety of human activity scenarios. Based upon the outcome of this demonstration, a decision will made whether or not to proceed with development of a real time CCD capability to ultimately be carried aboard a small UAV. The results of this test may be utilized in the analysis and comparison of vendor technologies for possible follow-on acquisition activities. For this reason, demonstration participants will be limited to those who meet the following criteria:

- The proposed system must be an airborne radar system with a SAR imaging mode (spot or strip)
- The proposed system must operate in either X or Ku-band
- The sensor payload weight must be less than 65 lbs
- The sensor spot size must be at least 1K x 1K pixels in spot mode or provide a swath width at least 400 m in strip mode
- The sensor slant range and cross range resolutions must be finer than 0.3m when operating with FCC approved bandwidths
- The sensor must be capable of operation at a slant range of at least 3 km
- The single look noise equivalent sigma naught (NESo) of the sensor must be better than or equal to -25 dB m2/m2 at a 3 km slant range at 0.3m resolution
- The system must have demonstrated maturity, which can be shown by providing sample SAR imagery that supports claimed system specifications with RFI response
- The system must be operated on a platform and utilize navigation systems with sufficient quality to perform coherent change detection, which can be shown by providing sample CCD products or by providing specifications for the GPS/IMU that would be used in this demonstration
- The system must be available and ready to test in April 2008


Depending on the number of received responses that satisfy the above criteria, selection of participants that will be invited to participate will be based on criteria such as the maturity of the system hardware, the quality of the GPS/IMU/motion compensation unit, the potential for the system to be rapidly transitioned to a Shadow 200 or similar UAV, the suitability of the system for high volume manufacturing (if required) to meet an urgent US Government need, etc.

RRTO solicits potential performers to submit responses to this RFI via postal mail. RRTO requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the applicability of the vendor product to the concepts outlined above as well as how the proposed technology satisfies the participation criteria listed herein. In addition, RRTO requests that submittals address critical technical issues and limitations, potential system performance, weight, size, power requirements, expected robustness, and affordability of the proposed product. Completion of Table 1 (attached) is highly encouraged.

The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Responses should be limited to six pages, including Table 1. Any proprietary concepts or information should be clearly identified as such. Input on the technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by RRTO from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements. For all RFI responses an additional, non-proprietary cover page is also requested identifying your company name, technical point of contact, and contact information. RFI responses shall be received no later than 1700, EST February 27, 2008.

RFI responses shall be submitted in a commonly used electronic format and may be mailed on a CD-ROM to:

<SUBJECT>15 -- KC-10 CNS/ATM: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the Air Force (AF) 727 Aircraft Sustainment Group (ACSG), Tinker  AFB, Oklahoma for planning purposes only.  This RFI does not constitute an invitation for bids, a request for proposal, a solicitation, or a request for quote.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with the preparation or submission of the information requested.  The primary intent of this RFI is to solicit industry feedback on the viability of the planned KC-10 Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program.  A pre-solicitation notice was posted on FedBizOpps for this planned acquisition on 13 Feb 2008 (FA810608R0005).  The KC-10 CNS/ATM program is a much-reduced scope program from earlier concepts known as KC-10 AMP and KC-10 AEP.  

The KC-10 CNS/ATM requirement is to provide worldwide airspace accessibility by 2015 for the fleet of 59 aircraft.  All 59 aircraft must be completed by the end of 2015.  FAA airworthiness certification of the modification is required.  AN upgrade of the current Flight Management System (FMS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) will be required to meet the 2015 CNS/ATM requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the CNS/ATM Requirements matrix.  Given a planned contract award date of 2Q FY10, the Government is specifically interested in industry?s assessment whether accomplishing both a development and production program in this timeframe is executable.  Fiscal reality will require solutions that can be successfully executed within ACAT III program constraints.  Assume that OEM data will not be available and that an Associate Contractor Agreements may be required.  The Government requests the respondents provide a budgetary cost and schedule estimate based on the total requirments identified in Attachment 1.   

Please provide your response no later than COB 29 February 08 directly to 727 ACSG/PKA, Hugh P. Young, Contracting Officer via email at hugh.young@tinker.af.mil.  Annotate the Subject Line of the email response as: KC-10 CNS/ATM (RFI) #1 Response.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

<DESC>NASA's GSFC has a requirement for Goddard Education Series (GLES) Program. NASA's GSFC intends to purchase the items from Greystone Consulting Inc., in accordance with FAR 13.106 - Only One Responsible Source. Center Management has been looking at all of Goddard's Leadership and Management Programs.  All Leadership and Management Programs will be redesigned and will begin in 2008.  Due to favorable feedback from past participants, Center Management has decided to move forward with the next GLES class in 2008.	Each session of GLES has been overwhelmingly successful and universally received high accolades.  This will be the last time GLES will be offered as a stand-alone Leadership Program which begins April 16, 2008. The vendor of choice has already tailored their courses to meet NASA requirements and standards for the program that the class is being taught for at this time. The GLES program that Greystone designed and delivered is totally unique in the public, private, and academic sectors.	It focuses totally on leadership not on management and is integrated from beginning to end. Three critical areas bound the program - managing self as a leader, leading change and leading collaboratively. Eighteen modules have been designed to span 5 leadership focus areas: self-awareness and progressing through interpersonal competence, group leadership, organizational dynamics and environmental impacts. Each module has been constructed to integrate proprietary learning modalities into a whole that specifically addresses the unique nature of Goddard?s culture. It is a rigorous program that fully embodies the needs of the adult learner. Teaching modalities span a wide spectrum including action learning, assessment instruments, films, small group inquiry, reading and reflection, simulations, role-playing, group and individual exercises, journaling and personal coaching. Also unique are the extensive use of core learning teams throughout the course. Participants experience an intensive learning event that is profound enough to be transformative and pragmatic enough to immediately apply in their actual work environment. The course learning standard is one of trust and respect for all differences.  All subsequent learning occurs in the context of the participant?s leadership vision.   Each participant receives individualized learning and support in the form of coaching and program facilitation in recognition that successful leadership development involves both personal and organizational transformation. The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. expends considerable effort to remain current on developments in the Federal Government, NASA, and Goddard environments.  This enables Greystone to modify the program to reflect current areas of emphasis and concern while tailoring the content to the individual and collective needs of the participants. A key feature of the GLES design is class created projects that reflect the current issues and solutions that the participants feel are relevant to their daily work. Some 25 such projects have been created and presented by class participants to Goddard?s Executive Council. Given its lead role in integrating all leadership programs and in designing and implementing all of the first four ?new? GLES programs, The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. possesses unique knowledge and expertise resulting in a minimal learning curve, thus requiring the expenditure of fewer hours and dollars.  Greystone?s integral involvement with this program provides The Greystone Consulting Group, Inc. with a unique and comprehensive understanding of the program and the workshops to date.  This understanding is essential to ensuring that future workshops align with what has been taught and do not unnecessarily repeat content.  It cannot be underestimated how critically important this thread of learning is to participants of NASA and to their contribution as current and future leaders of the Center. GSFC is beginning the process of evaluating and possibly redesigning all of its leadership training programs.  Any redesigns may result in a new requirement which may be competed. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00pm local time on February 27, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated soley for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis based upon responses to this notice, is solely with the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

Therefore hand slashing is the approved  method for accomplishing the work.  We recognize that there may be alternative methods to accomplishing this work.  The contractor may request approval through the Contracting Officers Representative (COR)to utilize other methods.  In the event alternati ve methods are approved, all performance specifications remain the same, and appropriate safety and environmental considerations will be applied.<BR><BR>1.2 Performance Specifications<BR><BR>The contractor will hand cut trees and shrubs and reduce debris w ithin the treatment units depicted on the attached map and in accordance with the following specifications:<BR>	<BR>a. All deciduous trees and shrubs from 1/4 to 6 inches in diameter, measured at one foot above the base, are to be cut to a height of approx imately two feet.<BR>b. All conifer trees less than 5 inches dbh are to be cut at or near ground level.<BR>c.  Slashing debris tree and shrub pieces separated from the base after cutting will be reduced to lengths less than 72 inches and the depth of debri s will not exceed 24 inches above the ground surface.<BR>d.  All slashing debris that lands on a road surface will be removed from the road surface.<BR>e.  The contractor is not to cut down any deciduous trees and shrubs nor conifers trees within 50 feet o f any swamps, bogs, wetlands, lakes, or any permanent or temporary streams.  This includes the Reservoir itself.  Temporary streams can be identified by the occurrence of a definite bed and bank.<BR><BR>1.3 Area Description and Access<BR><BR>The terrain of  the Little Bay area varies between gently sloped to fairly steep and rugged in places.  The site can be accessed by either boat or vehicle.

Question 5:  L.10.1.h States: ?Contact information for references on contracts that have been completed and contracts that have been awarded during the past 36 months.? This appears to be conflict with the past performance instructions found in L.11 notes.  Please clarify if the following is permitted
a.Use of efforts which have been completed within the past 36 months, regardless of when they were awarded
b.Use of efforts which are currently on-going?  If so do they need to be at least a certain percent completed?
Answer: L.11 specifies that Past Performance information shall be submitted in accordance with L.10.1.h.  This refers strictly to the contact information, not past performance questionnaires. Past Performance is evaluated on work that has been completed or substantially completed within the past 36 months.

Question 6:  L.10.2 third c:  Do the labor category descriptions count against the page count for the Volume?  
Answer:  Yes.
 
Question 7:  M.4.4(a) implies that past performance responses to the government are only allowed from companies.  Will the government also accept them from government agencies?  
Answer:  Yes.  Offerors may submit past performance from any customers for which they have performed work.
 
Question 8:  Please provide an electronic copy of Section K - Reps & Certs.  
Answer:  The Government will not provide an electronic copy of the Reps and Certs.  Companies must be in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) system, at https://orca.bpn.gov/, which includes the company's information on Section K.

Questions and Answers to Solicitation number M00146-08-T-N044

Q1: Can you inform me of the specific make and model number (catalogue reference preferred) so that we may perform a closer examination of the capabilities and functionality you seek?

Answer:  The FRC East has four Nilfisk Model CD 3707EXP with modifications, NEMA rated motor starter and NEC Class II Group E motor, as characterized in the purchase description.

Q2: Can you inform us as to why you require a waste drum no bigger than 16 gallons? Our units take an industry standard DOT 55-gallon drum, and we provide the standard option of a 23-gallon drum. We can provide a 16-gallon or smaller drum, but would like to know if it is important (i.e., in the government's best interest) to go down this road.

Answer:  The units must be capable of negotiating tight production areas, therefore, the width must be below 30 inches and the drum must be emptied daily for fire protection, aluminum dust.  No more than one pound of aluminum dust may accumulate in the drums.  See NFPA 484.  

Q3. We offer the option of an automatic reverse cleaning system (as opposed to the manual control specified). 
Shall we propose this option, or is it definitely an option the government does not which to explore?

Answer:  The Government does not desire the option of an automatic reverse cleaning system.

Q4. Can you inform us when you require delivery of the 8 units? 

Answer:  Delivery is required within ten (10) weeks of award or sooner.

Q5. Will the government install the central collection system? or will this be the responsibility of the vendor?

Answer:  These will not be permanently installed central units.  These units will be portable support equipment.

<CONTACT>Daniel Hall Contract Specialist 2022083931     Daniel_Hall@nbc.gov;
<DESC>Subject:  Request for Quote (RFQ) - RFQ/Project No. NBCW8Z00629, Cost Benefit Analysis Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) is issuing this competitive RFQ to solicit Vendors for the purpose of entering into a Contract.  ACQ will conduct this acquisition using SubPart 12 and 13 under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  This requirement is for the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC).  If you are interested in this acquisition, you may participate by submitting your response in accordance with the following instructions.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. RFQ DUE DATE The due date for responses to this RFQ, both technical and price quotes, shall be via email to the following email address: Daniel_M_Hall@nbc.gov, on or before 3:30pm Eastern Time, February 25,2008  STATEMENT OF WORK for "Cost Benefit Analysis for Proposed Classification and Technical Standards" February 2008 1.	BACKGROUND  The mission of the NIGC is to ensure the integrity of gaming activities on Indian lands and to make certain that tribes are the primary beneficiaries of these gaming activities.  On October 24, 2007, the NIGC published proposed changes to the current definition of Facsimile contained in NIGC regulations, a new regulation establishing Class II Game Classification Standards, and a new regulation establishing Class II Technical Standards.   The NIGC feels that the change to the facsimile definition and the addition of classification standards regulations are necessary to clearly distinguish technologically-aided Class II games from Class III "electronic or electromechanical facsimiles of any game of chance" or "slot machines of any kind," as all of those terms are used in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. ý 2701 et seq.  Additionally, the NIGC feels that technical standards are necessary to assist tribal gaming regulatory authorities and operators in ensuring the integrity and security of Class II games and the accountability of gaming revenue. 2	OBJECTIVE The purpose of this project is to create a cost benefit analysis that will satisfy the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and to allow the NIGC to make a fully informed decision.   3	SCOPE OF WORK The NIGC commissioned an economic impact analysis of the proposed regulations.  The economic analysis concluded that the cost of the proposed regulations to the regulated community would exceed $100 million dollars annually.  The economic impact analysis did not consider the economic benefits of the regulation or the costs of not complying with federal law. The scope of the work is for the contractor to draft a report supplementing the economic impact analysis by conducting an analysis that considers the benefits and costs of the proposed regulations on the gaming industry conducted by the Indian Tribes. 4	SPECIFIC TASKS  The contractor will provide a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative cost benefit analysis of the proposed rules.  The analysis will include an examination of all costs and benefits to the Indian   gaming industry (i.e. tribal gaming operations, game manufacturers, tribal gaming regulators, etc.) that would result if the proposed rules were to take effect. The analysis will identify all data, models, inferences, and assumptions used in preparing the final report. The analysis must address the following points: 4.1 ECONOMIC COSTS 	4.1.1 Examination of federal government administrative costs and savings. 	4.1.2 The analysis will examine gains or losses in consumers or producers surpluses, if applicable. 4.1.3 The analysis will examine gains or losses in jobs, time of work, leisure, and/or commuting travel settings. 4.1.4 The analysis will include an examination of whether of proposed regulations are the most cost effective regulatory approach. 4.1.5 The analysis will examine whether the need for the proposed rules is precipitated by a potential market failure. 4.2	SOCITAL COSTS 4.2.1	The analysis will examine the discomfort or inconvenience costs and benefits, if applicable. 4.2.2	The analysis will include an examination of the benefits to society justifying the potential costs 4.3	ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS 4.3.1 The analysis will include the potential costs of not going forward with the proposed rules. 4.3.2 The analysis will identify the existence of plausible alternative models or assumptions and their implications. 5	OTHER PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS 5.1	Orientation Briefing  Within five days of award, the Contractor shall conduct an orientation briefing for the Government.  The Government does not want an elaborate orientation briefing nor does it expect the Contractor to expend significant resources in preparation for this briefing.  The intent of the briefing is to initiate the communication process between the Government and Contractor by introducing key task participants and explaining their roles, reviewing communication ground rules, and assuring a common understanding of subtask requirements and objectives. The Orientation Briefing may be performed via telephone, with the date and time will be mutually agreed.

Accordingly, the following requirements apply to this effort. (a)	Definitions. As used in this clause -- 	"Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Department of Defense (DoD) repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DoD. 	"Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. 	"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern. This 4-digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying sub-units or affiliates of the parent business concern. 	"Registered in the CCR database" means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4, if applicable, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number has been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b)	(1)	By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that it must be registered in the CCR database prior to contract award, during performance, and through final payment of any task order resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. (2)	The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS+4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (3)	Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award of a Department of the Interior task order. (4)	DoD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet.  However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days. Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c)	The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete. (d)	Following the Contractor's initial registration in CCR and receipt of any Department of the Interior award of a contract, purchase order, delivery order, task order, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement, the Contractor must directly notify the Contracting Officer of any of its changed mandatory business data in CCR within three business days of the change. (See the CCR Handbook at www.ccr.gov for the current mandatory registration data fields, or contact the CCR Assistance Center at 888-227-2423 or 616-961-4725.) (e)	Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.
