<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) intends to award a sole source contract to Chem Spray South, Inc. of Gonzales, Louisiana, to furnish certified commercial application, labor, material, equipment and certified commercial supervison to chemically control Salvinia minima at the Saint Catherine Creek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Gilliard Lake and Swamp Lake with Fluridone Liquid and Pellitized Fluridone. Areas to be controlled are as follows: Treatment area is segregated into two areas, areas accessible by airboat and areas inaccessible by airboat.  Chemical is to be applied by airboat in an estimated 450 acres of "open water" at a rate of 10.5 ounces liquid flurodine (5% active ingredient) per acre.  Chemical is to be applied through a conventional spray system, diluted to a rate of one gallon of Fluridone liquid to 50 gallons of water.  This solution should be applied in the water or directly to the floating Salvinia whenever possible, sprayed for thorough coverage. Due to dense woody emergent growth in an estimated 300 acres of the work area, access by airboat is not possible.  In order to place fluridone in these areas, palletized fluridone will be used.  Pelletized fluridone will be applied aerially with low rate flow spreader at a rate of 6.4 pounds per surface acre to water. Vendor will guarantee chemicals to be applied evenly throughout the 750 acres as per our specifications. THIS NOTICE IS NEITHER A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION NOR A SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.   A determination not to compete this proposed contract has been made Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), this requirement has been justified and approved in accordance with FAR 6.303 and FAR 6.304. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement is solely within its discretion.

Edwards AFB is where tomorrow’s Air Force is tested, and we are extremely proud of this installation, its rich history, and the role it has in the advancement of aviation. This promises to be a very special Open House and Air Show, and so that you may share in this occasion, we invite you to partner with us in this event.

The goal of this planned effort is  to develop and implement a directional networking capability that is SCA compliant, portable to a JTRS radio, and transitionable to the WIN-T and/or FCS acquisition programs.  This planned effort is to design, implement, test, characterize, and certify a directional high capacity networking waveform capability that will support both sparse (6-10 neighbors) and dense (80-100 neighbors) networks using electronically steered beam antennas or, potentially, adaptive/phased array antennas.  The technologies of i nterest that will comprise the high capacity directional networking waveform are:   Ã‚Â·	software for control/processing of directional steered beam or adaptive antennas Ã‚Â·	channel access and/or MAC layer algorithms/protocols that make efficient use of directional networking techniques Ã‚Â·	routing algorithms (both unicast and multicast) that use directional links to improve performance at the data link (LPI, LPD, packet loss rate (PLR), delay, throughput) and/or the networking level (increased throughput and reduction in ETE delay) Ã‚Â·	topology control and/or optimization techniques that may be used to control directional networking capabilities The overall program effort is envisioned to include, but not be limited to, the following: 1.  In FY04, technology feasibility assessment with estimates on performance gains achieved  2.  In FY04, design trade(s), design plan and finalization of the waveformÃ¢Â€Â™s Functional Description Document (FDD) 3.  From FY05 Ã¢Â€Â“ FY07, on-going modeling & simulation efforts to characterize and assess waveform performance and scalability 4.  In FY06, lab and/or controlled environment experimentation, with performance characterization, of 6-10 units of the waveform resident in JTRS Cluster 1 radios or equivalent  5.  In FY08, TRL-6 field demonstration of the waveform in 15-20 JTRS Cluster 1 radios, with performance characterization 6.	In FY08, SCA certification of the waveform so it can reside in the JTRS JPO library This request for White Papers is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the US Army CERDEC.  The purpose of this request is to identify potential sources that may be intere sted in and capable of performing the work described herein.  US Army CERDEC does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the use of such information. Acknowledgemen t of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of CERDECÃ¢Â€Â™s evaluation of the information received.      The white paper should address the above topic area items of interest, the envisioned program requirements, and plans for antenna/antenna technologies to support testing the waveform as a complete system.  Identified plans for antennas/antenna technologies  must be relevant to the WIN-T and/or FCS programs.  White papers shall be submitted No Later Than (NLT) 1600 on 20 Aug 2003.  It is the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s intent to review and provide feedback on the white papers shortly thereafter.  As a result of the whi te paper submission, the  government may request proposals to support an anticipated award during 1/2QFY04.  The government encourages the formation of industry teaming arrangements to ensure testability of the waveform in JTRS Cluster 1 radios and success in transitioning the fin al waveform solution to an Army acquisition program(s).  To be considered for a potential future award, any offered solutions must be SCA compliant, must be testable in JTRS Cluster 1 radios provided by the offeror or the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s team members, and m ust identify a clear and viable transition path to a major Army acquisition (e.g. WIN-T/FCS) program.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to award individual contracts to three vendors to obtain a product and support services to enable DISA to identify the off-the-shelf analyst workstation in the marketplace that best meets DISA's Department of Defense (DoD) Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT's) and Regional CERT's (RCERT's) operational needs.  The DoD Computer Emergency Response Team (DOD CERT) and the Regional CERTs (RCERTs) perform correlation and analysis of Information Assurance (IA) sensor data to support IA and computer network defense decision-making.  This enables the CERTs to execute their mission of recognizing intrusions into the Global Information Grid (GIG), and to plan responses, security policy changes, and Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) changes.  Currently, the CERTs rely heavily on humans-in-the-loop to perform this correlation and analysis. DISA plans to identify and test an automated IA sensor data aggregation, correlation, and analysis solution, or analyst workstation, capability that meets CERT requirements.  Based on the outcome of various lab and pilot tests, DISA plans to deploy this capability to the DOD CERT and the RCERTs to enable analysts to more efficiently and accurately analyze and respond to IA sensor data.  DISA invites vendors to:  (1) submit data showing how their product measures up to DISA's analyst workstation Measures of Merit (MOM); (2) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capability to be used in a pilot (an evaluation in operational environment) as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updates; (3) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capbility to be used in an operational environment as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updated.  The following documents are attached:  (1)  Solicitation DCA100-03-T-4013 includes proposal contents and certs and reps; (2) Statement of Work entitled, Analyst Workstation dated 9 December 2002; (3)  Evaluation Criteria; (4) DISA Analyst Workstation MOMs; (5)  DISA Sensor Grid MOMs.

<DESC>DESC: CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW ANNEX AT THE RICHARD SHEPPARD ARNOLD UNITED STATES, LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS, Request for Proposal (RFP)  No. GS-07P-03-UTC-0003. This notice announces the solicitation requirement for construction of the new annex onto the existing Post Office/Courthouse, Little Rock, Arkansas.  The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for construction excellence in public construction and is soliciting written expressions of interest from qualified general contractors desiring to compete in the procurement process for the referenced project. Contractors shall submit a one page letter of interest on company letter head. This letter shall include a statement of interest, DUNS number, number of personnel that will attend the Pre-proposal conference (maximum of 2) and a copy of a valid business license.  Attendance at the Pre-proposal conference is not mandatory.  Letters are due to the office of the Contracting Officer no later than August 5th, 2003.  Send letters to the attention of Pamela Lackey, Contract Officer, General Services Administration (GSA), Eastern Service Center, (7PE), Room 12A5, 819 Taylor St., Fort Worth, Texas 76102.  GSA retains the right to publish and distribute the list of offerors (bidders list) to other interested parties (i.e., subcontractors, etc.).  The annex of the courthouse will consist of approximately 155,000 GSF which includes indoor parking (approximately 24,000 GSF).  There will be some modernization/renovation and new construction work required in the existing occupied facility.  Night time and weekend work will be required for various phases of construction. The Estimated Construction Cost at Award for the project is $32,000,000 to $37,000,000.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) is scheduled to be issued on or about August 8th, 2003.  A Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit is tentatively scheduled to be held August 27th, 2003 at the project site in Little Rock, Arkansas to answer questions that offerors may have concerning the price and technical evaluation criteria. 
GSA intends to contract for complete construction services with construction contractors that offer the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project. The proposed project will be constructed in the Little Rock Commerce Business District. The annex addition will provide for eight district courtrooms, one special proceedings courtroom, three magistrate courtrooms, offices, sallyport, detention cells, and joint use GSA space, etc. Approximately fifty-two (52) secured, indoor parking spaces will be provided. Occupancy of the annex is planned for the winter of FY 2005. This procurement is advertised on an unrestricted basis. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 233320. The offeror selected shall be required to supply all labor, materials and supervision to perform the complete services as required by the Scope of Work under the resultant contract. The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value/Trade-off process.  Based on the complexity and importance of this project, the Government deems it to be in its best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror. Therefore, combined technical evaluation factors will be significantly more important than cost or price. The final price will encompass all-inclusive costs for the entire project including the administrative cost of processing change orders throughout the course of this project.  
The Government anticipates the award of a Firm Fixed-Price Contract (see FAR Part 16.202), based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government. The entire procurement process will be performed in two (2) stages. The successful offeror will be based on accumulative scores for both stages.
Stage I Submission Requirements: Request for Proposal (RFP) for technical documents from those firms responding to this CBD announcement.  Any scope changes by the Government that result from the pre-proposal conference or any other discussions may be incorporated into the Scope of Work at any time prior to the final request for price proposal submission (Stage II) at no recompense to the offeror(s).

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA  93042-5001 plans to use a Time and Material, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to procure on an other than full and open competition basis Contractor Engineering Technical Services (CETS) to various fleet and shore activities for the Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Command (NATEC) from the Lockheed Martin Corporation, 3333 Pilot Knob Rd., Eagan, MN 55121-2034.  The requirement is for CETS to various fleet and shore activities for NATEC.  This effort includes informing, instructing and training Navy Personnel in the installation, operation and maintenance of AN/AYK-10B and AN/AYK-23 Airborne Digital Computer, and a carrier-based tactical support system in support of the S-3 Aircraft Program. NATEC requires contractor engineering technical services CETS to provide on-site proficiency training, technical guidance, and information in the evaluation of unusual field problems and render technical guidance related specifically to the AN/AYK-10B and AN/AYK-23 airborne digital computer, and a carrier-based tactical support system, which interfaces with the airborne computer in the closed-loop arrangement.  The AN/AYK-10B, which is the main computer in the S-3B aircraft, has undergone extensive modifications.  The AN/AYK-23 will eventually replace the AN/AYK-10B in all S-3B aircraft.  Major updates to tactical systems are ongoing and will continue through the period of this contract.  The object of CETS is to elevate the technical skills and abilities of military and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense responsible for the operation and maintenance of the system/equipment to the level of self-sufficiency.  The effort will be performed at NATEC facilities in Jacksonville, FL.  The tasks support the organizational and intermediate levels of maintenance for the computer systems.  The OEM, Lockheed Martin Corporation, is the only source with ready access to technical databases of this equipment and is the only source with the technical support personnel capable and familiar with the systems able to perform the services including developing solutions to problems not readily resolved in the field.  No other firm possesses the required data and technical representatives with expertise on these systems. The government does not possess the required data, knowledge of equipment modifications, or engineering expertise, which precludes the use of a competitive procurement.  A ten-month base period with four one-year option periods and a final two-month option period is anticipated.  Award of a contract is expected on 1 December 2003 and the contract will continue through 30 November 2008 if all options are exercised.  The contract will include the clause at FAR 52.217-8, “Option to Extend Services”.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  Send responses to: Attn: Gary Trimble, Point Mugu Contracts Department, Code 230000E, NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, 575 “I” Avenue, Suite 1, Point Mugu, CA  93042-5049, gary.trimble@navy.mil.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) for support services involving research, development, verification, and transfer of advanced airborne remote sensing and other space and earth related technologies in support of various program areas including Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), Global Carbon Cycle Studies, and Ocean Surface Metric Measurements Measurements.  It should be noted that all field equipment necessary to support the programs, including aircraft, will be provided by the Government.  Please see the following detailed requirements: Airborne Topographic Mapper:  The ATM, and its preceding flying laser laboratory version, the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL), have been utilized as research tools to demonstrate the feasibility of performing various tasks in the areas of airborne lidar applications for remote sensing of terrain information to government agencies needing the technology.  The ATM project will require mission planning, instrument development, calibration, mission operation, and data processing and analysis to provide ice and terrain mapping data in support of programs such as the following: measurements of glacier and ice sheet topography in remote areas of the Arctic and Antarctic, including Greenland, the Canadian archipelago, Svalbard, and Alaska and other areas as the need develops; airborne coastal mapping including surveying of large tracks of beaches extending around most of CONUS and additional coastal surveys in other areas of the world that may become of interest as a result of changing focus in earth science programs; measurement of sea ice topography and freeboard including the development of methods to associate the topographic and freeboard measurements with associated sea ice thickness and subsurface morphology; mapping of other areas of geologic interest in support of earth science investigations such as volcanic features of Iceland or other sites including regions of subsidence that may result from programmatic collaboration with investigators from various institutions; high density lidar measurement of oceanic wave fields including methods to mitigate problems associated with mixed returns from the ocean surface and volume; highly precise surveys of segments of ice or land, potentially hundreds of kilometers long, for use in calibration and validation of satellite instrumentation such as the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS).  The measurement of the glaciers, ice sheets, and coastal areas will all involve the capability to repeat flight lines over the targets to establish net changes in surface morphology and height related to regional climate change (ice) and coastal processes (coastline).   Satellite data, such as from GLAS, is planned to be used to study elevation change of ice sheets by comparing both with ATM data and satellite data from earlier years.  The proper use of GLAS data will require analyses to determine instrument pointing errors, timing errors, range bias, and any other data anomalies.  Such analysis will be required throughout the satellite lifetime, but particularly after switches in satellite laser, and can involve data taken over ice and other terrain.  Analytical requirements including relating the ice sheet measurements to patterns of change in the ice sheet including rates of change and discharge in outlet glaciers, the general stability and mass balance of ice sheets and glaciers, and forecasting future rates of change in these parameters.   ATM missions utilize DoD's Satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) to derive precise aircraft trajectories essential for determination of individual laser spot elevations, and Glonass data may be added for some future missions. The ice surface measurements in particular involve large separation distances between the location of the staging airport and the survey sites, sometimes in excess of 2,500 km. ATM support requires the development of software for producing trajectories for such missions and determining the number and location (including actual position estimation) of ground tracking stations required to achieve the required accuracy.  Currently, vertical accuracy required for Greenland surveys is 7 cm, including both GPS positioning and laser pointing and measurement errors.  The ATM program has generally utilized aircraft inertial navigation systems (INS) of various types in the computation of laser pointing, but the orientation of the laser system relative to the INS varies from one aircraft installation to another and must be determined.  ATM support includes the development of efficient techniques to determine orientation parameters.  In addition, the full capabilities of a recently installed integrated GPS/INS attitude system need to be determined and exploited. Global Carbon Cycle Measurements Program:  Support for the Global Carbon Cycle Studies Program is categorized into 5 areas as follows: Airborne Oceanographic Lidar Operations; Water Leaving Radiance Modeling; Application of Water Leaving Radiance Modeling to Ocean Color Satellite Imagery;  the Development of Airborne Pump-and-Probe (PP) or Analogous Fast Repetition-Rate (FRR) Methods; and the Laser Laboratory and Calibration laboratory Development and Maintenance.  The Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL) is utilized as a tool for validation of MODIS chlorophyll biomass, CDOM/Gelbstoff (chromophoric dissolved organic matter), and chlorophyll fluorescence line height products in conjunction with planned underflights of the satellite with and without the coordination with research vessels.  In most cases the airborne laser-induced measurements cannot be directly compared to the MODIS products but must be converted into comparable units for successful satellite product validation.  The AOL is maintained by the contractor as a research tool with frequent upgrades to state-of-the-art technology.  The calibration of the AOL is an important factor in the MODIS product validation process. The AOL is generally flown along with a pair of passive hyperspectral radiometers, the Airborne Diode Array Spectrometer (ADAS) and Cosine Diode Array Spectrometer (CDAS) that respectively view the ocean and sky.  The radiance and irradiance measurements acquired with these sensors is used to develop new ocean color algorithms, validate MODIS reflectance measurements, and to trouble shoot deviations between the MODIS products and concurrent product validation measurements made with the AOL.  Instrument calibration procedures and techniques are a key factor in the success of the airborne sensor in these applications along with the preparation of the airborne spectra for comparison with the satellite reflectance spectra.  The calibrated at-aircraft ocean color radiance spectra paired with chlorophyll concentration, phycoerythrin fluorescence and CDOM absorption derived from the analytic activities are the data set for developing, testing, and improving algorithms for retrieving inherent optical properties (IOP’s) constituents from the ocean color radiance spectra.    The application of Water Leaving Radiance Modeling to Ocean Color Satellite Imagery;activities include the application of ocean radiance models developed and refined utilizing the airborne ocean color spectra to satellite ocean color imagery to produce wide-area scenes of phytoplankton pigment and CDOM absorption.  Such scenes are routinely expected to be prepared for the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) using higher density Local Area Coverage (LAC) imagery.  Extension of similar scenes to other areas or perhaps globally using lower density Global Area Coverage (GAC) imagery is part of this activity.  This activity includes the development of animated GAC and LAC imagery over periods of time from weeks, months, and even years to provide insight into seasonal and longer term changes in the surface layer IOP’s on regional and global oceanic scales. The measurement of primary productivity has become an important component of NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise.  According methods to remotely measure related parameters from an airborne platform are an important facet of the research required in the solicitation.  Specifically, the application of advanced Pump and Probe and Fast Pulse Repetition Rate methods that have been demonstrated on lab and shipboard environments to an airborne platform is sought.  Numerous obstacles to the laboratory Pump and Probe and Fast Pulse Repetition Rate methods are inherent in implementation of these methods into an airborne platform.  Careful consideration to the solution of these obstacles is a key element to the potential success of this endeavor. Laser laboratory development activities include the development of advanced techniques for measuring ions in sea water to determine the inorganic carbon content excluding dissolved CO2.	 The development of methodology to extend this capability to aircraft platforms is a component of this program.  Remote sensing measurement of phytoplankton taxonomy has been emphasized by NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise.  Techniques for remotely measuring phytoplankton taxonomy using airborne laser spectroscopy are an important component of ongoing research within the Ocean Carbon Cycle Measurements program. Ocean Surface Metric Measurements Program: This program includes the development of radar and laser capabilities for mapping ocean surface features, and includes the acquisition of precise radar and laser ranging data of both ocean surface topography as well as power spectral information derived from the ranging data.  NASA also requires the quantification of radar capabilities to perform terrain mapping as well as determining the biases associated with making ocean topographic measurements with satellite radar altimeters and assistance in expanding the ATM in conjunction with the WFF Multimode Airborne Radar Altimeter (MARA) in both the Scanning Radar Altimeter (SRA) mode, which has superseded the Surface Contour Radar (SCR), and Multibeam Altimeter (MA) mode for satellite missions such as TOPEX/POSEIDON and JASON.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 500 employees, respectively. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or before August 29, 2003 with an anticipated offer due date of on or before September 29, 2003.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The US Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Neuroscience Associates, 10915 Lake Ridge Drive, Knoxville, TN 37922 for providing histological examination of brain tissues. The contractor shall provide histological preparation of brain tissues from three experiments, two involving rate and one involving mouse brain embedding/sectioning.  EPA believes that Neuroscience Associates is the only source capable of providing the required services based on their unique multi-brain technology in which up to 16 brains  of separate animals can be simultaneously embedded, frozen sectioned throughout the entire brain and stained and their ability to provide analysis data consistent with data from previous studies.   EPA has identified Neuroscience Associates as the only source with the necessary background and  expertise to perform the required services within the prescribed time frame.  The circumstance permitting "other than full and open competition" is FAR 6.302-1,  "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  The North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710, which has a size standard of 500 employees to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to  provide evidence of the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can provide the required services may submit written qualifications fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after  the date of this publication.  Submit responses via the Postal Service to US EPA, Attn: Jennifer Hill (D143-01), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC  27711 or via courier service to US EPA, Attn: Jennifer Hill (D143-01), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page  Road, Durham, NC  27703.

<DESC>RFTOP for DNA Re-sequencing and Genotyping Administrative Coordinating Center

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health is seeking task order proposals from contractors under the NIH Public Information and Communications Services (PICS) contracts for an Administrative Coordinating Center for the NHLBI DNA Re-sequencing and Genotyping (RS & G) Program.  The overall objective of the program is to obtain reliable, rapid, and cost efficient DNA re-sequencing and genotyping to assist investigators actively engaged in elucidating the genetic components involved in the cause, variable outcome, and progression of heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases and disorders.  It is anticipated that the RS&G Program will comprise one to two laboratory centers for DNA re-sequencing, one to three laboratory centers for genotyping, and an Administrative Coordinating Center.  Under the RS&G Program, investigators from the NHLBI community will request use of the re-sequencing/genotyping service at no cost to the investigator.  An external panel of experts will evaluate the requests for caliber, interest, and feasibility for re-sequencing/genotyping.  On a regular basis, the panel will identify to NHLBI those studies recommended to receive the services during the upcoming period.  After approval by NHLBI, the laboratory centers will interact directly with the investigators to perform the requested re-sequencing or genotyping.  The Administrative Coordinating Center responsibilities will be to establish and maintain a website, advertise and market the RS & G Program to the research communities, process the requests for use of the Laboratory Centers, make effective work assignments for the Laboratory Centers, provide logistical support for the three RS & G Program committees (Steering Committee, Oversight Committee, and Evaluation Panel), and facilitate communication with NHLBI.  It is anticipated that the task order award will be cost-reimbursement, performance-based, for a period of 5 years inclusive of all options.  Performance is anticipated to begin on or about June 1, 2004.   The Request for Task Order Proposal, RFTOP-NHLBI-HV-04-12, will be available on or about August 27, 2003.  The RFTOP must be downloaded from the NHLBI website at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#rfp.  The RFTOP will also be available on the FedBizOpps site.  The due date for proposal submission is October 23, 2003.  

Competition for the task order award will be limited to those organizations holding a contract for NIH Public Information and Communications Services.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to solicit and award on a sole source basis a requirement to SAIC, 16701 W. Bernardo Drive, San Diego, CA 92127, to upgrade an SAIC manufactured Pallet Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System (VACIS)to control the pallet orientation remotely from the operator's console.  This would improve detection of threat objects.  The requirement is to be processed under 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Use of a third party vendor to perform the modification to the equipment would require CBP to negotiate the release of SAIC proprietary data or to obtain a license from SAIC to use their patented design, which is impracticable from both cost and time perspectives.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  No telephone inquiries, please.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce - International Trade Administration intends to procure services on a sole source basis  from Alexandr Filatov, Independent Directors Association (IDA), Podsosensky pereulok, 10/12, bldg. 1-1A, Moscow 103062 Russia.. U.S. Dept. of Commerce, International Trade Administration (ITA), Market Access and Compliance's Office of Eastern Europe, Russia and the Independent States (OEERIS) promotes cooperation between U.S. and foreign governments and the American and domestic private sectors for the development of a market-based commercial environment.  Recognizing the importance of accountability and transparency in the commercial environment, OEERIS has developed a Good Governance Program.  The Program's objective is to improve the commercial environment for U.S. trade and investment through joint and cooperative public-private partnerships aimed at strengthening domestic anti-corruption and rule of law efforts in order to raise standards of governance and increase civil society participation. OEERIS has identified the need to foster accountability, transparency and integrity in business and government practices through ethics and corporate governance programs as a key priority for the U.S. business community, and as a foundation for fighting corruption in Russia. 

To achieve this purpose, and as a means to facilitate a public-private sector dialogue on these issues, OEERIS has identified several projects to improve corporate governance practices and adherence to business ethics principles in Russia.  As a means to encourage the use of good corporate governance standards, best business practices, transparency, and rule of law, OEERIS, together with the Investors Protection Association (IPA) and the Russian Institute of Directors (RID), is developing a model code for independent directors and professional standards for corporate directors ("Codes").  The objective of the Codes is to develop a set of ethical standards that can be widely accepted by managers, investors, and members of the board of directors of Russian enterprises and which can be used by companies as a basis for developing codes of conduct for members of their boards of directors.  Both IPA and RID are leading Russian professional organizations whose goal is to improve corporate governance in Russia.

As a means to increase the Codes' utility and impact, OEERIS wishes to support finalization, and promotion of the Codes, including feedback from Russian experts; implementation of codes in Russian business associations, stock exchanges, unions, and chambers of commerce; and development of additional Ethics Guidelines for directors, officers, and employees.  IDA will act as prime contractor to complete the purpose and objectives of this contract, and to this end will enter into a sub-contract with RID, with RID receiving payment for half the total value of this contract for services rendered.

The overall objective shall be, in close cooperation with Russian and American experts, to finalize, promote, and implement the Corporate and Independent Directors Codes and develop additional Ethics Guidelines for directors, officers, and employees.		
OEERIS anticipates that performance of the contract  will begin on or about September 1, 2003, and will terminate on or about December 31, 2003.
Contract Requirements:

1.	Conduct 2 half-day focus group discussions.   During these roundtables, contractors shall solicit opinions of Russian and American companies, members of boards of directors, investors and managers of Russian large and medium-size companies, and NGOs and professional organizations and collect suggestions on draft codes for finalization. 
2. Complete this portion of the contract no later than December 31, 2003.
3. Develop Ethics Guidelines of corporate governance for directors, officers, and employees as an addition to the Codes.   
4. Complete Ethics Guidelines by December 31, 2003.
5. As part of the process of finalizing the Codes and Ethics Guidelines, contractors shall promote and disseminate the final texts through 3 half-day roundtables for companies and boards of directors, as well as government official represented on Russian boards of directors.
6. Complete this portion of the contract no later than December 31, 2003. 
7. Present the Codes and Ethics Guidelines to the Russian corporate sector and stock exchanges.  Develop tools to implement and monitor use of best practices put forth in Codes and Ethics Guidelines.
8.	Complete this portion of the contract by December 31, 2003
The Investor Protection Association (IPA) is a leading Russian organization that places independent directors into Russian enterprises.  IPA is the only organization in Russia that works with enterprises to improve shareholders rights and seeks to inculcate international good corporate governance principles into Russian companies.  
As a result of successful drafting of the Independent Directors Codes and numerous professional contacts in the Russian business community, IPA is in a unique position to promote and implement Codes and develop follow-up Ethics Guidelines. See note 22

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) plans to procure gene chip kits and reagents from Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA  95051.  The CDP is supporting a confirmation study of promising molecular profiles in stage I lung adenocarcinomas. The study of 600 new Stage I lung adenocarcinomas will be carried out at four academic analytical sites, University of Michigan Medical School, Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute, Moffitt Cancer Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  To ensure that the data generated using the Affymetrix Gene Chip system is comparable at the four sites, the reagents are being purchased from sole or limited lots by NCI and supplied to the analytical sites. The requested kits and reagents are for use with the Affymetrix gene chip system and can only be purchased from Affymetrix.  Use of the kits will insure that the variability in the data is minimized.  Assembling reagents to duplicate those in the Affymetrix kits would introduce unacceptable reagent variability.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on July 29, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 325413

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13, intends to purchase services on a sole source basis from Skeist, Inc . Description: Under the Clean Air Act (CAA) of 1990, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a phaseout schedule for ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs).  HCFCs are chemicals widely used in many applications including, refrigeration, solvents and foams.  Because they are potent ozone-depleting chemicals, the U.S. agreed to discontinue consumption of these chemicals in accordance with the Montreal Protocol.  HCFC-141b, a common foam blowing agent, was the first HCFC phased out of production in the U.S. (on January 1, 2003) due to its high ozone-depleting potential.  HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b, other common foam blowing agents, are also scheduled for phase out in the U.S. on January 1, 2010.  In response to the phaseout of HCFCs, the foam industry has been researching and developing alternative foam blowing agents.  Within EPA, the Office of Atmospheric Programs' Global Programs Division (GPD) is responsible for implementing the phaseout of ODSs and facilitating the transition to safer alternatives under the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program which was also established under the 1990 Amendments to the CAA. Recent Agency efforts, in conjunction with the phaseout of HCFC-141b and the HCFC Allocation Rule (68 FR 2819), generated new information on the availability and technical viability of alternatives to HCFC-141b, -142b and -22 in the insulation foam sector (66 FR 28402, 67 FR 47703, Dockets A-98-33 and A-2000-18).  Information collected by EPA to support these actions, along with public comments submitted to EPA in conjunction with these rulemaking efforts, indicates that the foam industry may face significant technical hurdles in transitioning to ozone-friendly alternatives. In order to facilitate a smooth transition and maintain energy efficiency of insulation foam products, EPA is undertaking time-critical research and analysis of HCFC insulation foam markets, end-use applications, alternative technologies, and timing of the transition from HCFCs to alternatives in each relevant end-use.  This work is essential to provide timely assistance to the foam industry to maintain energy efficiency and avert costly delays and noncompliance with the CAA and U.S. obligations under the Montreal Protocol. As GPD evaluates and manages the transition of the entire foam industry from HCFCs to a variety of alternatives, we require highly specialized technical support on a national level in the field of rigid polyurethane foam manufacturing.  The Contractor must possess:  (1) up-to-date knowledge of and extensive work experience with in-depth market research in the area of polymers and polymeric products, and (2) extensive contacts throughout the foam industry in both technical and economic areas, as demonstrated by a history of publications of multi-client surveys and reports.  Experience with surveys, research, and analysis is particularly important to complete the work outlined in the Statement of Work.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541620.  The size standard is $6 Million.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons must provide detailed information demonstrating their capability and expertise in the required skill areas outlined above. Any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data will be disregarded.  Routine requests for a copy of the RFQ will be disregarded.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, all information  received within fifteen (15) days after the publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  All questions should be directed to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at stiso.yvonne@epa.gov.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK 
For 
Insert for Spanish Language/Hispanic Newspapers and Periodicals


The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) seeks to enter into no-cost contracts for production of advertorial inserts to be published in Spanish language news periodicals or English language news periodicals targeting the Hispanic community.

The advertorials must be issued during commemoration of the agency’s 50th anniversary, between September, 2003 and September, 2004.

Background

SBA celebrates its 50th Anniversary this year and as part of the celebration will spotlight entrepreneurs from across the country. 

National recognition of the Agency’s 50th anniversary kicks off August 1 at The Dwight D. Eisenhower Library and Museum in Abilene, Kansas, where the signing of the Small Business Act by President Eisenhower on July 30, 1953 will be commemorated.  The SBA’s Web site at www.sba.gov lists the 50th anniversary events. The site will be updated regularly with new event information.  The inserts are intended to take advantage of the anniversary’s proximity to raise awareness about small business issues.

Scope

SBA plans multiple awards to contractors under which each will write, publish, and distribute a four-page minimum insert in the periodical’s circulation area.  The content of the insert must include information relevant to small businesses, tailored to local geographic interests and information about SBA’s programs and services.  The contractor must produce the insert at no cost to the U.S. government and recoup all its expenses by selling advertisements or by otherwise obtaining financial support for the project
The contractor will assign at least one person to serve as primary contact and work directly with the assigned technical representative in SBA’s Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL)to develop story ideas and content for the insert.  The contractor may use its own reporters and may also use material from other sources, for which it has obtained appropriate rights.    The contractor must submit a final mock-up of the insert, including ads, to the technical representative for SBA’s approval before publication.  SBA may edit the content as it sees fit.

The contractor is responsible for any necessary translation into Spanish.  For material prepared exclusively in Spanish, the contractor must be prepared, if necessary, to furnish English translation to SBA’s technical representative.

The contractor must receive all funds directly and pay all expenses, including any cost overruns, associated with the writing, production, and distribution of the insert.  The contractor will be responsible for all costs and logistics of creating the insert, including production, design, promotion, marketing, advertising and distribution in the markets served by contractor publications.

In addition to the writing, publication, and distribution of the insert, the contractor must print extra copies, in a number to be set out in the proposal, subject to negotiation..  The contractor must  distribute the copiesto SBA’s field offices, SCORE chapters, SBDCs, WBCs, and SBA lending partners in the publication’s circulation area.  

Requirements

The contractor need not be a publisher of a newspaper or periodical.  However, if it is not a publisher, it must demonstrate in its proposal that it has made distribution arrangements with a Spanish language newspaper or periodical, or another periodical oriented towards the Hispanic community.  .

The insert must be distributed in a news oriented print newspaper or magazine.  Periodicals consisting primarily of paid advertising instead of editorial content are not eligible.

Deliverables

The deliverables will consist of a four-page minimum insert, distributed as set out above.

Period of Performance

The contractor may propose any distribution date between September, 2003 and September, 2004.

Basis for Award

SBA plans to accept all technically acceptable proposals from responsible contractors, except to avoid duplication in a particular market.  SBA plans to award without discussions unless discussions could prove advantageous in a particular circumstance.  To avoid duplication, if SBA receives two or more approximately equal proposals covering overlapping circulation areas, it reserves the right to hold discussions and to negotiate acceptable publication dates, numbers of copies, and general areas of content prior to award.

The evaluation factors in section M of the solicitation will be used both to determine whether a proposal is technically acceptable and, if necessary, to choose among proposals in a geographic area.

SBA’s cooperation

SBA will:  
•	provide a welcome letter from SBA Administrator Hector V. Barreto for the insert; 
•	provide access to SBA officials and other personnel employed by SBA for interviews and information for the insert articles;
•	provide the contractor with use of SBA’s logo and the SBA’s 50th anniversary logo for limited purposes; 
•	permit the contractor to claim copyright in original material;
•	permit the contractor to identify itself in the insert; 
•	serve as an advisor and information source for the editorial content of the product, 
•	assign at least one staff person to work with contractor,
•	meet all production deadlines as provided by contractor,
•	identifying experts and successful small businesses as appropriate in the markets served by both the SBA and the contractor, and
•	have final approval of the final draft insert, including advertising, prior to printing.

Evaluation Factors

•	Experience of the offeror in writing and publishing similar content.
•	(If the contractor is not a publisher):  Experience of the distributor.
•	Ability of the distribution network to reach the intended audience.
•	Quality of previous publications.  (If applicable).
•	(If translating):  Experience of the translators.
•	Understanding of business issues of interest to the Hispanic community in the area to be served by the publication.
•	[If more than one in a market area and more than one proposes similar content or publication schedules]:  The ability of the offeror to reach the target audience.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The purpose of this modification is to notify potential Offerors of the cut-off date of 10:00 AM EST, 25 July 2003, for all questions, comments and concerns regarding this solicitation.  All questions, comments and concerns MUST be received, via email befo re 10:00 AM EST, 25 July 2003.  Responses to questions, comments and concerns will be consolidated and posted via this site.  All other terms and conditions regarding this solicitation remain unchanged. QUESTION 1:  We would like to know are these web based applications, client server applications, or both? ANSWER 1:  We are looking for a server side solution that integrates with Lotus Domino and that would require the client to have access to a browser (Microsoft IE 5.0). QUESTION 2:  Item # 3 of things that the 'Password Management Tool' 'MUST DO' reads; Ã¢Â€Â˜Requires no client-side softwareÃ¢Â€Â™.  We find this statement to be somewhat ambiguous.  Does this mean that once the Password Management Tool is in place, the cli ent 'Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCC-W)' has a requirement involving not having any software to utilize the Password Management Tool 'OR' does it mean that 'Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCC-W)' won't accept a Passord Management Tool that is 'installed' from vendor software? ANSWER 2:  The software will be installed on the Lotus Domino Server only.  There will be no installation of software required on the client PCs.  The Government does not want to install anything on the client PC.  The product should be seemless.  The soft ware will be installed on the server.The client PC should never know that the software has been installed.  The only thing the client side needs is Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater. QUESTION 3:  While the combined solicitation does mention a potential requirement of 12,500 seats, it does not mention any possible ordering/delivery schedule.  The combined solicitation also leaves open the area of technical set-up/installation.  Is this not to be part of the Technical Proposal or the Cost Proposal? ANSWER 3:  The 12,500 licenses will be included with the installation of the server side software - no separate delivery date.  Technical setup and installation should be included in the proposal.

<DESC>Closing date for revised proposals will remain 5 May 03.  The following questions and government response to those questions are hereby provided.

Question 1: Is it acceptable for vendors to just provide changes and clarifications to their original proposals as opposed to providing completely new proposals?  

Answer 1: All vendors have been provided an opportunity to update their proposal as a result of the changes posted in Amendment 4 of the RFP, and the discussion process.  As a result, all vendors should acknowledge their acceptance of Amendment 4 when either submitting a revised proposal or change pages to their original current proposal.  The Government requests that if possible, change pages vice a complete proposal be submitted.  In either case, as stated in the Feedback document emailed to vendors on 25 April 2003, the vendor must provide DISA with a change matrix that states which MOM scores, MOM addenda, and other aspects of their proposal have changed since their previous proposal submission.  Specific numbers of changed MOMs and their addenda must be provided.  Due to the time constraints incumbent upon the DISA evaluators, the evaluators will only evaluate those changed portions of the proposal that are mentioned in the change matrix.  


Question 2: Please clarify what components are included in the footprint space calculation.

Answer 2: As stated in the Footprint Scoring Scheme document, "The footprint scores are based on the amount of vertical space in a standard 19-inch rack that is consumed by the vendor’s proposed equipment that will be installed at one analysis facility during Phase 3.  In cases where the amount of space consumed by equipment at different analysis facilities differs, then the space consumed at the facility where the most space is consumed will be used as a basis for the footprint score.  The space consumed by the analysis consoles at the analysis facilities is not included in the footprint computations."  This means that the analysis consoles, i.e., the desktop computers and monitors with which the human analysts interact to view and respond to security events, are not included in the footprint computations.  All other components are included in the footprint computations.  

Question 3. The vendor also asks whether simply listing the hardware in their cost proposal is an adequate response to our request for footprint data.  

Answer 3.  It is not.  Section 3.3 of the vendor feedback document specifically states what they need to provide.  This is stated in Q&A format below.  

Question 4: What footprint data must vendors provide to DISA?

Answer 4: As stated in the Feedback document emailed to vendors on 25 April 2003, "The proposal must include a Phase 3 system architectural diagram that illustrates the types, numbers, and sizes of computer equipment that is proposed for installation at each of DISA's facilities.  In addition, the vendors must provide DISA the data necessary for DISA to compute the physical footprint score of your proposal using the new scoring system.  The footprint score will be based on the amount of vertical space (measured in U) in a standard 19-inch rack that is consumed by the vendor's proposed equipment that will be installed at one analysis facility during Phase 3.  In cases where the amount of space consumed by equipment at different analysis facilities differs, then the space consumed at the facility where the most space is consumed will be used as a basis for the footprint score.  The space consumed by the analysis consoles at the analysis facilities is not included in the footprint computations.  Vendors must provide DISA with specifics on rack space consumed at every location where equipment will be installed.  For example, a particular vendor might state that their solution requires 4U of rack space at each location.  This information must be consistent with the diagrams and product literature provided by vendor.   In the event that a vendor does not provide sufficient information in their proposal to determine their implementation's footprint score, then that vendor's footprint score shall be zero (the lowest score)."

<CONTACT>Barbara Janitis, Contract Specialist, Phone (703)681-0754, Fax (703)681-1211, Email janitisb@ncr.disa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to award individual contracts to three vendors to obtain a product and support services to enable DISA to identify the off-the-shelf analyst workstation in the marketplace that best meets DISA's Department of Defense (DoD) Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT's) and Regional CERT's (RCERT's) operational needs.  The DoD Computer Emergency Response Team (DOD CERT) and the Regional CERTs (RCERTs) perform correlation and analysis of Information Assurance (IA) sensor data to support IA and computer network defense decision-making.  This enables the CERTs to execute their mission of recognizing intrusions into the Global Information Grid (GIG), and to plan responses, security policy changes, and Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) changes.  Currently, the CERTs rely heavily on humans-in-the-loop to perform this correlation and analysis. DISA plans to identify and test an automated IA sensor data aggregation, correlation, and analysis solution, or analyst workstation, capability that meets CERT requirements.  Based on the outcome of various lab and pilot tests, DISA plans to deploy this capability to the DOD CERT and the RCERTs to enable analysts to more efficiently and accurately analyze and respond to IA sensor data.  DISA invites vendors to:  (1) submit data showing how their product measures up to DISA's analyst workstation Measures of Merit (MOM); (2) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capability to be used in a pilot (an evaluation in operational environment) as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updates; (3) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capbility to be used in an operational environment as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updated.  The following documents are attached:  (1)  Solicitation DCA100-03-T-4013 includes proposal contents and certs and reps; (2) Statement of Work entitled, Analyst Workstation dated 9 December 2002; (3)  Evaluation Criteria; (4) DISA Analyst Workstation MOMs; (5)  DISA Sensor Grid MOMs.

OMBUDSMAN 
 All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If the contacting officer does not satisfy your concerns, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kathy Cames, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose.  US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation.

<DESC>By this notice, during the pre-proposal conference that was held Wednesday, July 16, 2003, a question was raised that deals with page 9 in Section L and the Tab 2 requirements regarding Representations and Certifications by proposed joint venture offerors.  A question was raised and submitted in writing as follows:   Is it acceptable for the team to submit Representations and Certifications for each member firm in a joint venture if awarded one of the contracts under this procurement? 

The response was that the intent is that one set of representations and certifications be submitted for each offer and proposal, not for each firm in a joint venture.

CLARIFICATION:   Each member firm in a joint venture is to submit separate representations and certifications for each offer and proposal.  

Another question raised:  In the experience section of the proposal can we use as one of the five projects required those in which we were a major subconsultant on the team or a project subconsultant on the proposed team?

The original response was no.  It should be yes.

Also, there is a discrepancy in Representation and Certifications - K.1(a)(2) The small business size standard is $5,000,000.  CORRECTION:   small business size standard is $28,500,000.

<DESC>This sources sought synopsis is an proposed unrestricted acquisition, which is issued under Solicitation Number CS-I-03-016.  This procurement is for an analytical X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis system.  It will be used to identify the composition of solid materials that may be individual chemical compounds or complex mixtures thereof.  Such materials shall include, but are not limited to rocks, minerals, inorganic and organic chemicals, ceramics, glasses, and metals.  Samples of such materials will usually be in the form of fine powders, but they can also be in the form of wires, sheets, and irregularly shaped objects.  The system will be based on a theta-theta/theta-2theta X-ray diffractometer.

The system must also have the capability of identifying individual particles as small as 1 millimeter in diameter as well as selected areas or portions of articles that must be analyzed and identified in a non-destructive manner.  This will be done with modules that includes a 2–dimensional (2-D multiwire proportional counter) X-ray detector, a sample stage that can hold specimens weighing up to 10 kilograms and movements of plus or minus 50 millimeters in the X, Y, and Z directions.  A computer-controlled laser video alignment module will be provided for sample viewing, imaging, automated positioning in the X, Y, and Z directions, and automated system alignment.  The sample stage and laser alignment module must be usable with both the conventional as well as the 2-D detectors.  The system will include parallel beam optics accessories to minimize effects of sample position.  The X-ray optical components will be of the pre-aligned, “push-plug” type.  The operation of all modules will be integrated.

Delivery of the entire system shall be made FOB destination inside the consignee’s premises within 120 calendar days after the contract award date.  Delivery shall be made to the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection laboratory located at 630 Sansome Street, Room 1407, San Francisco, California 94111.

<DESC>NA This is a Sources Sought synopsis for the purchase of a Vertical Wind Tunnel (VWT) in support of the Military Freefall School of the United States Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School.  The Military Freefall School conducts training opera tions at the United States Army Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona which is the location that the VWT will be erected.  The following specifications outline the performance requirements. The flight chamber of the VWT must be 14 feet in diameter and able to lift a jumper with equipment, total weight 360 pounds.  The jumper must be lifted high enough off of a safety net so that he can perform basic freefall maneuvers, turns and side slides, without being tethered from above.  For safety, the airflow must be wall to  wall (no side gunnels).  Connected to the flight chamber is a staging area for ten to twelve jumpers that allows easy transition of jumpers into the flight chamber without powering down the fan(s).  The fan(s) used to lift the jumper must be mounted at th e top of the tunnel for better performance and energy efficiency.  Scheduled maintenance must be less than three total days a year and spare parts, to include fans and motors, must be easily available, less than 48-hour replacement time.  The VWT must have  a system to reduce speed or diffuse the airflow to lower a jumper that inadvertently goes to an unsafe height in the flight chamber.  The VWT must be covered and all weather capable, shielded from sun and rain.  The VWT must be easily operated, less than two hours of familiarization training for an operator.  As a part of the VWT structure, there should be 3,000 square feet of multi-purpose space for one office, one video review/ training room for 12 jumpers with retraining space for up to four individuals  to lay prone, a flight chamber viewing area, and one equipment room. The VWT should require only standard electrical inputs, 480 volts and no more than 1400 watts of power.  All interested parties are invited to provide their capabilities and estimated co st to provide the above requirement.  This synopsis is being issued for market research purposes.  We anticipate that we will develop an acquisition package and issue a commercial solicitation as a result of market information received in response to this synopsis.  We request that you provide us with any specific information that you will need to see in the solicitation in order to provide a quality proposal, such as amount of time required to develop a proposal, delivery period, need for site visit, etc.  Please forward your information and any questions concerning this synopsis to Ms. Cynthia Ford no later than 20 August 2003 at the above address or via email at cyndi.ford@yuma.army.mil or facsimile (928) 328-6849.

AFSVA will not provide reimbursement for any expenses incurred in connection with the RFI, including the costs of preparing a response, providing any additional information or attending an interview.

3.	Description. The Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA) requests information on sources capable of hosting, through a service-level agreement (SLA), hardware, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, and the communications /data delivery architecture support for the AFSVA’s shared service center (SSC). The SSC, physically housed at HQ AFSVA in San Antonio, Texas, is the centralized financial facility managing the Air Force’s Non-Appropriated Funds (NAF) accounting, payroll, and time management processes. Respondents may be single entities or teams from any combination of any Federal Department/Agency or a commercial firm (both referred to as the Firm).

4.	Scope. The scope of this RFI is to obtain information as to the feasibility of three prospective scenarios for outsourcing the hosting of ERP hardware, COTS software and the communications/data delivery architecture through a service-level agreement to determine a best value approach for migrating the AFSVA financial system to a single, shared service center environment while having the integrated applications hosted externally to the SSC.

5.	RFI Scenarios.  This information request is based on the accounting COTS application being externally hosted by the respondent or a third party contracted through the respondent.  The hosting environment requires both a test and production environment for ensuring operating system, application, and database patching will not impact the production environment. Request the respondents provide technical and costing information based on the following scenarios:


1)	Scenario 1 (Connectivity and Hardware): Respondent is responsible for operating, monitoring and maintaining data transmission medium between the hosted site and user sites. Respondent is responsible for operating, monitoring and maintaining all hardware and network operating system (NOS) performance for the web, application and database servers.  Government will be responsible for licensing the application and database.  The Government will operate, monitor, configure, and maintain the application and database software.

2)	Scenario 2 (Connectivity, Hardware and Database Management): Respondent is responsible for operating, monitoring and maintaining data transmission medium between the hosted site and user sites.  Respondent is responsible for operating, monitoring and maintaining all hardware and NOS performance for the web, application and database servers.  Respondent is responsible for licensing, operating, monitoring and maintaining the database software and instances on that server.  The Government will be responsible for licensing, operating, configuring, and maintaining the application software.

3)	Scenario 3 (Connectivity, hardware, application, and Database Management): Respondent is responsible for operating, monitoring and maintaining data transmission medium between the hosted site and user sites. Respondent is responsible for operating, monitoring and maintaining all hardware and NOS performance for the web, application and database servers.  Respondent is responsible for licensing, operating, monitoring and maintaining the application and database software.  The Government will provide configuration requirements for the application.

6.	RFI QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. Complete details on the information requested and the desired response format are posted on the AFSVA website at http://www.afnafpo.com/www-r/Calendar/CalendarOfEvents.htm. Inquiries and their responses will also be posted on the AFSVA website. Firms are reminded and cautioned that only Government contracting officers are legally authorized to commit AFSVA. All inquiries are to be directed to:

<SUBJECT>99 -- CENTER OF EXCELLENCE
<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT:
INITIAL UNIVERSITY-BASED CENTER OF EXCELLENCE
 
Background and Context
The Department of Homeland Security expects the United States academic community to play an integral role in securing the Nation.  To facilitate this involvement, the Office of University Programs, within the Science and Technology division of the Department, will establish university-based Homeland Security Centers of Excellence (HS-Centers), in accordance with the Homeland Security Act of 2002 that created the Department of Homeland Security, viz., “…to establish a coordinated, university-based system to enhance the Nation’s homeland security.”   The purpose of these Centers is to provide a locus to attract and retain the nation’s best and brightest academic scholars in pursuit of homeland security related disciplines.  The HS-Centers are envisioned to be an integral and critical component of the new “homeland security complex” that will provide the nation with a robust, dedicated and enduring capability that will enhance our ability to anticipate, prevent, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks.  
 The HS-Centers will be mission-focused and targeted to research areas that leverage the multidisciplinary capabilities of universities and fill gaps in our needed knowledge and our ability to counter terrorist attacks and enhance the overall security of the nation.  The HS-Centers will complement other programs within the Department (including the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency) and in other federal agencies that fund projects-focused research aimed at the development and deployment of specific homeland security technologies and capabilities.  The selection of the HS-Centers will be coordinated with other federal agencies to minimize duplication of effort and maximize coordination of expertise and resources.
 
Call For White Papers
The Department intends to establish University based HS-Centers across a spectrum of short ranged and longer ranged mission-focused research and development areas.  Likely areas of support include but are not limited to, risk-based economic modeling on the impact and consequence of terrorism, behavioral research on terrorism and countermeasures, public safety technology transfer, agro-terrorism countermeasures, and research and development of needed response technologies and operations.  Over the next several months, the Department will solicit additional white papers through a series of Broad Area Announcements (BAA) for a number of HS-Centers.  This initial round is soliciting white papers for the first HS-Center, to be awarded in accordance with the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by November 25, 2003. 
 This solicitation is for a HS-Center focused on risk-based modeling, with a particular emphasis on economic aspects, to better understand the impact and consequences of terrorism and to provide decision-makers with validated tools to evaluate countermeasures and response actions.  The HS-Center will provide tools and expertise in modeling and simulation to support risk analysis, with the goal of developing predictive tools to assess vulnerabilities and potential responses to attacks to the Nation’s critical infrastructure.  The HS-Center will also provide policy-informed economic modeling and prediction, to identify the costs and benefits of alternate countermeasures and operation responses aimed at enhancing the security of individuals and systems.  These areas are drawn, in part, from the National Research Council Report of 2002, “Making the Nation Safer: The Role of Science and Technology in Countering Terrorism” located at http://www.nap.edu/books/0309084814/html/.    
 
White Paper Requirements
White papers should total no more than eight single spaced pages in 10pt font, including an executive summary and any attachments (all sections are required).  Section I (1 page maximum) should describe the composition and extent of participation of contributors to the proposing group, including other colleges and universities, national laboratories, industry, and state and local government.  Section II (1 page maximum) should identify and justify the advantages of citing the HS-Center in a particular region of the country and at the lead institution.  Section III (3 pages maximum) should describe the technical work plan of the lead and participant institutions; available relevant capabilities that can be applied or leveraged to meet the mission; and mechanisms for transitioning the research into operation capabilities.  Specific examples of direct relevance to homeland security should be used to validate the technical work plan.  If economic modeling, analyses and predictions is proposed as the predominant research area, then creative approaches to apply findings to the short and long term impact of attacks on national or local infrastructural assets such as energy, food and water would be an effective and compelling example.  Similarly, if complex system modeling will be a focus of a Center’s activities, the work plan should include specifics of how evaluative approaches will be developed to identify and marshal needed resources to respond to varying levels of attacks, either to people, infrastructure, natural resources or combinations of these.  Of course, proposing groups are welcome to suggest derivative approaches and other examples in areas responsive to either or both of these interrelated identified themes.
Section IV (2 page maximum) of the white paper should describe the proposed management plan and organizational model for the HS-Center, and a top-level budget estimate that identifies allocation of funds across the center membership, and allocation to key activities, including management.  This section should present two options corresponding to funding levels at the $2M and $4M level per annum, for an initial three year funding cycle.
 
Submission and Evaluation of White Papers
White papers are to be submitted electronically and must be received by 4:00PM, Eastern Standard Time, 11 August 2003. Those planning to submit white papers can go to the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) site at http://www.orau.gov/dhsuce, for instructions, guidelines for submission procedures and details, and queries of a more substantive technical nature. The white papers will be reviewed and evaluated by a team of external independent experts.  The external expert evaluation team will provide their recommendations to the senior management of the Science & Technology division.  Based on these reviews, invitations to the top candidates will be made by 6 September for full and detailed proposals.  Detailed instructions on preparation requirements will be provided at that time.  Completed proposal will be due by 1 October. A limited number of site visits will be made in early November. 
The purpose of this request is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The Department of Homeland Security does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the use of such information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Department of Homeland Security's evaluation of the information received.  As a result of the white paper submission, the government may issue a request proposals to support an anticipated future contract award.
The white papers will be evaluated based on their ability to demonstrate:
1.	Innovative and topic-related research directly related to advancing homeland security.
2.	Importance and effectiveness of proposed partnerships.  
3.	Established personnel and physical infrastructure that can be leveraged to successfully undertake the proposed research.

This notification serves three purposes:  1) To notify potential offerors of the Governments intent to solicit a brand name only component under a future construction p roject 2) To identify potential sources that can provide the brand name only item and 3) Notification of the Governments intent to brand name specify only Kitledge Tapestry granite from Fletcher Granite Company, LLC, as described below. In the event there are no sources other than Fletcher Granite Company, LLC, a subsequent market survey will not be published in support of a Justification and Approval (J&A) for sole source for the granite.  The Tapestry granite is embedded in the construction project that w ill be issued competitively.  Only that part of the project requiring Kitledge Tapestry granite mined by Fletcher Granite from the Milford, NH quarry is sole source if no sources are able to provide an approved equal material.  Suppliers will be providing granite to the contractor under the future solicitation for the construction of the project, not directly to the Government.  In the event no equal material exists, the brand name only justification will be issued pursuant to FAR 6.3, Only One Responsible Source. SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT:  The project includes brand name only granite material for interior and exterior stone cladding.  Approximately 4,500 square meters (47,500 square feet) of 5-inch thick Kitledge Tapestry granite will be required.  The Kitledge Tapes try granite has been identified as the only acceptable granite that will meet historic design considerations for this project. The building site for the new Library and Learning Center is located on the historic plain of the West Point US Military Academy (USMA).  The main cantonment portion of the USMA campus adjacent to the Hudson River was designated a National Historic Landmar k (NHL) District in 1960.  The Plain is the focal point of the NHL District.  Coordination with the New York State Historical Preservation Office (SHPO) has been ongoing to address concerns on the impact to the visual resources of the Plain.  During the in itial planning and design stages of the project, the visual landscape context, including building design elements and materials were chosen to speak to the existing historical visual resources.  The use of granite stone cladding was considered paramount to  address visual concerns.  Further, the use of the Tapestry granite to match the cladding of surrounding buildings is considered to be as equally important in providing the association to the surrounding historic properties. As viewed from Cullum Road, the Plain is currently framed by five structures:  the existing Library, Bartlett Hall, Eisenhower Barracks, Washington Hall, and McArthur Barracks.  Eisenhower Barracks, The Plain elevation of Washington Hall, and McArthur Barr acks were all constructed in the 1960s using the Kitledge Tapestry granite.  These three (3) buildings provide examples of the desired effect of the variegated stone cladding. In accordance with the National Building Granite Quarries Association, Inc. color classifications of granite and ASTM C 119, Terminology Relating to Dimension Stone, the Kitledge Tapestry granite has a color designation of gray, is variegated gray, pink/bl ack, and has a uniform medium grain. The following items must be submitted: 1) Stone samples for verification:  A minimum of three (3), not less than 12-inch (300 mm) square samples showing the full range of variations in appearance characteristics expected; 2)  Source certification:  Provide a certification statement that stone is available from a single quarry (sourc e) with resources to provide sufficient materials of consistent quality in appearance and physical properties.  The final appearance shall be consistent with the desired random irregular variegated patterning seen on Eisenhower Barracks, The Plain elevatio n of Washington Hall, and McArthur Barracks.  The irregular patterning of the variegated tapestry stone is difficult to describe and not easy to sample; therefore, it is recommended these building be inspected to see the desired end effect of the stone cla dding. 3)  Stone test reports:  Provide test data indicating compliance with physical properties according to ASTM C 615, Standard Specification for Granite Dimension Stone.  Testing shall have been performed on specimens representative of minimum thickness and f inish of installed stone, in both wet and dry conditions.  Testing shall have been completed within the past five (5) years.  The testing agency shall be qualified in accordance with ASTM E 329 as documented in accordance with ASTM E 548. 4)  Application examples:  Provide at least three (3) buildings and/or structures where the proposed stone has been used.  Include the address of the building and/or structure and an 8 x 10-inch color photograph showing the full range and variation that ca n be expected from the stone source.  The photo can be either a hard copy photograph or a digital image (jpeg file).  If the proposed stone has not been used on a completed building or structure, an 8 x 10-foot mock-up of dimension stone, constructed at th e quarry site will be acceptable.  The cost of the mock-up will be borne by the supplier with no expense to the Government.  The address and a photograph as described above shall also be provided for the mock-up.  The Government, and designated Government Representatives reserve the right to inspect the buildings, structures, and/or mock-ups. Any supplier wishing to provide granite material that is compatible with or comparable to the Kitledge Tapestry granite must provide the items listed below, and any other data no later than 7 August 2003 to Shaukat Syed, US Army Corps of Engineers, New Yor k District, Contracting Division, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1843, New York, NY, 10278-0090.  This is a market survey only.  This is a notification of the governments intent to brand name specify a component of a future project.  The government does not intend  to solicit this component as a stand alone independent contract action.  This is not a request to respond to a solicitation.  This project will be solicited at a future date.  Points of contacts:  Shaukat Syed, Contract Specialist, telephone:  212-264-670 7, fax:  212-264-3013 and Jeff Friese, Design Project Manager, telephone:  845-938-2116.

Background

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) produces the Benchmark Input-Output (I-O) Accounts of the United States.  These accounts form the basis for BEA's estimates of how industries provide input to, and use output from, each other to produce Gross Domestic Product, or GDP.  The Benchmark I-O estimates provide the foundation for other estimates throughout BEA, contributing particularly to the National Accounts.

Purpose

The Benchmark I-O Accounts of the United States are based primarily on data collected from the quinquennial Economic Censuses by the Bureau of the Census.  While there is a tremendous amount of data available from the Economic Censuses, these data are not complete for all industries.

An important gap in data coverage by the Economic Censuses for the year 2002 exists for the expenses of electric and gas utilities.  This means that little information is available on the quantity and value of goods and services used to produce and distribute electricity, and on the quantity and value of goods and services used to transport and distribute gas.  These data are needed to provide accurate and complete estimates of the expense structure of the electricity and gas utilities industries in the U.S. economy.  This information would lead to greatly improved benchmark I-O estimates of intermediate purchases for electricity and gas, as well as improved measures of the value added of these industries.

Scope of the Work

The vendor will provide BEA with expense ratios for gas and electric power generating, transmitting and distributing industries by form of ownership.  The industries for which these data will be supplied follow the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industries for electricity and gas:

"	Hydroelectric power generation 		(NAICS 221111)
"	Fossil fuel electric power generation		(NAICS 221112)
"	Nuclear electric power generation		(NAICS 221113)
"	Other electric power generation		(NAICS 221119)
"	Electric bulk power transmission and control	(NAICS 221121)
"	Electric power distribution			(NAICS 221122)
"	Natural gas distribution			(NAICS 221210)
"	Pipeline transportation of natural gas		(NAICS 486210)

Expense ratios for electric power marketers and brokers in NAICS 221122 are also to be developed by the vendor.
For each NAICS industry, the following expense ratios of expenses to gross receipts for calendar year 2002 are to be supplied:

<DESC>The Government intends to issue and negotiate a sole source firm-fixed price contract with KASPAR Electroplating Corp under FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider capabilities of other interested parties if received within seven days of this publication synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The proposed contract action is to provide, install and upgrade the Alodine wastewater transfer module at the Randolph AFB. The intended work is described in the statement of work and scope of work:

ALODINE WASTEWATER TRANSFER MODULE
STATEMENT OF WORK

·	The transfer module proposed for the Randolph Air Force Base Alodine pre-treatment system will consist of a commercial, 36”x44”x38” high polypropylene tote with a nominal capacity of 250 gallons in a metal cage with plastic base. The tote will be further enclosed in an open-top 41”x56”x38” welded 14-gauge stainless steel box with no penetrations or drains.
·	A 1” air-operated diaphragm pump will be mounted above the tote and permanently plumbed to the tote’s bottom discharge valve. The pump will be equipped with pressure and flow regulators and a simple output pulse damper. A multitude of valves on the suction side of the pump will allow source selection from the tote, the secondary containment, or the generating building trench. A single hose will be used as the suction hose from the trench and as the discharge hose to the Alodine equalization system, and permanent hose end connections will be provided to mate with the Alodine system.
·	The entire module will be on a substantial steel base with channels for movement by forklift. The channels will be designed so that the forks are captive to prevent tipping during transport.
·	The empty weight of the module will be approximately 630 pounds and the full weight (with 250 gallons) an estimated 2715 pounds.
The operating concept is to locate the module adjacent to the trench in the refinishing hangar, connect the air supply and suction hoses, and draw the water from the trench into the tank. When the tank is filled or the trench is empty the air supply hose will be disconnected and the suction hose moved to the discharge port and coiled on the system within the secondary containment perimeter. The module will be transported by forklift across the runway apron to a point adjacent to the Alodine equalization vessel(s). The discharge hose will be connected to the equalization inlet at a point within the secondary containment system of that vessel and the water transferred. The system will then be disconnected and returned to the refinishing hangar for the next volume.

Specifications
For the Upgrade
Of the
KASELCO Electrocoagulation and Filter Press Units


SCOPE OF WORK:

Construct a secondary containment area with a capacity of 90 cubic feet and coated with chemical-resistant epoxy. The area will be constructed between existing expansion joints to avoid future shifting and potential leaks. The floor will be overlain 4" so that the floor and walls are continuous, with no joints. The area will have no drain penetrations and the floor will not be significantly sloped.

The reaction system will be modified by the addition of a single pressure switch that monitors pump discharge pressure. The absence of a minimum pressure or retention of a medium pressure will indicate flow failure. The switch will sense each stroke of the pump, resetting a timer with each signal. If the timer reaches its adjustable, set time without resetting, the controls will stop the rectifier and pump. The pressure switch and pump air solenoid will operate using the existing, internal 120 volt signal in the rectifier. The controls will be housed in a new, fiberglass control panel added to the rectifier face or side.

Two 500 gallon, cone-bottom, closed-top polyethylene tanks (KASELCO P/N TA05004885CO-A) will be installed within the secondary containment area. The 1" input line will be plumbed to the top of these tanks with a selection valve for each tank. Each tank will have a removable, internal screen to remove foreign matter that could affect system performance. Each tank will be fitted with a single 1" decant port with valve in the sidewall above the cone. Decant ports will be plumbed to drain to the existing sewer sump.

Each tank will also be fitted with a return line from the Electrocoagulation unit's valve tree and a suction line from the bottom of each tank to the suction ports of the Electrocoagulation unit. The same port at the bottom of each tank will also be connected to the filter press by way of selector valves.

The KASELCO Electrocoagulation reactor unit will be relocated to a position near the vessels. It will be re-plumbed as mentioned above, using flexible lines identical to those used within the system where necessary. 

The KASELCO filter press will also be relocated to a similar position and similarly connected to the sludge lines.

The system will be installed by KASELCO personnel, using Synergistic Environmental Systems to install the secondary containment and with material handling (lift equipment) by unspecified persons. The system will be tested for fluid integrity using water supplied by the paint hangar. One day of operator training will be provided.

EQUIPMENT AND TASKS REQUIRED:
·	Construct secondary containment basin as discussed above
·	Approx. 20' 1" flexible PVC
·	Approx. 20' 1" Schedule 80 PVC
·	Approx. 4ea 1" Schedule 80 PVC ANSI flanges
·	Connectors and fittings, various, 1" and 1/2"
·	2 each TA05004885CC-A
·	2 each screen, stainless steel, removable
·	Approx. 60' ½" Schedule 80 PVC pipe with 4ea Spears ¼-turn true-union valves and various fittings
·	Installation (5 days)
·	On-site KASELCO engineering management 
·	6 days travel @180 miles per day
·	Training (1 day)
·	Operator's manual modifications
·	Parts manual modifications
Automatic shutdown equipment and installation

The applicable NAICS is 332813 and small business size is 500 employees. The magnitude of this contract action is between $30,000.00 and $40,000.00.
