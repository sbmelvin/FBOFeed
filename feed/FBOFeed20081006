By law 6 of these Public members must be people with disabilities. There are 12 Federal members designated by statute. These are assistant secretaries from major Federal agencies such as the Department of Justice, Department of Transportation, Department of Defense, Department of Health and Human Services and the General Services Administration. The Board meets five times a year in Washington, DC. It needs hotel meeting space and sleeping rooms for about 14 Board members from outside of Washington. The meeting dates are set in the Board's regulations, and can only be changed with the consent of the Board under extreme circumstances.</p>

Therefore, our Board has authorized consideration of alternate dates in July, if accommodations are not available during the dates specified above. Alternate dates which will be considered include meeting dates on any three sequential weekdays within the month of July 2009. Proposals which include dates other than the preferred dates must specify dates of availability for both sleeping rooms and meeting space.</p>
<p>Hotel Requirements -- The Access Board requires a hotel that has availability on the meeting dates above and can provide a Meeting Room, Audio-Visual Equipment, Food &amp; Beverage Service, and 14 Sleeping Rooms (of which 6 shall be wheelchair accessible sleeping rooms.)</p>
<p>The Access Board staff must be able to make a site visit to the hotel to determine whether or not it meets the accessibility criteria, design criteria, and other requirements.</p>

<DESC>TITLE:  Market Survey for Center Operations & Maintenance - Eight Major Trade Areas, for the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ
The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (Tech Center) has a continuing requirement for services that were previously procured on a single contract, DTFACT-04-C-00014, awarded to All Star Services, Inc.  This contract expires on September 30, 2009.  One of the FAA's fundamental procurement principles is to provide attainable and reasonable opportunities for small businesses.  This announcement seeks to survey and assess the current marketplace for small businesses that are capable of performing any one of the eight major trade area services listed in Table 1, attached.  
This market survey will aid the FAA in determining whether adequate competition exists to set aside any of the requirements, listed on Table 1, for small business when the RFO follows. Responses to this announcement will be used to determine competition level and whether sufficient competition exists to set aside any of the eight major trade requirements for small business, for small, economically-disadvantaged (SEDB) firms; Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) of for very small businesses.  
Background:  Work to be done at the Tech Center covers 5000 acres, includes approximately 125 buildings, utility distribution systems, motor vehicles, and roads and grounds.  The Center contracts out nearly all its facility operations and maintenance work to private contractors, except for a small amount of work done by the Center's in-house shops.  
The current contract is a hybrid contract of fixed price work (namely operation and maintenance of the central utility plant and water treatment plant, scheduled preventive maintenance and servicing of installed equipment--approximately 15,000 items), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) time and materials and cost-plus fixed fee (such as for emergency repair of storm damage, or trash and hazardous waste removal and disposal).  Included in separate contracts and not part of this market survey are custodial/janitorial services, security guards and cafeteria operations.
The Center's COMS contract includes servicing of some of the tenant-owned facilities located on the campus.  Servicing of facilities owned and paid for by others is distinguished from Center facilities, and financed by the tenants.  Full servicing is currently provided for the FAA's Eastern Region Air Traffic Control Tower, Transportation Security laboratories and the Federal Air Marshall's training and administrative facilities; selective servicing is performed for the US Coast Guard and NJ Air National Guard.
The complete announcement is attached.Also attached are the Business Declaration Form and Table 1.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for engineering development and associated analysisactivities within the areas of guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) systems andintegrated avionics systems. The support required includes GN&C effort for the Orion andAutonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) Projects, and consists of CrewExploration Vehicle (CEV) Rendezvous, Proximity Operations and Docking, CEV Deorbit andEntry Guidance, CEV Integrated GN&C Design Requirements and Fault Detection, Isolationand Recovery, CEV Flight Control Development and Analysis, Linear Covariance (LinCov)Analysis, Systems Engineering Co-Lead for ALHAT, and Autonomous Flight Manager (AFM) andGN&C Software Development and Integration. These activities will support two near-termOrion Project milestones, Preliminary Design Review (PDR) scheduled for 1QFY09, andCritical Design Review (CDR) scheduled for 3QFY10. These activities also support thematuration of an autonomous lunar landing GN&C and sensing system for the ALHAT Projectto Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 6 in support of the Altair Project PDR.NASA/JSC intends to purchase these services from the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory,Inc. (Draper) through an increase to the current Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity(IDIQ) ceiling of $18.9 million under contract NNJ06HC37C. The estimated value of theincrease is $7 million which increases the total ceiling to $25.9 million.  The end datefor this contract is September 30, 2010. The CEV to ISS proximity navigation designs are largely derived from the Shuttle to ISSexperience.  Contractor personnel who were key contributors to the development andmaintenance of the Shuttle capability are making core contributions to the definition ofthe algorithms and development of requirements for the CEV. The ISS rendezvous guidancedesign being implemented on CEV is a dual co-elliptic approach developed and analyzed bythe contractor. The contractor is responsible for the algorithm design and iscontributing to the CEV implementation and analysis.  The contractor is also supportingthe development, refinement, and understanding of the rendezvous guidance algorithmsbeing implemented on CEV. Draper has developed an embedded MATLAB prototype of thedeorbit guidance and has integrated it into NASA and prime contractor simulations. Drapers familiarity with the algorithms and prototype are critical to the on-timedelivery of the deorbit guidance flight software artifacts. Draper is also developing theEntry Guidance algorithms and architecture for CEV. Under this contract, Draper has beenworking as the lead for developing and integrating the AFM and GN&C software for powereddescent and landing as part of the ALHAT Project. Draper is also responsible forsupporting systems engineering documentation, development and technological maturation ofan integrated, autonomous lunar landing GN&C and sensing system to support crewed, cargoand robotic lunar landing in support of the Constellation Program (CxP). Draper iscurrently performing the above work under this contract and has the critical knowledge tohelp achieve the Orion Projects PDR and CDR on schedule.The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this actionfalls within Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  6.302-1 (a) (2) (iii), Only OneResponsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements,pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(d) (1) (B), services may be deemedto be available from only one source for the continued provision of highly-specializedservices when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptabledelays in fulfilling the Agencys requirements.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontract! ing plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 3 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contract per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and HBCU/MI, 3% each to HUB Zone SB, VOSB and SDVOSB.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 09 subcontracting targets in term of dollar ! value of subcontracts are 77.51% to SB, 16.18% to SDB, 14.53% to WOSB, 1.42% to HUB Zone SB and .14% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FA! R) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.   Refer to FAR Clauses 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) and 52.204-8 Annual Representations and Certifications (Jan 2005).  The selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract.  This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility studies, environmental assessments, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.  The prime firm and consultants for this contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term.  A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a completed Standard Form 330, Architect Engineer Qualifications.

NUWC Div. Newport, RI has an existing contract, N6660408M1478 with D.G. Obrien/Teledyne for 49 ea. P/N 2983.2.012 Header Assemblies identified in Electric Boat Specification 2983.  NUWC intends to modify the existing contract to add an additional 49 ea.  NUWC is the repair depot for Missile Tube Penetrators, in which these items are an integral part, and an unexpected increase in repair items have been received.  As the current contract is already in production, delivery of the additional quantity would be expedited by avoiding several weeks of production set-up.

A.  BACKGROUND

Ethiopia is the second most populous country in sub-Saharan Africa, with a 2005 population estimated at 78 million people from 83 ethnic groups and languages, in an area almost twice the size of Texas.  There are nine ethnically based regions and two special administrative areas, one of which is the capital, Addis Ababa.  Approximately 4% of the population lives in Addis Ababa and another 11% in scores of much smaller urban areas throughout the country.  Approximately 85% of the population lives in rural areas.   Religion plays a major role in the lives of most Ethiopians:  approximately 40%-45% of the population adheres to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church; approximately 45% of the population is Muslim; and Evangelical and Pentecostal Protestantism constitute more than 10% of the population.  To date there is remarkable religious tolerance and harmony. 
 
The national adult HIV sero-prevalence for 2005 is estimated at 2.1%, with a 7.7% urban rate and a 0.9% rural rate.  HIV in Ethiopia continues to be primarily urban, with wide variation in rural areas.

<DESC> 
Overview

The PEPFAR/Rwanda Interagency Coordinator reports to the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) in Rwanda, and will assume responsibility for coordinating critical communications between and among various USG departments and agencies (CDC, DOD, USAID, State and Peace Corps) involved in the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in Kigali, Rwanda. The Ambassador heads the PEPFAR program and is the final decision-maker with input from the Senior Management Team (SMT), which is comprised of the DCM, Agency and Department Heads and Deputies (or designees). Supervision and annual evaluation of the coordinator is assigned to the Deputy Chief of Mission with consultation and input from other USG departments and Agencies Directors. 
 
Background

PEPFAR is the largest commitment given by a nation toward an international health initiative for a single disease. In the first phase, it obligated more than $18 billion over five years through a multifaceted approach to combating the disease in more than 100 countries around the world. The strategy placed an intensified approach on 15 focus countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia that represent approximately half the worlds infections (Rwanda is among the 15 focus countries). The goal of the first phase of PEPFAR is to treat 2 million HIV-infected individuals, prevent 7 million new infections and to provide care and support for 10 million HIV-infected individuals and orphans. In Rwanda, PEPFAR is implemented by five US government agencies:  the US Department of State (DOS), the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC), the Department of Defense (DOD), and Peace Corps (PC). 

Rwanda is the most densely populated country in Africa and has a population of ~9 million.  The national adult HIV sero-prevalence is estimated at 3% (DHS 2005) with a higher prevalence in urban (7.3%) than rural (2.2%) areas. Because Rwanda is a small country where movement is quite easy, there is a risk of increased prevalence among the rural population due to the ease of interaction between urban and rural populations.  Women have a higher prevalence (3.6%) than men (2.3%).

Working under the direction of the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), the incumbent will oversee and coordinate the activities of the USG PEPFAR Country Team in planning and implementing the PEPFAR program. In addition, s/he will be responsive and accountable to the PEPFAR Rwanda Senior Management Team (SMT). The SMT is comprised of the DCM, Department and Agency Heads whose role is to provide broad policy and strategic direction for implementation of the Emergency Plan, including compliance with guidance and earmarks from the OGAC as well as maximum congruence with priorities of the host government.

General Principles

-   Rwanda does not currently have an Interagency PEPFAR Coordinator.  As envisioned, the incumbent will be the primary point of contact with the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) and will be the coordinator of activities related to the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (the Emergency Plan/PEPFAR) in Rwanda. The PEPFAR Coordinator will play a critical role in the planning, implementation, and reporting of program performance of inter-agency programs. 
-   The Ambassador heads the in-country PEPFAR program and is the final decision-maker under PEPFAR Guidance to all program plans and activities submitted to the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator.
-   The Coordinator will be a facilitator, a communicator, and a negotiator. The Coordinator will not be a technical director, although the Coordinator may be expected on occasion to ensure follow-up on implementation of technical recommendations based on the Country Operational Plan (COP) and other performance review information. 
-   The Coordinator will be accountable to ensure the SMT is achieving its objectives and will work with the SMT to collect agenda items for weekly meetings, take notes during weekly meetings, identify action items and ensure follow-up of these items.   
-   Interagency Technical Working Groups (TWGs) exist and are led by technical members of the PEPFAR team.  The TWGs report directly to the PEPFAR Interagency team. The Coordinator, in collaboration with Agency leads, is accountable to ensure that these groups are established, have an agenda and are achieving objectives.
-   Agency heads should be copied on communications between the Coordinator and TWGs or staff as well as on substantive communications between the Coordinator and the OGAC core team lead. This procedure is essential to retain trust and respect between agency heads and the Coordinator. In addition, it is important that the Coordinator be copied on relevant communications related to matters of PEPFAR program strategy, implementation, and management and staffing.  
-   The Coordinator will not generally engage in policy discussions with Government of Rwanda (GOR) officials.  This role is reserved for the DCM and Agencies Directors or their designees.  Rather, the coordinator will support the senior management team to prepare for meetings with GOR officials, accompany (if requested) and facilitate ongoing communication and follow-up with appropriate GOR counterparts.  
-    The Coordinator will have the lead in preparations for the COP, Semi-Annual Performance Review (SAPR), and Annual Performance Review (APR) development.
-    The Coordinator will be responsible for ensuring that reports are submitted to Washington in time, for organizing the logistical arrangements for inter-agency work, and for keeping agencies on task for inter-agency efforts.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

SUPERVISION:
The Senior Advisor will receive general guidance from the NAS Director or Acting Director.  As a recognized authority in financial and organizational management programs and issues, the incumbent will receive only administrative and policy direction concerning overall program priorities and objectives.  Specific assignments frequently originate out of the liaison activities of the work, and the incumbent independently negotiates the draft scope and objectives of projects with little input or review by his/her supervisor.  Since the incumbent is physically located in Bogota, he/she will exercise considerable independent judgment in developing new and improved approaches in analyzing and reviewing NASs programs in Colombia.

<DESC>The Pacific Northwest Regional Office of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation intends to award one indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) Architect-Engineering services contract for assistance with planning, Project Management (PM), and Construction Management (CM) for the upcoming Grand Coulee Dam Third Power Plant Unit Overhaul, Grand Coulee WA. The principal NAICS code for the requirement is 541330.  The unit overhaul project will involve overhauling turbines (Units G-19 through G-24) that have been in service since the mid 1970's. Units G-19 through G-21 are equipped with 820,000 HP Francis-type turbines, designed by Dominion Engineering Works, Ltd., and manufactured by Willamette Iron and Steel Co with a runner throat diameter of 34 feet. Units G-22 through G-24 are equipped with 960,000 HP Francis-type turbines, designed and manufactured by Allis-Chalmers with a runner throat diameter of 32 feet. The condition of the six units is such that a complete overhaul of the units is necessary to ensure continued operation. The planned overhaul includes work on the generator, turbine, shaft, and the auxiliary equipment. There are many work items to be completed prior to beginning the overhaul work.  These include: replacing the 500kv cables with overhead lines; modifying the fixed-wheel gate chamber to accommodate blasting and painting; rehabilitating all power plant cranes; design and construction of a material storage building; work on the draft tube platform; testing for asbestos and lead paint; identifying safety equipment and procedures for the various projects; coordinating any permits required for the projects; developing hazardous waste handling requirements and procedures; and, planning the acquisition of services and components in such a way as to minimize unit outages. At this time Reclamation contemplates performing some of the preliminary work with Government forces and some through the award of contracts. The successful offeror for this ID/IQ contract will need to have extensive expertise in the comprehensive planning and management of large multi-phase, multi-discipline, infrastructure projects. The contractor will need to have expertise in civil, electrical, hydraulic, and mechanical engineering as well as expertise in Critical Path Method (CPM) scheduling, cost estimating, environmental compliance, and life safety issues. The ID/IQ contract will be for a period of one year from the date of contract award with four 1-year option periods. Only firms with Registered Professional Engineers licensed in Washington will be considered.  The cumulative amount of all Task Orders placed against the contract is not expected to exceed $3 million, but could be considerably less, and is dependent upon future availability of Reclamation resources and the amount of project planning and project management assistance required. The estimated date of contract award is January 2009. The selection criteria are: (1) Professional staff qualifications including education and registration status of key personnel in the specific engineering and project management disciplines stated above; (2) Specialized work experience and technical competence in the engineering, planning and project management of large multi-phase infrastructure projects including experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials, with preference given for experience and demonstrated technical competence in the planning and management of construction or renovation of hydropower or other power generation facilities; (3) Demonstrated corporate capability which reflects the capacity to accomplish the work in the required time, including adequate physical and technical resources considering numerous task orders may be executed simultaneously for work on multiple elements and sub-elements of the project; (4) Evidence of project management philosophy and established project management procedures which have resulted in successful past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry for large multi-phase, multi-discipline, infrastructure projects in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; and, (5) Location in the general geographical area of the project (the Pacific Northwest) and sufficient knowledge of the locality of the project to make informed recommendations to Reclamation during the planning and Project Management stages of the project with preference given to firms with key personnel who have a working knowledge of Grand Coulee Dam and its power plants. Firms qualified and interested in providing professional services of the types listed above are hereby invited to submit: Standard Form 330 (SF 330), "Architect-Engineer Qualifications," Part I and SF 330 Part II. An Adobe Acrobat version of the SF 330 form is available at www.gsa.gov.  When preparing your submission be sure to consider all evaluation criteria. Additional sheets may be used to address all evaluation criteria relative to the required services.  Following the initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, discussions will occur with firms considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the services for each of the three states.  Negotiations will begin with the most preferred firm(s) in the final selection.  If a mutually agreeable contract can be reached, then award will be made.  If not, then negotiations with that firm will be terminated and the next most preferred firm would be contacted for negotiation.  Please submit FIVE copies of the above information to: U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, 1150 N. Curtis Road, Boise ID 83706-1234, ATTN: PN-3715, Contracting Officer; include Solicitation No. 09SP101711 on the outside of the package.  Please do not submit any work samples at this time.

<DESC>I. BackgroundNASA is in the conceptual phase of identifying key performance indicators for thesuccessful design and production of the Altair (Lunar Lander) vehicle. Our goal is tomeet NASAs Lunar Exploration requirements safely and at the lowest life cycle cost. Asspecified during the Industry Day meeting conducted September 25, 2008, NASA will beawarding multiple fixed price contracts in early CY 2009. This interim developmentaldesign effort is intended to continue industry involvement and build on the knowledgedeveloped under the Altair study contracts by supplementing the NASA design teamemphasizing the areas of human space flight production, manufacturing, and operability.Contracts are planned to run into the 2012/2013 timeframe in support of the AltairSystems Requirements Review (SRR) and Systems Design Review (SDR).II. Objective This RFI is issued to request information from the aerospace industry regarding potentialimplementation mechanisms for the multiple contractor procurement strategy.III. Technical RequirementsThe Altair project has a technical requirement to supplement the existing NASA designteam to aid in maturing the current design with an emphasis on human space flightproduction, manufacturing, and operability requirements/capabilities. The intent is toutilize multiple contractor resources equitably to improve the single, government led,Altair design.IV. Acquisition Strategy Market research has begun for the Altair vehicle. Continued industry involvement early inthe NASA led design and development phase is highly desirable. Therefore, we are seekinginput from industry regarding the day to day implementation of a multiple contractorprocurement strategy, with the goal of improving a single design concept, and theinclusion of small businesses in this procurement. NASA intends to maintain the designerrole through SDR for the Altair project; however, in order to ensure a robust design,NASA is soliciting input on supplementing its current NASA team with industry partnerswho have proven experience in human space flight production, manufacturing, andoperability applicable to the Altair vehicle. The Altair planned acquisition approachwill utilize these guiding principles:1. Maximize competition to include the ability to re-compete at appropriate times.  2.Effectively enable a blend of NASA led design efforts with contractor involvement whilemaintaining a competitive environment until the most effective time to award full scaledevelopment and production contract(s).  3. Develop a set of metrics or measurementcriteria that would be used to evaluate the technical performance of the awardee(s) as itrelates to this interim developmental design effort.  4. Leverage existing industryprograms.  5. Maximize the use of all categories of small businesses, with particularemphasis in significant technical areas.  6. Mitigate conflict of interest risksincluding identifying barriers to competition for Altair that could be mitigated andsubsequently foster a more competitive environment.V. Summary While there is no formal page limit or format, a page guideline of 5 pages is recommendedfor the primary narrative text response. Inputs shall be compliant with all legal andregulatory requirements concerning limitations on export controlled items. Responses are requested to be submitted in Microsoft Office products in a user friendlyenvironment to facilitate review. One hard copy and 3 CDs or DVDs are requested.Responses are to be submitted no later than October 10, 2008, to Tim A. Boyes/BT/JohnsonSpace Center, TX 77058. Altair will be the vehicle to enable the United States to return to the moon and beyond.Merging NASAs and industrys core expertise will foster this endeavor. We solicit yourresponse and will continue to utilize this site to provide further updates to include thepossibility of an Altair Industry Day. Any questions can be directed to Tim A. Boyes at281-483-1838.

<RESPDATE>102108
<CONTACT>Maria L Mendoza, Purchasing Agent, Phone (206)526-6671, Email Maria.L.Mendoza@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Humboldt-Innovation GMBH. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed vendor will develop, test and implement 2D models of the characteristics of waves generated by landslides. The NOAA Center for Tsunami Research (NCTR) located at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) in Seattle, WA USA is working on a comprehensive tsunami hazard assessment of U.S. coastlines for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The assessment is based on tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation modeling. An important research topic necessary for this comprehensive endeavor is the understanding of the generation of tsunami waves caused by landslides. Two and three-dimensional modeling is crucial for characterizing the resultant tsunami wave in order to evaluate the potential threat for the near and far field. The major task will be to extend the currently two-dimensional models to three dimensions. The available 3D version of iSALE was designed to model meteorite impact processes. The approach is to adjust the 3D impact code to landslide modeling analogous to the 2D models. However, 3D modeling has high demands on computing power, and the available 3D code is not on the same development level as the 2D version and does not provide the same functionality yet. In particular multi-material handling needs to be implemented and computation efficiency has to be improved to enable the simulation of landslides and the generation of tsunamis with the 3D code. The aim is taking first steps towards 3D modeling of landslides with iSALE including: 1. Implementation of the multi-material handling, the crucially important first step. 2. Identification of required computation power for 3D models (such estimates depend to a large extent on an efficient implementation of multi-material handling) 3. Set-up of typical landslide geometries. To improve computation efficiency, special boundary conditions at the slope are required. 4. Implementation of landslide specific rheology models (analogous to 2D modeling) 5. Benchmarking and validation.The first steps will be performed at the Humboldt-University, Berlin, (2 months) where the model is currently used and no extra time for installation and adjustment to the available computer hardware is required. The work will then be continued at PMEL in collaboration with scientists of NCTR. The primary deliverable is implementation of improved 2D models of the characteristic of waves generated by landslides. An additional deliverable is a first generation basic approach towards 3D modeling of landslides. A report on the use of the model will be provided and personnel at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research will be trained in the use of the implemented model. Results of<br />this work should be published in international journals. Results will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) 2008 in San Francisco in December 2008. Other associated deliverables may also be provided, as governed by the evolving needs of the<br />project. The NOAA Center for Tsunami Research does not yet itself have the capability to conduct modeling of landslide generated tsunami. For this reason, the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research will collaborate with Dr. W&uuml;nnemann, who has developed the iSALE model. Originally developed by Dr. W&uuml;nnemann for modeling of meteorite impact, iSALE can be adapted for landslide modeling. Based on the 2D models that were developed during the first period of the project it is planned to implement further improvements to meet more realistic conditions for the generation of tsunami waves by landslides. The first study demonstrated that accurate description of material behavior is of crucial importance for the resulting wave signal. Some work will be spent on further improvements in material modeling. The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract with a period of performance that will start from date of award and will end January 31, 2009. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed attention to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513or email at maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov. This is a small purchase action estimated value not to exceed $100,000.00. ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003. After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505. All contractors are also required to complete online Representations and Certifications at HTTP://ORCA.BPN.GOV.</p>

_____DESCRIPTION:
I.	GENERAL
BACKGROUND
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  
(1) 	to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and 
(2) 	to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  
The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Sub-regional, or Resident Offices.
The Procurement and Facilities Branch, Contracts and Procurement Section, located in Washington, DC, is responsible for the planning, development, coordination, and execution of a comprehensive procurement program for the purchase of open market and other sources, and/or lease of diversified types of supplies and services.  The Contracts and Procurement Section also provides a centralized acquisition office for the NLRB for its Headquarters and 51 Field Offices.  
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE / HOURS OF OPERATION
-	Contractor personnel are expected to perform service during normal business hours. Normal business hours are 9:00 AM  5:30 PM.

&#61607;	Add or repair station jacks and station cords.  
&#61607;	If phone lines or sets are broken, install, move or repair phone equipment. Meet with dial tone vendor to determine if problem is a dial tone, a wiring or an equipment problem.
&#61607;	Moving of personnel to new offices: Perform phone closet cross connects so that the person moving will have the same phone number and voice mailbox.  
&#61607;	Install, repair or replace common equipment in the phone closet.
&#61607;	Install or repair wiring. This will include any re-wiring in the telephone closet.
&#61607;	Reprogram key system features.

The vendor will provide the NLRB with a maintenance log of all maintenance tasks, who performed the task and on what date.
All normal preventive maintenance will be scheduled during regular working hours.  
Hours of Work and Response Time The NLRB expects the contractor to respond to a trouble request no later than the next business day.

Period of Performance
The period of performance will be from October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009
Option 1 will be from October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2010.
_____EVALUATION. The Government intends to award multiple contracts to the responsible offerors whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government and represents the best value, price and other factors considered.  Offerors shall ensure they indicate which locations they are bidding on and provide separate pricing for each location.  Do not merely state $25 for each service call, when you are proposing pricing for several regional or residential offices.  Submit a separate cost proposal for each location.
The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Technical capability, past performance, and price/cost.  Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price/cost. 
The award will be made based on the best overall (i.e., best value) proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government and the proposed approach to performing telephone maintenance, with appropriate consideration given to the three evaluation factors:

	Factor 1.  Technical
	Factor 2.  Past Performance
	Factor 3.  Price

Relative importance of the factors, in that, the Technical factor is significantly more important than the Past Performance factor, which is slightly more important than the Price factor. The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than the Price factor. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than Acceptable must be achieved for all the factors.  Contractors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the contractor with lowest cost.

The Government reserves the right to evaluate quotes and award the delivery order on initial quotes, without conducting discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions with one or more contractors and request revised proposals.  

FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL. 

Technical approach will be evaluated based on the extent to which the contractor concisely and accurately discusses the nature of the services being requested

a.	Technical Excellence  The degree in which the contractor understands the technical requirements of the proposed contract.  

b. Personnel Qualifications  Contractor shall propose personnel requirements and qualifications, including key personnel and submit resumes for the key personnel.  In addition, the contractor shall provide letters of commitment or letters of intent for the key personnel. The resumes shall describe the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed key personnel.


FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE

Past performance shall be evaluated on a measure of the Governments confidence in the Contractors ability to successfully perform and meet the objective, based on relevant contracts the Contractor has undertaken within the last 3 years of similar size and scope.  The following sub-factors will be evaluated: 

a.Quality of Product or Service  The degree to which the Contractor can show the ability to meet all service level agreements and ensure customer satisfaction.

b.Timeliness of Performance  The degree in which the Contractor meets established schedules or milestones. The Contractor will describe how it will staff the requirements throughout the life of the contract.

c.Cost Control  The degree in which the Contractor completes repairs within the established time period.

d.Business Relations  The degree in which the Contractor has the ability to maintain a professional working relationship with government staff, be up front with controversial issues even if they are viewed negatively and maintain a high degree of honesty and integrity.

In the case of an contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Contractor will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
FACTOR 3:   PRICE Price will be evaluated based on competition and information supplied in each proposal.  In accordance with FAR 52.217-5, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the proposed line items or bottom line price is significantly unbalanced or unjustified.  The determination of Best Value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the non-pricing factors with the differences in the discounted prices proposed.  In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical performance than in lowest overall price.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve only a slightly superior technical performance.  Overall price may be more significant as proposals are determined to be equal based on other non price factors.

Acknowledgment of receipt of white papers will not be made, and white p apers will not be returned.  All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in the strictest confidence.  The initial screening will minimize unnecessary effort and expense in proposal preparation and review.  The SMDC DARPA Office will  ask only those offerors with promising white papers to submit full technical and cost proposals for formal evaluation.  The SMDC DARPA Office will notify offerors within six (6) months of white paper receipt if a full proposal is requested.  White papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data.   6.	Formal BAA proposals may be submitted without submission and review of a white paper. Offerors are encouraged to use the Summary White Paper process described above and may submit a formal proposal even if the government does not request it.  Issuance o f the BAA or any request for submission of a proposal does not obligate the Gov ernment to pay any proposal preparation costs. PART I -  WHITE PAPER PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION 1.	The summary white paper should, in summary, capture the proposed technical concept together with its rationale and objectives, methodology, the expected results, and its contribution to the USASMDC.

This announcement will become effective upon publication and will remain open for one year from date of publication.   PART III - EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it related to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exis ts.  Proposals will be evaluated monthly. The following factors are to be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA.   1.	General:  The Government selection of the proposal (s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the Government considering technical and management relative merit in accordance with the evaluation cri teria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance, using the areas and factors set forth below. 2.	Evaluation Areas/Factors 	a.	Technical Area.  The quality of the offeror's technical approach will be evaluated using the following factors: 		(1)	Overall Scientific/Technical Quality  The offeror will be evaluated on the overall scientific/technical merits of the proposed research and development.  The scientific/technical merits may include potential for state-of-the-art improvement, with sp ecial emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness. 		(2)	Qualifications  Capabilities and qualifications of the key research personnel relevant offeror experience and adequacy of facilities and instrumentation as required. 		(3)	Research and Development Contribution  Potential contribution of the proposed research to USASMDC in the above technology areas. 	b.	Management Area.  The quality of the offeror's proposed management approach will be evaluated using the following factors: 		(1) Overall Scheduling and Planning  The offeror's approach will be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort. 		(2) Expenditure Control  The approach for controlling expenditures and labor hours. 	c.	Cost Area 		The cost area is comprised of two evaluation factors; cost realism and total evaluated probable cost.  The cost realism and total evaluated probable cost to the government of the proposed work will be evaluated using the following: 		a.  Cost Realism:  The proposal will be evaluated to assess the likelihood that the technical and management approaches proposed could be accomplished at the cost proposed.  Cost realism will be evaluated but not rated. 		b.  Total Evaluated Probable Cost:  The proposal  will be evaluated to develop the governments estimate of the most probable cost to the government of successfully completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed. 	d.	Relative importance of Evaluation Criteria 		(1)  Technical:  The technical area is significantly more important than the management area.  The factors under the technical area are of equal importance. 		(2)  Management:  The management area is significantly less important than the technical area.  The factors under the management area are of equal importance. 		(3)	Cost:  (a)  The cost area is a substantial evaluation factor, however, it is less important than each of the technical and management areas.  (b)  Cost realism is a very important consideration in the evaluation of the technical and management areas.  Poor cost realism may result in a lower evaluation of the technical and management areas.  3.	Selection of proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the Government considering technical and management relative merit in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value consid erations, availability of funds, and program balance.  In some cases, the merits of a particular proposal in a technical discipline may lead to a decision with respect to funds availability relevant to USASMDC goals. PART V - OTHER INFORMATION 1.	The Government anticipates making multiple awards. Issuance of the BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs.  Offerors will be notified of selection for award approximately 45 days after government receipt of the propos als.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  Proposals not selected for immediate funding may be considered for a period of 6 months. 2.	Cost Plus Fixed Fee completion and/or level of effort contracts are expected to be awarded.  Contracts, grants, and other transaction awards will be considered.  For planning purposes, awards are anticipated from $100,000 to $5M for the basic contract w ith a period of performance not to exceed 12 months.  In addition to the basic contract, up to four (4) options can be proposed.  However, the total contract value for the basic and options cannot exceed $45M and the total period of performance for the bas ic and options cannot exceed 72 months.  This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of final report.   3.	Any necessary coordination of facility use will be performed by the offeror.   4.	The number and types of reports will be specified in the award document. However, the following are the titles, data item description (DID) numbers, and frequency of data items anticipated to be delivered during contract performance: 		(1)  STATUS REPORT,  			DI-MGMT-80368, Submission: Monthly/Quarterly	 		(2)  FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPORT 			DI-FNCL-80331, Submission: monthly 		(3)  SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL REPORTS SUMMARY 			DI-MISC-80048, Special Technical Report,  			Submission: As required by events 		(4)  OPERATIONAL SECURITY (OPSEC) PLAN, One-time  			(if required) 		(5)  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN 			DI-IPSC-81427A (if required) 		(6)  STATUS REPORT, FINAL REPORT 			DI-MGMT-80368, Submission: One Time 5.	Security Requirements:  While non-classified work is relevant, research at SMDC often leads to military applications and development or use of data that can be classified.  This is not always known ahead of time, and when it does the applicant must be p repared to deal with classified information.  Possession of a SECRET facility clearance is recommended.

The Government intends to purchase the following maintenance subscriptions for licenses as  a true-up to exisiting software requirements FAR Subpart 12.6 through a modification to the award in which DLT Solutions had previously responded:  

The purpose of this notice is to identify the net changes that occurred between the original Red Hat RHEL and JBoss quote of $173,820.62 and the updated version of the quote with a cost of $238,787.43 (attached) -- the total net change was an increase of $64,966.81, which is identified below:
 
-JBoss Application Platform Premium for up to 32 CPUs: quantity was increased from 1 to 2... per unit cost remained the same, this resulted in a net increase of $47,153.25.
-JBoss Application Platform Standard for up to 32 CPUs: this is a net new product on the new quote, resulting in a net increase of $31,435.71.
JBOSS Rules Framework Standard for up to 4 CPUs;  this mirrors line 8 from original quote, however, the product was changed from a quantity of 1 for 32 CPUs to a quantity of 2 for 4 CPUs, resulting in a net decrease of $22,005.01.
-JBoss jBPM Framework Standard for up to 4 CPUs: this mirrors line 9 from original quote, however the product was changed from a quantity of 1 for 32 CPUs to a quantity of 2 for 4 CPUs, resulting in a net decrease of $11,002.50.
JBoss ON Monitoring (4 CPUs) $2,619.65 and JBoss ON Monitoring for up to 32 CPUs $16,765.71: both are new items, resulting in a net increase of $19,385.36.
 
The changes identified above reconcile the total increase of $64,966.81 between the original and updated version of the quote.   

DLT Solutions was the only vendor that responded to the combined synopsis/solitation.  As a result, the true-up award will be made as an amendment to this solictation that was previously completed.  The total award of software maintenance will be $238,787 as a combined GSA Schedule/Open Market award.
