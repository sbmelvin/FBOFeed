<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)’s Office of New Reactors (NRO) serves the public interest by enabling the safe, secure, and environmentally responsible use of nuclear power in meeting the nation's future energy needs.  NRO’s Division of New Reactor Licensing (DNRL) supports the NRO mission to protect public health, safety, and the environment by leading and managing the activities associated with the licensing of new nuclear power plants.  These activities include planning and scheduling, infrastructure development, environmental and safety reviews and project management of new reactor activities in support of licensing, oversight, and rulemaking programs for new reactors.   DNRL is responsible as the project management organization for design certification (DC) application reviews, early site permit (ESP) application reviews, combined operating license (COL) application reviews, and new reactor pre-application activities.  DNRL develops and maintains the necessary regulatory infrastructure to support new reactor licensing activities, including rulemaking, guidance development, interaction with stakeholders on issues pertaining to new reactors, large-scale project management tools, schedule and resource planning and tracking, and issuance of design certifications, early site permits, and combined operating licenses. 

NRO anticipates the filing of more than 19 COL applications in the next several years and the number is growing.  As a result, substantial assistance will be needed by NRO staff to prepare for and review these applications.  NRO is currently developing the infrastructure needed to review this growing number of new reactor applications.  Technical assistance resources will need to be identified, coordinated, and managed to review these applications in a timely manner.  Given this increased workload in new reactor licensing and importance of meeting the schedule of new reactor licensing activities, NRC is seeking Contractor assistance in the preparation and review of these simultaneous applications.   The Contractor(s) shall provide qualified, competent, and fully trained personnel to perform the required technical support activities.

The Contractor(s) shall provide support in a wide range of technical and scientific disciplines in accomplishing work related activities aimed at ensuring the overall safety and adequacy of nuclear power plant design, construction, and operations.  Work related activities include design certification, early site permits, combined operating license and pre-application activity.    The scope of work involves placement of task orders in program areas such as DCs, ESPs, COLs and pre-application activity.  
 
The NRC has developed a strategy, referred to as the Design-Centreed Review Approach (DCRA) and referenced in the Regulatory Issue Summary 2006-06, “New Reactor Standardization Needed to Support the Design-Centreed Licensing Review Approach.”  DCRA is based on a concept of industry standardization of COL applications referencing a particular design (e.g., COL applications referencing either the Advanced Plant 1000 (AP1000), Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR), Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) or Evolutionary Power Reactor (EPR) reactor designs).  This approach uses, to the maximum extent practical, a “one issue, one review, one position” strategy in order to optimize the review effort, the resources needed to perform these reviews, and the review schedules.  One technical review will be conducted for each reactor design issue and use of this one decision will support the decision on a DC and on multiple COL applications.  In order for the DCRA to be fully effective, it is paramount that the Design Certification and COL applicants achieve a consistent level of standardization among related COLs.  The contract awards for this technical assistance will be allotted along new reactor designs consistent with the DCRA (e.g., AP1000, ESBWR, EPR, ABWR).  


It is anticipated that this requirement will result in up to four contract awards, one for each of four reactor design centers.  One of the four awards will be a small business set aside.  

It is anticipated that the contracts will be cost reimbursement type contracts.   

The period of performance of the resultant contract will be five (5) years. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about April 16, 2007 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The FedBizOpps website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments will also be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website. Hard copies of the solicitation document and its related documents, as appropriate, will not be available. Because this solicitation and its related documents, as appropriate, will be posted at this website, interested parties are instructed NOT to send letters or e-mails or faxes requesting the RFP. Telephoned, e-mailed, or faxed requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website to assure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. 

The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this business opportunity. 

The size standard for this solicitation is average annual receipts of $6.5 million over the past three years, as set forth under NAICS 541990.

Proposals for this requirement may be submitted by all concerns, i.e., large businesses, small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals  Notice to large businesses: The subcontracting plan requirements of P.L. 95-507 are applicable to this effort. Thus, all large businesses determined to be in the competitive range must be prepared to submit a detailed subcontracting plan. Notice to small businesses:  As noted in the preceding paragraphs, one of the four awards is set aside for a small business.

<DESC>The Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation numbered AG-0109-S-07-0005 on or about April 20, 2007, for the Tuxekan Island Roads project.

<SUBJECT>A -- Pre-Solicitation Notice for Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Long-Range Requirements Planning (ILRP) Studies
<SOLNBR>FA8219-07-R-BAAA
<CONTACT>Scott Wessell, Contracting Officer, Phone 801-775-4916, Fax 801-777-0990, Email scott.wessell@hill.af.mil
<DESC>1)  The Long Range Planning Division of the 826th Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Systems Group within the 526th ICBM Systems Wing, Hill AFB, Utah, intends to publish an annual open-ended Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for studies supporting the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Long-Range Requirements Planning (ILRP) team.  The ILRP team is chartered to identify emerging technologies for current and future weapon systems; guide technology investments to achieve future capabilities; and provide a forum for ICBM organizations to enhance communication.  These responsibilities are accomplished, in part, through the execution of the ILRP Study Process.  To assist with reaching these objectives, the ILRP is interested in receiving proposals for study of topics related to the ICBM weapon system and its subsystems.

2)  These subsystems include but are not limited to the following:

     A. Guidance systems and components including advanced autonomous platforms, inertial instrument technologies, and strategic radiation hardened parts;

     B. Propulsion systems to include advanced/improved motor technologies, boosters, post-boost components, and ordnance components;

     C. Reentry systems to include the operational and advanced reentry vehicles, materials, fuzing, and components;

     D. Ground systems to include launch facilities, launch control equipment, support buildings, operational ground equipment, and test equipment;

     E. Security and related systems/processes to include all types of security (e.g. physical security, computer security, etc); and

     F. Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4) to include managing processes and organizing, directing, transmitting, and receiving information related to the overall system.

3)  Each year the ILRP team is allocated funds to solicit studies addressing current or future warfighter needs and/or the availability of critical skills/infrastructure.  These studies must provide benefits toward an identified technology need.  ILRP studies have been conducted approximately every year since 1993. These studies analyze different solutions to address ICBM weapon system challenges or modification concepts, and also address new and emerging technologies for the weapon system.

4)  Separate calls for proposals requesting study topics may be issued yearly.  Each call will reference the basic BAA.  PROPOSALS SHALL BE SUBMITTED AGAINST APPLICABLE CALLS AND NO PROPOSAL SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AGAINST THE BASIC BAA.  The BAA and calls shall be published through FedBizOpps at http://fbo.gov.

5)  The Air Force anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract(s).  The Air Force reserves the right to make no award, a single award or more than one award.  NAICS for this acquisition is 541710; small business size standard is 1000 employees.

6)  Foreign firms are advised that they will not be allowed to participate in this acquisition at the prime contractor level.  The research data produced under a resultant contract may contain Military Critical Technology List (MCTL) information whose  export is restricted by the Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S. Sec 2751, et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401, et seq.).  Only those companies who are on the Qualified Contractors Access List (QCAL) may receive such information.  Request certification and registration from the Defense Logistics Service Center (DLSC), Federal Center, 74 North Washington, Battle Creek, MI 49016-3412 as soon as possible.

7)  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ogden Air Logistics Center Ombudsman, Ms. Julie Primbs, OO-ALC/PKC, at (801) 777-0768.

<DESC>ASC/CVH, 1450 Littrell Road, Room 7, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 intends to negotiate with The Properties at Wright Field, LLC, 4334 Glendale- Milford Road, Cincinnati, OH 45242-3706 on a sole source basis for the  privatization of an additional 496 units of military family housing at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, in a Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction.  The  transaction will not be funded directly with appropriated funds, but instead  will be funded from tenant rental payments, including allotments from  individual military service members’ monthly basic allowance for housing  payments.  Such transactions require the developer to renovate, construct,  maintain, repair, operate and manage for a period of approximately 50 years.   Estimated Transaction Closing: 1 October 2004 THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE FOLLOW-ON  TO A PRIOR COMPETITIVELY-AWARDED NON-FAR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION with The  Properties at Wright Field, LLC, to privatize an initial quantity of 1536  residential units at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. NO DATA/DRAWINGS  AVAILABLE. The approximate solicitation issue date will be December 2003.   Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2872 et seq.  Justification:  The agency has concluded  that the follow-on real estate privatization functions required are uniquely  available from only one source, because only the current privatization  developer is able to satisfy the agency’s needs to reduce the total number of  family housing units at Wright-Patterson AFB while maintaining units in on-base  locations, to assure that only military families reside in core security areas  of the base, and to assure that non-military families, if permitted to rent  under the tenant eligibility waterfall which is invoked in the event of low  military occupancy rates, can be diverted to remote/peripheral units where  security is less a concern. An attempt to compete this requirement would also  result in substantial duplication of costs not recoverable through  competition.  This synopsis is issued for information only and is not a request  for competitive proposals. Developers interested in providing an offer must be  able to demonstrate in writing, by two weeks from date this synopsis is  published, their capability to privatize the required units despite lack of  priority referrals and despite lack of a waterfall permitting filling vacancies  in core base areas with non-military tenants.  Information received will be  considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a  competitive procurement. A determination by the agency not to compete this  proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the  discretion of the agency. The agency will not pay for any information received.  A sole source, Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction RFP will be posted at   www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil on or about 1 February 2004.    It is suggested that  small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in  connection with the described real estate transaction contact the incumbent  developer listed. The point of contact for this real estate transaction and any  submissions, is the Original Point of Contact listed below.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) proposes to procure the services of Dr. Angelika Timme to assay saliva, sera, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from 50 Barbary macaques for salivary prolactin, salivary cortisol, CSF HV A, MHPG, and 5-HIAA, and serotonin transporter and MAOA gene polymorphism genomic status, as well as to assay observational behavioral data previously collected from the same monkey subjects in their free-ranging habitat near Dauo, Germany. These assays are part of a long-term collaborative research project with the LCE in which direct comparisons are being made on the above hormonal, genetic, and behavioral measures between the Daun Barbary macaques and the free-ranging rhesus monkeys at the LCE field station at the NIHAC, as well as with two other colonies of free-ranging rhesus monkeys. Previous observations have revealed major species differences between Barbary macaques and rhesus monkeys in overall levels of aggressive behavior, and the proposed comparisons will be made in order to determine if those species differences extend to more extensive and exhaustive measures of behavioral repertoires, as well as to hormonal and genetic measures postulated to underlie those behaviors.  Because Barbary macaques are an endangered nonhuman primate species, it is currently illegal to ship any biological samples obtained from them across national borders without an extensive series of permits.  Dr. Timme will be able to carry out all of the relevant assays within Germany, precluding any need for obtaining such permits prior to carrying out the proposed assays.  This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing, and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NICHD to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements.  Offers must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, and/or other information that demonstrates that the offer meets all of the foregoing requirements.  The determination to compete or not compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  It is anticipated that RFQ NIH-NIDDK-07-165 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of this synopsis.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  The anticipated award date is April 29, 2007.  Request for copies of the RFQ must be in writing to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Two Democracy Plaza, Room 774B, Bethesda, MD 20817 Attention: V. Lynn Griffin.  FAX quotations must contain offerors name, address, telephone number and fax number.  FAX quotations will be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.  FAX NUMBER 301-480-8501. All requests for quotation must include a valid email address.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ) OR AN INVITATION FOR BID (IFB), NOR IS IT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. IAW FAR Part 6.302-1( c ) – Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements / brand name justification: items peculiar to one manufacturer, NASA / Kennedy Space Center (KSC) intends to enter into a sole source procurement of the following items from Superior Access Solutions, Burnsville, MN 55337-1407. 1.  Part number SAS 10141 01 004, VAU DVB, 100bt, 2P, S/A Enc/Dec Qty – 8 each  2.  Part number SAS 10078-02-001-US, TW 401, High Speed Shelf, AC (Chassis & Supply) 19inch Rack mount, Qty - 4 Last item. The referenced Terawave equipment is determined to be the sole brand name capable to meet the Government requirements of interoperability, interchangeability, and compatibility with the Government-owned system currently operating at KSC.  Full and open competition is impractical for the following reasons: the chassis and modules must interface with existing KSC Broadband Cable Distributions System (BCDS) utilizing Terawave products.  The Launch Service Program (LSP) has historically been a bridge between KSC communication transmission systems and the Expendable Launch Vehicle complexes on the Eastern Test Range for NASA scientific spacecraft. In this capacity, LSP must meet KSC KICS specialized communication transmission equipment to maintain uninterruptible service to our NASA customers and transient spacecraft communities. Terawave equipment allows LSP to maintain compatibility with KSC infrastructure upgrade to digital BCDS with compatible equipment, while providing LSP customers seamless video service of their spacecraft. In addition, equipment spares and service contracts will be minimized reducing maintenance cost for KICS.	The referenced equipment is essential to the Government’s requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.	The specific manufacture and part numbers are required to integrate with current systems.  Failure to purchase these specific items may result in operational incompatibility that would impact performance of the system.  The acquisition of any other brand would therefore represent an unacceptable technical risk to KSC LSP missions.    The Government intends to acquire these commercial items using FAR Part 12, and 13 or a combination thereof.  Interested organizations may submit, in writing, their capabilities and qualification to perform the effort, to the identified point of contact, no later than 4:30 ET on 19 April 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications in response to this notice are not acceptable.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".

The Consumer Analytical Laboratory is currently in the process of testing numerous product samples which require completion.  The expense and logistical issues associated with moving the product samples in mid-evaluation to another contractor would be problematic due to hazardous goods requirements and chain of custody  issues.  Therefore, only the Ohio Department of Agriculture Consumer Analytical Laboratory can reasonably provide the needed services in a timely and cost effective manner without disturbing the scientific validity of the analyses.  The estimated value of this procurement is approximately  $52,917.00.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of Technology Transfer (OTT) is soliciting contractual support to provide patent-related services including patent searches, patent prosecution, infringement and interference services and licensing consultation.  Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act (FTTA), the NIH has a significant program in patenting and licensing inventions with commercial potential.  The OTT currently handles patent prosecution for the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  From time to time, it will also administer technologies for other Federal agencies.  It is expected that OTT will seek to file 200-300 patent applications each year.  Our active patent prosecution docket is in excess of 1,300 cases.  As would be expected in the world?s largest biomedical research institution, the inventions claimed in our patent portfolio fall generally into the following research categories:  biological response modifiers, cancer, HIV/AIDS, infectious disease, general medicine, bioinstrumentation, software, and research tools.  However, there are three categories of technology for which patent prosecution services will be required- biology, chemistry, and mechanical/electrical/software.  In addition, ancillary patent prosecution related services, related to Contested Proceedings and Licensing Consultation may encompass any of the research categories.
The period of performance of this contract shall be for one year (12 months), with options renewable for nine (9) additional 12 month periods. This is a competitive procurement using full and open competition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541110 with a size standard of $6.5 million. The Government anticipates a multiple award, IDIQ type contract. Solicitation 263-2006-P(GM)-0247 will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>MODIFICATION NO. 0001. The following synopsis hereby replace the previous synopsis.  
SERVICES SOURCES SOUGHT. THIS IS AN INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE NOTICE PURSUANT TO FAR 6.302-1.  THIS CONSTITUTES THE ONLY WRITTEN NOTICE. NO OTHER NOTICE OR SOLICITATION SHALL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE.  The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), Southeast Inspection Office, has a requirement to provide voluntary seafood inspection services in the State of Louisiana for the U.S. Department of Commerce Seafood Inspection Program. The Program is not subsidized by appropriated funding. It relies entirely on fee-for-service income to fund its operating costs.  Under authorities established by the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 USC 1621-1627), and the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, as amended (16 USC 742a-742k), NMFS is responsible for (1) the development and advancement of commercial grade standards for fishery products and better health and sanitation standards in the industry and (2) furnishing inspection and grading services and issuing certificates to producers, processors, shippers, receivers, or interested parties.  As defined by 50 CFR 260.6, the ?inspection services? performed under the Program include: sampling; determination of essential characteristics of or class, quality, and condition of any processed product; issuance of any certificate of sampling, inspection certificates, or certificates of loading a processed product, or any report relative thereto; or performance of any related services. An ?inspector? is any employee of the Department authorized by the Secretary of Commerce or any other person licensed by the Secretary. According to 50 CFR 260.49, inspections will ordinarily be performed by employees under the Secretary of Commerce who are employed as federal government employees for that purpose. However, any person employed under any joint federal-state inspection service arrangement may be licensed, if otherwise qualified, by the Secretary of Commerce. Additional information about the Program can be found at http://seafood.nmfs.noaa.gov.  Pursuant to the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, Title 3, Section 412, the State of Louisiana through the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry (LDAF) is exclusively responsible for the inspection, grading, and certification of fresh and saltwater fishery products in the State of Louisiana.  Accordingly, NMFS intends to solicit and negotiate a contract only with the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry (LDAF), P.O. Box 1951, Baton Rouge, LA, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by 48 CFR 6.302-1. The period of performance is for a base period from October 1, 2007 through February 28, 2008 with four (4) twelve (12)-month option periods. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interested parties should reference No. NFFKA520-7-00001PY and send their capability statement with evidence of licensing and ability to provide the required services stated above. All proposals received within 30 days after the date of publication of this synopsis may be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government to restrict competition for this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The applicable NAICS code is 541990.     Firms having questions regarding the requirement may contact Ted Mackey at Edward.H.Mackey@noaa.gov or (816) 426-2068 Patsy Ybarra at Patsy.A.Ybarra@noaa.gov. The firms may also send the capability information to these email addresses. All contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) in order to do business with the Government. Instructions for registering may be obtained at http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award, all bidders must have a Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) number.

The Grantee, the Moroccan Office National de l'Electricite (ONE)) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance on reorganizing ONE's corporate structure with the perspective of liberalizing Morocco's electricity sector.

The Government of Morocco (GOM) has been moving towards restructuring the country's electricity sector over the past few years.  The most concrete step towards liberalization is occurring now as the final language of the electricity sector reform act is being reviewed by the Ministry of Energy for submission to the Parliament.  ONE supports the liberalization and has been directly involved in developing the legislation, which is expected to be approved during 2006.  As the largest actor in Morocco's electricity sector, the electricity sector reform act's liberalization legislation ("liberalization legislation") will significantly impact ONE through major revisions to the company's mandate and the creation of an open and regulated electricity market.  

ONE is a publicly owned utility company and it is the principal actor in Morocco's electricity sector, with a monopoly on electricity transmission and the largest distribution grid in-country.  With regards to power production, ONE owns and operates power plants and since 1994 it has held long-term contracts with private producers.  ONE currently fulfills the mission of single purchaser in Morocco; all Moroccan power plants sell all of their production to the company, which in turn sells it to the distribution companies, and industrial end users.  ONE manages all high voltage transmission lines, and for customers not covered by distribution companies (which account for 50% of their sales) it manages all medium and low voltage transmission lines.  In response to the GOM's planned restructuring of the electricity sector and the upcoming liberalization legislation, ONE's operations will change and it must reorganize itself to best meet its revised mandate.  
 
The reform consists of liberalizing the electricity sector in order to create increased competition to supply high and medium voltage customers (for eligible customers excluding distributors) and drive electricity prices more competitive.  In addition, the reform would create a specific responsibility for ONE to deliver electricity to the remaining customers (including distributors) under a regulated market.  In essence, the liberalization will create an Open Market and a Regulated Market.  All customers on high and medium voltage will be progressively eligible customers for the Open Market.  An exception is for the distribution companies, which will remain in the Regulated Market.  The reform will cause the formation of a Regulator who will take on various functions of the Ministry of Energy and ONE, including setting regulated tariffs and rules for the Open Market.  Any licensed operator or power exporter/importer will be able to contract directly with eligible customers.  

ONE will remain the transmission company in Morocco outside of the distribution companies.  It will wheel power for Open Market suppliers and customers.  ONE will also remain the single purchaser for the Regulated Market.  All existing Moroccan power generation will be put to the Regulated Market.  The clear goal of the liberalization legislation is to create more competitively priced power for industrial and commercial customers so that they can become more competitive in their production costs.  An eligible customer may enter into a long term contract, or acquire electricity under short term supply conditions.  Eventually the Regulated Market medium voltage customers will gradually become eligible customers for the Open Market. 

In anticipation of the GOM's liberalization legislation, ONE has already implemented a partial reorganization with the advice of an U.S. consulting firm.  Among the changes it enacted, ONE created several divisions with individual profit and loss responsibility, allocating some functions into more suitable divisions.  But under the liberalization legislation, ONE will need to "corporatize" itself further and convert certain divisions into subsidiaries as defined in the proposed legislation.  ONE wishes to:  remain an efficient organization post-reform, ensure it can continue to remain competitive in both the regulated and liberalized market, and continue to fulfill its mandate to deliver electricity (its own or third party) at suitable costs to the end-user.  The liberalization legislation will require strict separation between the Open Market and Regulated Market businesses with which ONE will be directly involved, both as the main transmission company and as a power producer and importer.  In addition to obtaining advice on the establishment of the main subsidiaries, ONE wishes to evaluate the need to create a support subsidiary (or more) to provide services that can be shared by the main subsidiaries.  Finally, ONE seeks assistance in devising an implementation plan for the reorganization and support to initiate that plan.  To address these various needs, ONE has requested U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funding for Technical Assistance to help the company optimize its reorganization.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $820,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and French directly to the Grantee by 9:00AM, May 30, 2007 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

A.	Description--

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), is interested in identifying small businesses capable of providing engineering and technical, operational support services to effectively combine with Government personnel to perform its mission to manage, operate and maintain hydrometeorological systems and equipment.   A draft Statement of Performance is attached.

B.	Purpose of this Announcement--

NWS is primarily interested in identifying small businesses concerns [including small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, historically underutilized business zone (HUBZone) small businesses, and other small businesses] capable of providing the engineering and operational support services described in the attached Draft Statement of Performance as a prime contractor.  The Government envisions that the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for these services would be 541330, “Engineering Services,” and that the applicable small business size standard would be $4.5 million average annual receipts.

To demonstrate the ability to provide the required services, the small business concern must be capable of providing the following types of support:

1.  Identify staff personnel with the most appropriate management, administration, engineering, technical and financials skills necessary to accomplish tasks as defined by the Statement of Work.

2.  Proactively work with the NWS program or project office personnel using performance-based metrics to define projects corresponding with, and advancing program and administration goals.

3.  Proactively manage assigned personnel such that the tasks are accomplishing the performance metrics.

4.  Provide monthly earned-value reports of performance progress for each task.  The report should reflect the current definition of earned-value used by the Department of Commerce and be presented in a format that is easily understood by both program and procurement personnel.

Additionally, NWS is interested in identifying small business concerns capable of providing a portion of the required services as a subcontractor.
 
C.	Submitting a Response--

The Government will not be liable for any costs incurred in preparing or submitting a response to this Sources Sought Notice.

1.

D.	Evaluation of Responses--

The primary purpose of the evaluation process is to assist NOAA in determining whether the acquisition of these engineering and operational support services should be set aside for small business concerns (or some subset of small business concerns).  Additionally, NOAA will use the information received as an aid in determining small business concerns which should be identified in a solicitation for these services as a candidate team member.

In conducting its evaluation, NOAA may request a meeting or teleconference with one or more respondents to gain further insight into the respondent’s capabilities.  Also, NOAA may request further information from one or more respondents to gain further insight into the respondent’s capabilities.  The Government will not be liable for any costs incurred by respondents in these follow-up activities.

<DESC>Please note that this announcement is just the synopsis and not the solicitation.  The solicitation will be posted on this site by April 20, 2007.  Please watch for the posting and read the solicitation.  There will be time provided for asking questions after the solicitation is posted.  

The Department of State (DOS) has a current requirement for telecommunications cable system design, installation and testing services. We anticipate awarding four  IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) contracts .  Each contract will have a 12-month base year plus four 12-month Options. The contract ceiling is $2M per contract over 5 years.  Estimated  performance start date is June 2007.

The delivery orders will usually be for testing installed telecommunications cables systems at US Embassies and other diplomatic posts around the world but may require design and installation of systems at overseas posts on an infrequent basis.  The offer must be able to provide a Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) Archetect, A RCDD engineer and experienced Senior and Junior technicians.

This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541380 and the small business size standard is $11M.

In order to be considered for award of this contract, interested offerors, including all entities which comprise a joint venture, and the joint venture itself, must possess a Defense Security Service (DSS) Final Secret, Interim Top Secret or Final Top Secret facility clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. At least two contracts will be awarded to firms currently possessing Interim or Final Top Secret FCLs, while firms with Final Secret FCLs may be selected for one or more additional awards.  Offerors must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required qualification documentation.
Selected firms possessing a Final Secret FCL will be sponsored by Department of State for an FCL upgrade to the Top Secret level. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the upgraded clearance. A period of 90 days from the date of selection for award will be allowed for the Secret cleared firm to obtain an Interim Top Secret FCL.  After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider not awarding the contract to the selected offeror.
Due to time constraints, the Government will not delay award of contracts to selected firms already in possession of Interim and Final Top Secret FCLs.  Contractor personnel requiring access to classified information or Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must possess Secret or Top Secret personnel security clearances issued by DSS prior to performance on the contract.

<CONTACT>Pam McLay Realty Officer  ;
<DESC>CLARIFICATION: This notification is to clarify two elements of Solicitation STLI001-07 for ferry services at Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island. (1) MANHATTAN EMBARKATION SITE - Although the NPS is engaged in active negotiations for the possible use of  Pier A, for purposes of responding to questions set forth in the Prospectus, offerors should assume this hypothetical move will not occur. (2) NYCEDC HARBOR DISTRICT FERRY OPERATOR SOLICITATION - The NPS is aware that the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) published an advertisement in the New York Times on March 28, 2007, soliciting private ferry operators to enter into a memorandum of understanding with NYCEDC regarding NPS Solicitation STLI001-07 for ferry services at Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island. Offerors should be advised that the NPS is not a party to the NYCEDC solicitation and has not endorsed or approved its issuance; aspects of the NYCEDC solicitation, including terms of the proposed Harbor District Agreement, may not be in accordance with NPS policy, laws and regulations. Proposals submitted by Offerors in response to NPS Solicitation STLI001-07 will be judged solely, as required by law, on the determined merits of the proposal under the applicable selection factors and in comparison to the other proposals received, if any.

<DESC>The GOES are weather satellites built for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for use by the National Weather Service and other users.	The R series of GOES spacecraft will carry multiple earth-observing, solar observing and space observing instruments.  The GOES are based on a three-axis, body-stabilized design that enables the sensors to continuously view the U.S. and environs.  NOAA awarded contracts for the Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) phase of GOES R to three contractor teams in anticipation of a single contract for both the spacecraft and ground system.  However, as a result of PDRR and various external reviews, NOAA has determined that the spacecraft and ground system will be procured separately.  NOAA has delegated to NASA the responsibility for development of the GOES spacecraft.   NASA anticipates issuance of a Request for Proposals (RFP) in August/September 2007, for the acquisition of the Implementation phase of the R series of GOES spacecraft.   NASA anticipates award of a single CPAF contract. Key milestones for the acquisition are estimated as follows: Implementation contract award:	May 2008 Flight Model (FM) 1 delivery:	June 2014 FM 2 delivery:			October 2015 FM 3 and 4 are options A.  Presolicitation: This is a solicitation for information and planning purposes.  NASA anticipates that only those spacecraft vendors involved in the NOAA PDRR phase contracts will be viable competitors for the prime contract for the Implementation Phase of GOES R spacecraft.  However, in the interest of assessing whether other potential prime offerors exist, NASA has posted a draft specification on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service Web site at http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/procure.htm   .  The objective of this release is two-fold: 1)  to invite potential prime offerors, who were not involved in the PDRR phase contracts, to submit information that allows the Government to advise them about their potential to be viable competitors for the prime contract; promote competition; improve potential offerors’ understanding of the Government’s requirements; and improve the Government’s knowledge of industry’s capabilities; and 2) to invite small, small disadvantaged, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses to submit capabilities statements for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and small business subcontracting goals for this requirement.  Prospective offerors for the prime contract, who were not involved in the NOAA PDRR contracts are invited to submit comments on the specification or on other approaches to the Government’s requirements. This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. The preliminary documents described in this notice constitute all information concerning the procurement of the GOES R series of spacecraft that will be furnished at this time.  Firms interested in obtaining a hardcopy of this synopsis and specification must submit a request, in writing, to Clelia Walker, Code 210.7, NASA/GSFC, Greenbelt, Maryland 20771.  Offerors who are interested in proposing for the prime contract, who were not involved in the NOAA PDRR contracts, and intend to respond with a qualifications statement are requested to contact Clelia Walker within two days of receiving this notice.  Firms interested in proposing for the prime contract are requested to submit any comments and suggestions on the preliminary documents and their capability statements by April 13, 2007 to the address cited above.   We anticipate release of the final solicitation in August/September 2007.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. B. Government Assessment of Viability to Propose on Prime Contract 1.	NASA invites potential prime offerors, who were not involved in the NOAA PDRR contracts, to submit information that will allow it to advise them of their potential to be viable competitors for the prime contract.  This procedure is described in Part 15.202 of the FAR.  In order to be evaluated for your viability, you must submit the information described below.  NASA will utilize this information in order to advise you of your potential to be a viable competitor for the prime contract for the R series of GOES spacecraft.   2.	Information Requested – provide a capabilities and qualifications statement that includes: a.	A discussion of your past experience in developing spacecraft similar in nature to GOES, including a listing of contracts/subcontracts, and a brief description of the quality of your performance on these contracts. b.	A discussion of your understanding of the GOES R requirements, including: key technologies that can be applied to the GOES R; the impact of the resource envelope and the 5 year ground storage, 5 year on-orbit storage and 10 year on-orbit lifetime requirements in driving design considerations; lessons learned in past spacecraft development that can be applied to GOES R; any preliminary design and risk reduction activities that are relevant to GOES R. c.	A brief description of your facilities, financial condition and other resources necessary for formulating and implementing the GOES R spacecraft.  Include the availability of your facilities and other resources. This statement should be no more than 15 pages (8.5" x 11") in length. 3.	NASA will evaluate the submitted capability and qualification statements by considering the following criteria: a.	Depth and relevance of experience and past performance history, which convey a demonstrated ability to successfully perform the implementation phase of GOES R. b.	A demonstrated understanding of the GOES R requirements, including payload accommodation, impact of design life on spacecraft design, and risks associated with the development and fabrication of the GOES R spacecraft. c.	The adequacy and availability of necessary facilities, financial condition and other resources for implementing and performing the GOES R contract. After NASA’s evaluation of capability and qualification statements, NASA will advise each respondent, in writing, as to our assessment of viability to compete for the prime contract under this potential acquisition.  To be considered a viable competitor, you must be rated viable for all criteria.	NASA anticipates completing this evaluation within one week of receiving qualification statements.	NASA may ask for supplemental information to your qualification statement if there is uncertainty as to your viability.  You will be notified in writing regarding the results of this evaluation.  If you are found not to be a viable competitor, NASA will advise you as to the basis for that determination.	Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government, non-viable respondents can participate in any resultant acquisition.  C.  Small Business/Small Disadvantage Business/Women and/or Veteran Owned Business  Businesses under this category who wish to provide a capabilities statement should submit the same information as required for the potential prime offerors (see B.2 above).  This information will be used to assess the level of subcontracting goals for the prime contract.  Please note, however, that the Government does not intend to perform any viability assessment or notify the business entity as to their viability to participate in this requirement.

<DESC>15 CONS is seeking the interest of potential and eligible contractors in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design/Build Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) at Hickam AFB, Bellows AFB, and other installations in the Hawaiian Islands.   Responses are due no later than 15 calendar days after publication of this synopsis.   The MACC is a contract for execution of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction and may include design.  Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 ? Construction, Subsection 233 ? Building Development and General Contracting ? size standard $31 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities;  Subsector 234 ? Heavy Construction ? size standard $13 Million and Subsector 235 ? Special Trade Contractors ? Size standard $13 Million. Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades. Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  Individual task orders may range between estimated $2,000 - $2,000,000.  The program value is still under consideration, but at this point in time the program is Not-to-Exceed $50,000,000 over a five-year period.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.  The number of awards the government may award is still under consideration, however at this point in time the government may award as many as 8 contracts but anticipates awarding  approximately 5 contracts. The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference. The RFP may identify a seed project, which will be awarded to the highest rated offeror for the first award.  All other successful awardees are guaranteed a minimum of $2,500.  The government will compete future individual requirements among the awardees.  This acquisition is being considered for Section 8(a) set-aside, partial HUBZone set-aside, unrestricted competition, or a combination of these. In responding to this sources sought synopsis, please indicate your interest as a prime contractor, teaming partner, joint venture, primary subcontractor and indicate if your business is 8(a) and/or HUBZone certified, large, or small and provide evidence of recent (within three (3) years), relevant (multiple trade, multiple task order) experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers and a statement as to why the project is relevant, and; (d) availability of bonding of at least $10,000,000 (maximum anticipated for each performance period) for this project. An actual solicitation is expected to be issued in early 2007.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Web Site at http://www.eps.gov at that time.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package. Potential offerors MUST register at www.eps.gov./ in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation. All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov. Prospective offerors who would like their company name included on the Bidders Mailing List (planholder's list) may do so on the fedbizopps website under IVL (Interested Vendor?s List). This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or multiple contracts nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Virginia Diodes, Inc. (VDI) 979 2nd St. SE #309, Charlottesville, VA 22902-6172 for a high-power submillimeter-wave oscillator to serve as an illuminator for a submillimeter-wave camera that is currently being assembled for phenomenology and imaging research in the required spectral region.  
Required specifications are:  Frequency: fixed frequency within the range 300-360 GHz. Exact frequency should be selected to maximize power; Output Power: greater than 10mW; Beam quality: shall be single-mode, waveguide-coupled with a standard horn antenna; Construction: shall be all solid-state in order to maximize reliability and lifetime. No vacuum electronic components (e.g. klystrons or other tubes) are acceptable.  A complete turnkey system is required.
Above approximately 150 GHz, the only solid-state technology that can provide mW-level powers is multiplication of lower-frequency oscillators.
Based on market research, VDI's multipliers provide significantly higher power than their competitors' devices.  Specifically in the 330-360 GHz band, no competitors offer any device providing greater than 2mW.  Moreover, VDI is the only manufacturer offering complete systems, including the lower frequency oscillator, isolators, etc, as required by NIST. 
Delivery is required by July 31, 2007.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K). This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement.  Respondents must provide sufficient documentation that address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing (e-mail preferred) no later than close of business April 20, 2007. Anticipated award date is April 23, 2007.

<DESC>The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), Influenza Division (ID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) supports a World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza, to present to the FDA and the vaccine manufacturers twice yearly the seed viruses that are to be used in the production of influenza vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere and the Sothern Hemisphere.  The FDA requires that the viruses be grown exclusively in eggs, because tissue culture may contain latent viruses that might be detrimental to the vaccinees. The Influenza Division also has the responsibility of producing 500 WHO Influenza Reagent Kits for the identification of influenza isolates.  Each year the Influenza Division will also produce supplemental non human influenza reagent kits.  Lastly, eggs are also used throughout the year for research purposes.   The three activities noted above result in the usage of between 14,000 and 17,000 dozen eggs per year.

The CDC is searching for Contractors who can furnish 14,000 to 17,000 dozen white embryonated 10 day old chicken eggs per year that will be used singularly and in conjunction with various tissue culture systems for the isolation of influenza viruses.  The contractor shall  guarantee that a minimum of 95 percent of the white fertile chicken eggs be viable at delivery.  If possible, all white fertile chicken eggs furnished shall be from a single flock, and all flocks from which eggs are furnished shall meet the requirements of the National Poultry Improvement Plan of 1963, after testing by an official of the appropriate State Agency and shall qualify for the rating, "U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean".  Eggs shall be free of bacterial, fungal or mycoplasmal contamination.  Eggs shall weigh a minimum of 23-25 ounces per dozen and shall not be washed, dipped, fumigated, buffed, or cleaned in any manner but shall be smooth, free from blemishes, cracks, fecal material and pencil or other markings.

<DESC>NIST EARTHQUAKE STRUCTURAL AND ENGINEERING REASEARCH RELATED TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES

This is a request for information/sources sought notice (RFI) to assist the Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in completing market research to establish and prioritize research needs and technology transfer activities in support of key National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) program activities to improve the understanding of earthquakes and their effects on communities and regions, buildings, structures, and lifelines.  Potential sources will 1) perform various studies and consultations that will assist NIST in formulating and conducting problem-focused structural engineering research; 2) establish and prioritize measures, research needs, and technology transfer activities in support of key NEHRP program activities; and, 3) perform program integration and project management services and convene or conduct workshops and expert task groups in specific areas of NEHRP research for a procurement that is planned for fiscal year 2007 with a sixty(60) month period of performance.  No solicitation is currently available, and no unsolicited proposals will be entertained as a result of this RFI. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) has a long history of serving the measurements and standards needs of the building and fire safety industries.  In this service, NIST BFRL performs problem-focused structural engineering research related to buildings and other structures.  Key areas of structural engineering research include risk assessment and mitigation (including performance prediction and evaluation) for earthquakes, extreme winds, fires, floods, explosions, and impacts.  This problem-focused research concentrates on efforts that support the development of national model building codes, standards, guidelines, enabling tools, and industry practices.  Some of this research advances the results of basic research that has been completed under the auspices of the National Science Foundation toward field application.  Complementing its role in performing problem-focused research related to earthquake risk evaluation and mitigation, NIST is the lead agency for the NEHRP, the Federal Government?s program to reduce earthquake-based risks to life and property.  In addition to NIST, the NEHRP program agencies include the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).

As NIST may support NEHRP in the duties noted above, NIST seeks information from industry sources with CURRENT, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE IN THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM INTEGRATION AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT AREAS so that NIST can determine an appropriate acquisition strategy to satisfy its requirement.  NIST is especially interested in receiving input from small businesses who can provide the below described capabilities :

Any potential source will be tasked to use its structural engineering, earthquake science, and earthquake engineering experience and expertise to perform studies and consultations, convene expert task groups,  provide the subject matter expertise necessary to plan, organize and conduct workshops in the following areas: 1) establish and prioritize research needs and technology transfer activities in support of key NEHRP program activities to improve the understanding of earthquakes and their effects on communities and regions, buildings, structures, and lifelines.  These studies may include interdisciplinary research that involves engineering, physical sciences, social sciences, economics, and decision sciences; 2) establish and prioritize research needs and technology transfer activities in support of developing structural integrity; progressive collapse mitigation; seismic design; wind engineering; blast and impact resistance; lifeline engineering, flood, snow and ice, and other provisions in National model building codes, standards, and guidelines.  These activities may include multi-hazard failure analysis; 3) establish and prioritize measures that are needed to promote the adoption of earthquake and other hazards reduction and safety measures by Federal, State, and local governments; National standards and model code organizations; architects and engineers; building owners; and others with roles in planning and constructing buildings, other structures, and lifelines.  These measures may include, but would not be limited to, earthquake scenario activities and information repository formation; 4) establish and prioritize measures that are needed to develop and implement performance-based structural design standards, guidelines, practices, and structural performance prediction and evaluation tools for earthquakes and other extreme loads; 5) establish and prioritize measures that are needed to improve structural design and construction productivity for mitigating the effects of earthquakes and other extreme loads.  These measures may include NIST interaction with organizations such as the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI) to facilitate improved building information modeling and electronic data exchange in the structural and architectural engineering arenas, encompassing life-cycle planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of buildings and lifelines; 6) perform technical peer review of NIST and NEHRP research program activities; and, 7) support the Federal Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC).  Any potential source shall exhibit capabilities in strategic planning, performance management and measurement, information support (including program analysis, technical writing, and product development and dissemination), and the development of public outreach materials, both printed and web-based.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.    The major facilities in the area includes:  MacDill AFB, FL, Eglin AFB, FL, Keesler AFB, MS, Fort Benning, GA, Fort Gordon, GA, Fort Stewart, GA, Fort Jackson, SC, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL, Naval Hospital Beaufort, SC, and Naval Hospital Pensacola,  FL.

In order to participate your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreemen t (DAPA) with the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) AND A separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendo rs to distribute their items.  This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is NOT a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime Vendor program please access the web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.     The agreement with incentive pricing will be based on a committed volume for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from the date of award with three (3) - 12 month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  A single selection is intended in this project ; however, the Southeast Region acknowledges the possibility of multiple selections for this agreement.  Consideration will be based on best value to Government, based on evaluation of factors listed here.  Anticipated award date is September 2007.  The ev aluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The award will be determined utilizing Best Value/trade off criteria.        Point of Contact is Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   B.	Products & Performance Required    The Southeast Region is seeking product lines in the category of Ostomy Supplies.  The yearly estimated total volume for Ostomy Supplies is $132,737.81.

Vendors will be required to the provide responses to the technical/company criteria.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline for the solicitation response will be eliminated from the standardization process.

Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert like one to five rating scale.  One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance questions weighted equally.  The CPT has set a  3.0 acceptability threshold for all product groups.  Clinical/performance results lower than a 3.0 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Phase III.  After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.0 threshold will be invited to participate in Phase III, pricing evaluations.  All vendors will be asked to  submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Southeast Region.      Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  Pricing will be evaluated based on the best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exc eed 5 years).

<SUBJECT>D -- MARKET RESEARCH INQUIRY - ICE2
<DESC>PURPOSE:  The purpose of this posting is to announce the need to revise the contract ceiling on the Intelligence Information, Command & Control, Equipment & Enhancements (ICE2), Contract Number F09603-03-D-0095, and to determine if there are any contractors who possess the capability to assume this workload within the next twelve (12) to eighteen (18) months. 

DESCRIPTION:  The scope of the ICE2 effort is to provide worldwide sustainment, maintenance and technical support effort for Intelligence and Command and Control systems.  The equipment supported by this contract consists of commercial, modified-commercial, and specially designed equipment items.  Departments and agencies supported by this multi-service contract include, but are not limited to, the Departments of the Air Force, Army, Navy, State, Energy, Treasury, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Unified Commands, Coast Guard, Air National Guard, Special Operations Forces, Joint Reserve Intelligence Program, National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office.  

The ICE2 contract was awarded on 11 June 2003 as an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to a single source, General Dynamics, Needham, MA, based upon full and open competition.  This contract contains a basic four-year ordering period with two, three-year incentive options making the potential length of the contract a maximum of ten years.  

ACTION REQUIRED:  Contractual action is required to increase the contract ceiling.  It is necessary to increase the ceiling due to unanticipated high level of support due to the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) as a result of the events of September 11, 2001 and the resulting mission requirement changes in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.  All work to be performed under the contract is considered to be in accordance with the original statement of requirements; however, GWOT increased the amount of work to be accomplished to an amount not contemplated in the original ceiling price.  As a result of the requirements placed against the contract supporting GWOT, the original established contract ceiling of $1.95B is expected to be reached in contract year five.  An increase in the ceiling will provide for continued critical support of various projects for all the services that are affected by this contract to include, but not limited to, the Departments of the Air Force, Army, Navy, State, Energy, Treasury, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Unified Commands, Coast Guard, Air National Guard, Special Operations Forces, Joint Reserve Intelligence Program, National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office.  The increase will ensure sufficient contract ceiling is available for new tasks supporting the mission of the United States Government as a result of September 11.  

RESPONSE REQUIRED:  As stated above, one purpose of this posting is to determine if there are any contractors who possess the capability to assume this workload within the next twelve (12) to eighteen (18) months.  This would include the requirement for personnel (currently in excess of 2300 worldwide, performing in residential, deployed and per-call scenarios) who currently hold Top Secret / Secure Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) Clearances.  Responses should be submitted to Cathy Schoonover, 560 ACSG / GFKAB, 478-926-8374, cathy.schoonover@robins.af.mil, no later than     14 April 2007 

FUTURE ACTION:  A competitive follow-on acquisition, similar in scope to this current requirement, is planned to replace this contract.  Acquisition planning has begun for the follow-on; award is contemplated in FY09.  It is anticipated that a synopsis regarding the follow-on will be posted on or about 01 Nov 07.

<SUBJECT>A -- Rapid Attack Identification, Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Block 20 (RB-20) Program
<DESC>This synopsis is issued for the sole purpose of the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) to inform industry of a Phase A acquisition strategy change relating to the Rapid Attack Identification, Detection, and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Block 20 program (RB-20). The RB-20 program was presented to industry during the Industry Day conducted on 28 Nov 2006 that published under FedBizOpps Reference Number 07-08.

The RAIDRS Block 20 (RB-20) team has been conducting market research and evaluating acquisition strategy options for the RB-20 Phase A requirements definition effort for which a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) was previously released under FedBizOpps Reference Number 07-21.  

The SYSW RB-20 program office team has made a decision to not release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for this effort.  Instead, the RB-20 team will pursue an alternative Phase A acquisition strategy.  This strategy will combine the requirements development process with rapid prototyping in order to deliver capability quickly while simultaneously maturing the RB-20 technical requirements.  As a result of the acquisition strategy change, the Government will not issue a competitive studies contract for this effort. 

The RB-20 team will structure the remainder of RB-20 Phase A effort to be as open as possible, with multiple Industry Days and open requirements working groups.  Industry will be invited and encouraged to participate throughout the technical requirements development process.  

The RB-20 team recognizes and appreciates the number of potential bidders and the industry and government funded work that has led to some very promising technologies that may be made a part of the eventual RB-20 system solution.  We fully appreciate the industry participation to date in our market research.  Further information on how industry can be involved with particular solutions will be forthcoming as the program office finalizes the Phase B acquisition strategy.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a sole source basis is for the use of a maintenance contract.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/ITI/SI/DTS is working in conjunction with Ericsson Federal Inc. to maintain preexisting systems in order for it to work properly.  Ericsson Federal has worked closely with IRM/OPS/ITI/SI/DTS to build a contract to their specific requirements and a maintenance contract with another brand will cause a disruption in daily operations and put the integrity of the current secure systems at risk. As this is a sole source justification, Ericsson Federal Inc. unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  The services identified by Ericsson herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Domestic Technical Services infrastructure.  The previous maintenance contract was originally maintained by Marconi Communications.  Marconi was recently acquired by Ericsson Federal Inc.<BR><BR>

	                           					  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is set aside for small business.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the items shown below.  Please see the Solicitation Instructions that follow the specification portion of this solicitation.   GENERAL SPECIFICATION NASA, Glenn Research Center is charged with developing the Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system for the Upper-Stage of the new ARES I launch vehicle.  As part of this program we will be building a hydraulic breadboard system to evaluate the TVC hydraulic system components.  An integrated motor driven hydraulic pump will be needed for this breadboard testing, which will require a vendor to incorporate an existing, government-owned aircraft pump into its motor/pump design and assembly. The overall goal of the breadboard testing is to evaluate the functionality of each hydraulic system component (both steady state and dynamic), determine if each hydraulic component is adequately sized, and to see how all the hydraulic components operate when integrated into a complete TVC system. The primary motor/pump assembly will supply the required flow of hydraulic oil to the downstream hydraulic system components. The motor/pump assembly operation will be controlled from an operator control room that is remotely located from motor/pump assembly.  The tests that will be run using this motor/pump assembly will be relatively short duration tests. A majority of the tests should typically last no more that about 30 minutes – 1 hour. The hydraulic flow demand during these tests will be fluctuating continuously between the minimum flow and maximum flow (25 GPM) of the pump. The breadboard check-out testing is planned to start in July/August 2007 timeframe and continue for about 4 - 5 months. The motor/pump assembly will be run approximately 10 – 20 hours/week during this 4 - 5 month time period.  The specifications/requirements are attached, as are a Vickers Pump Summary Document and the related drawing. DELIVERY SCHEDULE AND FOB POINT Delivery to NASA Glenn Research Center is required within 3 months from date of award.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination, NASA Glenn Research Center.	 SOLICITATION INSTRUCTIONS Note for those proposing advance payments:  FAR limits advance payments for commercial items to not greater than 15% of the total price for the item.	If you require payment in advance, do NOT exceed this limitation. Note for those proposing shipping costs: any costs for shipping shall be included in the quoted price of each item.  DO NOT quote shipping separately. Note to those proposing their terms and conditions: provide a copy of such for evaluation by the Government.  The Government is NOT subject to state sales tax or laws of a specific state.  Therefore, either line out such language or clearly state what terms are not subject to the Government for the instant procurement.   Note to those offering imported items or items subject to duties, freight and insurance:  The proposed price SHALL include all duties and shipping and costs.    The Government is self insured and does not pay extraordinary insurance other than that already included in normal shipping practices. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-13. The NAIC code is 333911 and the small business size standard for this procurement is 500 employees.

A contract for an alarm system for the new OSI building will be awarded to Advantor Systems Corporation following no response back to this notice of intent.  The purchase of an alarm system for the new OSI building must be done through Advantor Systems Corporation because they are the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. All MacDill AFB alarm systems are monitored by the 6th SFS and are consolidated into a single Advantor monitoring panel for efficiency of space, maintence, and overall operations. That said, all alarm systems to be monitored by 6th SFS must be Advantor systems to ensure compatibility with existing equipment and processes. In addition to having the alarm system equipment and alarm system relocated and installed, SCIF and armory accreditation require 24-7 monitoring of the alarm system, with an associated ability to respond to alarm activations within 10 min. 

Market research was conducted for the purchase of this alarm system and Advantor Systems Corporation is the only contractor found able to supply this item as we require. If no response to this notice is received by 3:00pm EST on Monday, April 09, 2007, the award for this alarm system for the new OSI building will be made to Advantor Systems Corporation.
