STATEMENT OF WORK
Inspection, Safety Device Testing and Calibration
Boiler Plant Burners, Controls, Instruments, and Data Management


1.	Introduction:

A.	Many VA Health Care System (VAHCS) have a central boiler plant to provide steam for heating and air conditioning, domestic hot water, kitchens and sterilization. Some medical centers have laundries that utilize steam.

B.	Boiler plant safety, reliability, efficiency and equipment longevity are paramount concerns of VAHCS management. Malfunctioning burners or controls can cause catastrophic events resulting in injuries and death and massive property damage. Inaccurate or inadequate data management and monitoring systems can fail to warn of unsafe or inefficient performance. Regular inspections, testing and calibration by expert technicians are an essential part of a program to address these concerns.

C.	This "Statement of Work" describes the requirements for the inspection, testing and calibration of the boiler plant burners, controls, and instruments by qualified technicians.

D.	Work to be completed at the: SAINT LOUIS VA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM - BOILER PLANT (BLDG 8)

E.	A separate "Statement of Work" document covers the inspections of the boilers and boiler plant equipment by Qualified Professional Inspectors.

2.	Technician Qualifications:

A.	Technicians shall have completed at least a one-year trade school and have five years successful experience in this field. The experience shall be largely with institutional and industrial boiler plants similar in design to the VAHCS plant. The VAHCS facility manager/engineer may define and accept equivalent qualifications. Project manager shall be OSHA 30 certified. All other employees shall be OSHA 10 certified.

B.	Technicians shall demonstrate familiarity with and have ready access to the current versions of the following references:

NFPA 85, Boiler and Combustion Systems Hazards Code. 
VHA Boiler Plant Safety Device Testing Manual, 3rd Edition.
C.	Technicians shall be equipped with portable electronic flue gas analyzers and other test instruments necessary for the required tests and calibrations, all calibrated within one month of the site visits. Technicians shall be familiar with programmable digital controls and have the capability to program, to include hardware and software requirements.

3.	Inspection, Testing and Calibration Requirements:

A.	Technicians shall provide all tools and labor necessary to perform inspection, tuning, testing, calibrating, and adjustments of burners, and boiler plant controls as specified below. This shall be done every six months in accordance with a schedule provided by the VAHCS. VAHCS may extend the schedule for burners in limited service.
 
B.	Instrumentation, monitoring, and data management systems as listed in sections 3.F -
3. J of this SOW shall be calibrated every six months.

C.	Provide at least two weeks notice to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) prior to performing the work. Work cannot be scheduled during heavy steam load periods. Only one boiler at a time can be out of service for the inspection, testing, and calibration procedures. Work must be conducted when the COR or designee is available on site to monitor the work.

The CORs are: 
JOHN COCHRAN 		Dave Merritt	 314-286-6437
JEFFERSON BARRACKS	Dan Eibeck 	 315-652-5730

D.	VAHCS will have the boilers that are to be serviced prepared for the technicians upon their scheduled arrival. This includes having the boilers clean of soot and loose scale; fully warmed and at normal steam pressure; steam exhaust silencer system operable; all boiler, burner, and fuel train pressure gages and thermometers calibrated; fuel meters in accurate operation (pressure/temperature correction factors provided, if applicable); boiler steam flow, stack temperature, and flue gas oxygen instruments operating.

E.	VAHCS will comply with other requirements of the service technician that are considered reasonable by VAHCS and have been presented in writing at least two weeks prior to the scheduled testing.

F.	The inspections, testing, and calibrations shall comply with:

1)	The recommendations and requirements of VHA Boiler Plant Safety Devices Testing Manual, 3rd. Edition.

2)	The written recommendations of the equipment manufacturers.

3)	The requirements and recommendations of NFPA 85 Boiler and Combustion Systems Hazards Code including applicable appendices.

4)	Burner performance requirements in this document.

G.	A summary of the work is as follows:

1)	Review boiler plant log sheets, alarm reports, and trouble reports.

2)	Review records that show combustion performance (flue gas oxygen and carbon monoxide).

3)	Perform overall visual inspection of systems. Verify that systems comply with referenced codes and VAHCS requirements stated in this contract.

4)	Test and record the operation and set points of all burner/boiler safety interlock devices. Refer to list below.  Verify that the set points and operating points are within approximately 20% of normal operating parameters. Make adjustments as necessary and record the new settings. The operation of a device must result in burner shutdown and/or proper alarm operation.

5)	Operate burner(s) on each fuel from low fire to high fire and back to low fire in at least six increments and record combustion performance (flue gas oxygen, carbon monoxide, NOx where applicable), fuel train pressures, atomizing train pressures, burner pressures, stack temperatures, boiler steam output.
 
6)	Compare the combustion performance data with VAHCS requirements (see below) and previous readings. If necessary, make adjustments to the fuel flow and combustion air controllers, control valves, and dampers to obtain the required performance. Record the new performance data.

7)	Verify accuracy of instrumentation listed below. Verify that all devices are properly selected for the application in terms of type, size, set point range, performance, code approval. Calibrate all instruments that are not within manufacturer's specifications for accuracy.

1)	Steam flow transmitters (all).

2)	Steam flow recorders/computer readout.

3)	Flue gas oxygen sampling, analyzing and recorder/computer readout.

4)	Boiler and economizer stack temperature transmitters and recorder/computer readout.

5)	Master steam pressure and combustion controllers.

6)	Boiler outlet draft controllers.
 
7)	Boiler water level controllers.

8)	Feedwater deaerator and condensate storage tank water level controllers including overflow.

9)	All pressure and temperature sensors and transmitters.

10)	All signal processing and readout devices.

4.	Report Requirements:

A.	Provide complete written report of the inspection fully describing all tests performed, all findings, and all recommendations. The report shall have two sections, the first section will be in a table format with four columns:
a.	The first column labeled "FUNCTION" did the device pass or fail.
b.	The second column labeled "DEVICE" list the device number and description in accordance with the VHA Boiler Plant Safety Devices Testing Manual, 3rd Edition.
c.	The third column labeled "DEFICIENCIES-RECOMMENDATIONS"
d.	The fourth column labeled "CORRECTIVE ACTIONS" list any corrective actions taken during the inspection.
The second section shall be in a paragraph/bulleted format and list each device individual in accordance to the VHA Boiler Plant Safety Devices Testing Manual, 3rd Edition. Plus the section must reference the correct Master Specification and Standard Detail for that
device. See sample below.

5.1. Condensate Storage Tank High Water Alarm
Purpose: High water level may be an indication of condensate transfer pump failure that could lead to low water condition in the feedwater deaerator and in the boilers. There may be a failure of make-up water controls.

Recommended set point: 4 inches below overflow level and 2/3 of tank height.
 
Potential hazards due to failure of high water alarm: Feedwater deaerator running dry and, consequently, boiler feed pumps running dry will cause overheating and damage to pumps and potential for plant shut down. Failure of make-up water controls (in open position) could lead to significant cost from waste of water and condensate from the tank overflow if this occurs over a long time period.

Recommended type of device: Conductivity probe type switch. Float type switches have high failure rate in this application where they are exposed to flash steam that causes seals to harden and prevent float movement.

VA Master Specification section: 23 50 11 (old 15625). www.va.gov/facmgt/standard/

VA Standard Detail: SD232111-05.pdf www.va.gov/facmgt/standard/

Failure rate of float types: 48% (BEI study of VA boiler plants).

Make and Model: Mercoid Float

Did it function properly: No

Category & Action Time Limit: Upon Failure or Within 5 Years

Comments: Float type switches are not allowed for high water alarms. The VA recommended switch type is a conductivity probe type switch. Install the VA recommended switch and set to alarm at 2/3 of the tank height. There are valves that can isolate this alarm. These valves must be made lockable only in the operating position.

B.	Furnish report within one week of each inspection in "Microsoft Word" format by email to the COR. Provide hard copies of data sheets and flue gas analyzer "strip" printouts to the COR within one week of visit.
 
C.	All safety-related deficiencies shall be immediately reported to the COR, Boiler Plant Supervisor and/or Chief Engineer during the inspection visit.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.
