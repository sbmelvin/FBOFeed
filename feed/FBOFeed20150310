<DESC>This is a synopsis of proposed contract action FA4452-15-R-0009. This is not a solicitation or invitation for offerors to submit proposals.
<p>Headquarters Air Mobility Command Directorate of Operations Training Division (HQ AMC/A3T) requires contractor support to provide academic and simulator training supporting USAF Active Duty C-40 (B-737-700/800) flight crews. Required training includes academic and simulator training for the following courses: Initial Qualification Pilot Training, Re-Qualification Pilot Training, USAF-Specific One-Day Training, Pilot Recurring Evaluation Training, Refresher Pilot Training, and Pilot Senior Officer Training. Training shall be conducted at the contractor's facility in a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved training center by FAA approved instructors. To be considered qualified, each contractor must possess an applicable training program approved under Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) Part 121, or a training course approved under 14 CFR Part 142. USAF cockpit procedures and checklists shall be used in all courses. Also included are additional hourly simulator time, simulator position fill-ins for when the government is unable to fill a simulator cockpit, and simulator time and use of facilities for an Air Force-conducted training day session. At a minimum, the contractor shall furnish a FAA certified C-40 (B-737-700/800) Level C or better Flight Simulator or Level 5 or better Flight Training Device for systems training, and Level D, CAT IIIa capable, flight simulator for initial, refresher, recurring evaluation and senior officer pilot training. Simulators shall be configured with General Electric CFM-56-7B27 engines and dual cue flight directors with the Rockwell Collins model 4000 Head-Up Guidance System (HGS). Contractor shall update associated simulator software within 30-days of release to the USAF aircraft fleet. <br /><br />The government plans to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for the C-40 (B-737-700/800) Pilot Training services on or around 31 Mar 15. This acquisition will be solicited via the FedBizOpps website (FedBizOpps.gov) as a full and open opportunity with a requirement for a subcontracting plan from large business offerors in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The government intends to establish a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) single-award Requirements contract. <br /><br />A Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) process will be used for this source selection IAW FAR 15.101-2 and FAR 15.3, as supplemented by DFARS and AFFARS. The government will select the proposal with the lowest evaluated price from among those meeting the acceptability standards for non-price factors. A contract may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in IAW FAR 9.1, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements, and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors, to represent the lowest price technically acceptable proposal.</p>
<p>The offeror must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database before an award can be made to them. If the offeror is not registered in the SAM, it may do so through the SAM website at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.</p>
<p>The planned period of performance is as follows:</p>
<p>Base Period (1 Oct 15 - 30 Sep 16)<br />Option Period 1 (1 Oct 16 - 30 Sep 17)<br />Option Period 2 (1 Oct 17 - 30 Sep 18)<br />Option Period 3 (1 Oct 18 - 30 Sep 19)<br />Option Period 4 (1 Oct 19 - 30 Sep 20)</p>
<p>Please note that all dates listed in this synopsis are tentative and are subject to change.</p>

<a href="mailto:rosalia.toberman-1@nasa.gov">Rosalia  Toberman</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/AFRC has a requirement for 2 each Hermetically Sealed Canisters with Trailing Cones for the installation of atmospheric science instrumentation and atmospheric sensors on the NASA DC-8 Airborne Science Platform.  The specific requirement is in support of the High Ice Water Content (HIWC) project and scheduled HIWC deployment to be conducted during August 10-31, 2015. <p> NASA/AFRC intends to purchase the items directly from Stratton Park Engineering (SPEC, Inc.), 3022 Sterling Circle, #200, Boulder, CO 80301.  The items are to be manufactured by SPEC, Inc. in accordance with SPEC Drawing Number 122-1000.	 Limited Competition Justification.  Authority for the requirement is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2)  Only one responsible source.	Justification is based upon the following facts: 1.	The SPEC hermetically sealed canister(s) have been previously flight qualified by NASA AFRC for installation on the NASA DC-8 wing-tip pylon. 2.	The DC-8 pylon structure (including the interfacing hardware, fittings, and sled) were designed to install SPEC canisters in-order to support previous deployments and science objectives; and 3.	SPEC Inc. is the only known vendor that provides the specific hermetically sealed canister(s) that fits the currently configured NASA DC-8 wing pylon. To use canisters of different size or with different electrical interfaces, the government would have to spend considerable time and money (e.g. for non-recurring design engineering, flight qualification, and verification and validation costs) to modify the existing DC-8 pylon structure. Based upon the above, utilization of any other supplier in-lieu of SPEC Inc. for the hermetically sealed canister(s) would likely result in: a) substantial duplication of cost (i.e. NRE) costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.  These reasons justify procuring the required services exclusively from SPEC Inc. <P> <p> The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. PDT on 03/16/2015. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <p> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <p> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <p> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A> 	. <p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, on behalf of Project Director Joint Products, intends to issue a competitive Request For Proposal (RFP), W52P1J-13-R-0172, on or after 25 March 2015 with an estimated closing date of 45 days after issuance. The RFP for BLU-109 Empty Case Assemblies, CNU-417 Containers, and MHU-212 Pallets is restricted to competition within the National Technology Industrial Base (NTIB), U.S. and Canadian firms, using a best value evaluation approach in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.101-1.  The following items will be solicited: <br>  <br> ITEM:                                NSN:              P/N:  <br> BLU-109C/B              1325-01-585-5698      200827956 <br> BLU-109/B               1325-01-335-8828      8463170-110 <br> BLU-109A/B              1325-01-368-3474      8463170-150 <br> CNU-417/E               8140-01-252-7060      8463244 <br> MHU-212B/E              8140-01-590-4731      3728AS200 <br>  <br> The applicable NAICS code is 332993, Ammunition (Except Small Arms) Manufacturing, with a size standard of 1,500 employees. The RFP will solicit proposals for up to two (2) Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  A total guaranteed minimum quantity of 1,500 empty case assemblies (combined total of 3 configurations) is anticipated to be divided on an 80%/20% basis with associated containers and pallets divided in the same manner; however, the Government will reserve the right to award only one contract for 100% of the total guaranteed minimum quantity if two contract awards are not determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  If two IDIQ contract awards are made, due to the limited requirements of the BLU-109/B and the BLU-109A/B in Fiscal Year (FY) 15, those quantities along with their associated containers/pallets will not be divided but will be awarded entirely to the 80% awardee.  If two IDIQ contract awards are made, the 20% awardee will be guaranteed a minimum quantity of 300 BLU-109C/B units and the 80% awardee will be guaranteed 1,200 units of any combination of BLU-109/B, BLU-109A/B, and BLU-109C/B units.  Each contract will consist of five (5) Ordering Periods to award FY15-FY19 requirements.   <br>  <br> If two IDIQ contract awards are made, future requirements will be competed between the IDIQ contract awardees following the fair opportunity process described in FAR 16.505(b)(1).  Ordering procedures and selection criteria for Delivery Order competitions will be identified in the solicitation and contracts.  Both contracts will allow for award of any empty case assembly configuration and shipping container.  The Government will reserve the right to divide future requirements on any basis and combination as determined to be in the best interest of the Government, and will reserve the right to award future requirements to a single contractor if determined to be in the best interest of the Government considering price and other factors such as contractor performance and capacity. <br>  <br> The total 5 year maximum quantities for all contracts awarded as a result of the RFP are as follows:  BLU-109C/B: 25,000 ea; BLU-109/B: 5,000 ea; BLU-109A/B: 5,000 ea; CNU-417/E: 18,000 ea; and MHU-212B/E: 3,000 ea.  If only one IDIQ contract award is made, that contract will include 100% of the stated maximum quantities.  If two IDIQ contract awards are made, those contracts will include 80% or 20% of the stated maximum quantities for each item, the percentage corresponding to each contractor's share of the total guaranteed minimum quantity. <br>  <br> First Article Test (FAT) will be required. Offerors are required to provide a FAT report (Contractor Testing) within 300 days after award for the BLU-109C/B, BLU-109/B, BLU-109A/B, and the CNU-417/E.  FAT samples will be required for Government Testing of the MHU-212B/E Pallet within 270 days after contract award. Production deliveries are required to begin within 90 days after FAT approval for all items, estimated at 420 days after contract award.  However, if FAT is waived for any item, production deliveries will be required to begin within 180 days after contract award for that item.  Monthly production delivery schedules will be based upon a twelve month delivery period for the awarded quantity, with maximum monthly production capacities specified in Section B of the RFP. <br>  <br> The Technical Data Packages (TDP) for the BLU-109C/B, BLU-109/B, BLU-109A/B, and CNU-417/E are applied Distribution Statement D, distribution is authorized to U.S. Government Agencies and their contractors only due to Critical Technology, and contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act.  The TDP for the MHU-212B/E is Distribution Statement A, approved for public release and distribution is unlimited.

<RESPDATE>032515
<CONTACT>Ronald Stephen Sanford, Phone 3016199330, Email ronald.sanford@med.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Pulsar Informatics, Inc.; 3401 Market St STE 318, Philadelphia, PA 19104; for the performance of a research and development (R&amp;D) project in support of the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), Silver Spring, MD. The research project will fulfill a critical need to provide a validated submarine based scheduling tool for incorporation into the Non-Tactical Data Processing System (NTDPS) within Virginia Class Submarines. The estimated period of performance of the project is 36 months.
<p>The validated submarine based fatigue-based scheduling tool is a follow on effort performed by Pulsar Informatics, Inc., and funded by both the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Advanced Medical Development (AMD) Program. Pulsar Informatics (Pulsar) is the only company that has integrated submarine-specific operational challenges and directly addressed the needs of submarine operations. No other examples exist that have addressed the impacts of interrupted sleep and rapidly changing operational tempo for watchbill generation for submarine crews, an entirely novel and particularly challenging problem for the submarine force. Pulsar is the only entity to have conducted the prior, ONR and AMD funded effort, which successfully created a proof of concept software architecture to 1) monitor submariner training qualifications; 2) track individual watchstander work/rest cycles; 3) integrate information from watch sections to design "watchbills" comprising multiple watch section; and, 4) optimize submarine crew schedules by providing fatigue countermeasures and real-time capability to immediately adjust rescheduling of watchbills.</p>
<p>The two main objectives of the anticipated project are to: (1) transition and perform a knowledge transfer of the submarine-specific scheduling system into the new Virginia Class Submarine NTDPS system (named NOSIS); and (2) create a fatigue assessment component and fatigue meter dashboard for the Pulsar stand-alone software tool. In addition to the primary two tasks, a final field evaluation, validation and fine tuning of the software product will be required prior to implementation.</p>
<p>Pulsar Informatics (Pulsar) created a US Navy Submarine-specific-scheduling and fatigue system as one previously did not exist. This submarine-specific tool captures individualized fatigue-based scheduling that can scale up from the individual watch-stander at the watch station to the watch sections' integration of fatigue. Their efforts have culminated in a stand-alone software tool. It is the only tool that includes watch station breakdown, along with watch section integration of the information. In this system, fatigue components are based on individual Submariners, which makes it the only software on the market that has accounted for submarine watch-stander positions while providing the ability to build and redesign watch schedules in real time. Additionally, Pulsar has produced the only submarine-specific scheduling and fatigue mitigation software. All these points indicate that Pulsar is qualified and has the capability to perform the work successfully. A sources sought notice was issued on 29 January 2015 for this requirement and the Government determined after the review of capability statements, that no other source had the capability to perform the required work.</p>
<p>This notice of intent&nbsp;is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 1 (8.5 x 11 inch) page and shall be submitted in 12 point, Times New Roman font. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed with a sole source contract.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due by 5:00 PM Local Time, March 25, 2015. Capability statements shall be submitted by e-mail ONLY as a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF attachment to the following address: NMLC-Research@med.navy.mil.</p>

<SUBJECT>TRICARE Quality Monitoring Contract (TQMC) Draft Solicitation
<SOLNBR>HT9402-15-R-0005
<RESPDATE>032415
<CONTACT>Cynthia Turk, Contract Specialist, Email cynthia.d.turk.civ@mail.mil - Mike Sharpe, Contract Analyst, Email Michael.Sharpe.ctr@dha.mil
<DESC>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is contemplating a new indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with fixed unit prices for the TRICARE Quality Monitoring Contract (TQMC). The TQMC will assist the Clinical Support Division (CSD) in assessing and improving the quality of care delivered under the TRICARE benefit across the direct and purchased care systems and support DHA with the management of clinical quality performance measurements to validate the quality of care.
<p>The purpose of this Notice is to provide potential offerors with sections of the DRAFT request for proposal (RFP) for the TQMC. This Notice is a follow on to&nbsp;earlier Requests for Information (RFIs) (DHA-RFI-15-CQSS and DHA-RFI-14-CQMP) and is part of ongoing market research. It is intended solely for information and planning purposes and is NOT a solicitation. Offerors are invited to review the attached DRAFT solicitation documents and submit questions or comments about the DRAFT RFP via email to Ms. Cynthia Turk, Contract Specialist, cynthia.d.turk.civ@mail.mil, not later than March 24,2015. Please include the following in the subject line: DRAFT TQMC HT9402-15-R-0005.</p>
<p>DHA seeks industry questions and feedback on the adequacy of the description of the TQMC requirements and DHA's approach in the draft RFP sections attached to this draft solicitation. DHA requests industry input concerning healthcare best practices, industry standards, and incentives to promote the delivery of high clinical quality monitoring services within the applicable statutory and regulatory limitations.</p>
<p>DHA requests responders submit any questions or comments about the DRAFT RFP via email to Ms Turk. Interested firms shall not send proposals in response to this Notice, nor shall they contact any other individuals about this Notice or the TQMC requirement.

<p>DHA requests that responders identify the specific solicitation document and cite specific paragraphs where appropriate, using the Word file attached to this DRAFT solicitation. DHA will treat all questions/comments as source selection information (FAR 2.101 &amp; 3.104).</p>
<p>DHA is not issuing a solicitation at this time, and this Notice shall not be construed as DHA's commitment to issue a solicitation nor does it restrict DHA to a particular acquisition approach.

<p>BACKGROUND: The DHA's mission is to achieve greater integration of the direct and purchased health care delivery systems to accomplish the Military Health System's (MHS) Quadruple Aim: Readiness, Population Health, Experience of Care and Per Capita Cost. DHA is tasked with making military medicine stronger, better and more relevant for the future. The Health Systems Performance Branch, Clinical Support Division, under the Health Operations Directorate, is responsible for overseeing the quality of healthcare provided throughout the MHS. The MHS has a $50 billion budget and serves about 9.5 million beneficiaries. The MHS consists of two major care delivery systems: Direct care is provided in military treatment facilities (MTFs). Currently, there are 430 MTFs: 54 military hospitals and 373 military medical clinics around the world. Purchased care is provided by contractors, including the Designated Providers (DP) under the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan (USFHP), the managed care support contractors (MCSCs), the TRICARE Overseas Program (TOP) contractor, the TRICARE Dual Eligible Fiscal Intermediary Contract (TDEFIC), and pharmacy contractor.</p>
<p>The TQMC will enable DHA to implement proven clinical and business practices more rapidly, and reduce unwarranted variation, creating the conditions for learning and continuous improvement across the MHS. The TQMC contractor will support the DHA in managing clinical quality measures and functions; perform quality management activities to validate the quality of care delivered to TRICARE beneficiaries; and compile and compare DHA quality data with national performance and available benchmarks while supporting MHS compliance with healthcare mandates.</p>
<p>The TQMC is anticipated to perform the non-personal advisory and assistance services (A&amp;AS) and non-A&amp;AS tasks listed below in accordance with TRICARE's Quality and Utilization Peer Review Organization Program (Code of Federal Regulations 32 CFR 199.15) and DoD Instruction and Manual 6025.13, Medical Quality Assurance and Clinical Quality Management in the Military Health System, and TRICARE manuals (http://manuals.tricare.osd.mil/):<br />&bull; Perform contract oversight and management of all TQMC requirements as the prime contractor. <br />&bull; Implement effective quality control program equivalent to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2008 and other healthcare best practices and standards.<br />&bull; Review clinical performance studies which DHA identifies as having significant importance to the MHS mission and beneficiaries. <br />&bull; Collect, analyze and display MHS clinical quality measures data with nationally comparable benchmarks in support of the MHS Strategic Plan, <br />&bull; Collect, analyze National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) compliance audits.<br />&bull; Collect, submit and present the Joint Commission (JC) ORYX&reg; National Hospital Quality Measures data for comparative analysis with healthcare organizations nationwide and to support the accreditation of Department of Defense (DoD) hospitals,<br />&bull; Conduct independent medical peer reviews for Standard of Care (SOC) cases at 54 Military Treatment Facility (MTF); conduct medical necessity (Reconsideration) reviews (Second Level Appeals); and provide independent and impartial evaluations of the healthcare provided to MHS beneficiaries and other medical peer review services to support DHA's oversight of clinical quality in the MHS as mandated by 32 CFR 199.15, Quality and Utilization Review Peer Review Organization Program; Part 199, Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). <br />&bull; Use the IHI Global Trigger Tool (GTT) to conduct medical record reviews to identify possible adverse events.<br />&bull; Provide clinical/expert witnesses for medical appeal administrative hearings and proceedings; <br />&bull; Assess evolving practices, devices, medicines, treatments and procedures; <br />&bull; Conduct initial certification/re-certifications of TRICARE-authorized freestanding partial hospitalization programs (PHP); residential treatment centers (RTC); substance use disorder rehabilitation facilities (SUDRF).<br />&bull; Conduct quality improvement studies based on information gathered from DHA leadership including the Services, the Managed Care Support Contractors and other contractors; current trends in the healthcare industry with reference to the application to the MHS and findings from previously performed focused studies performed in the MHS or the results of outcome measures from MHS data.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering  and  Expeditionary Warfare Center (EXWC) in Port Hueneme, California intends to solicit expert review from industry-leading subject matter experts (SMEs), who have a demonstrated background in the use of state-of-the-art and innovative techniques for treating impacted sites.  The resultant contractor will review past history and current status at up to 38 sites across the United States; and will submit a technical report on their findings and recommendations on appropriate innovations and advancements in the environmental industry that would allow the Navy to achieve improved risk reduction at legacy impacted sites across the United States.

EXWC is assisting NAVFAC Headquarters (HQ) in reviewing the Navys legacy impacted sites that have particularly challenging and persistent technical, regulatory, and administrative issues.
  NAVFAC HQ has identified up to 38 sites with soil and groundwater impacts where innovative technologies and innovative methods could be used to improve the Navys approach towards treating soil and groundwater in a more timely and cost effective fashion.

The Navy will conduct an initial review of the selected sites and create a Site Summary profile.  The Site Summary, along with available site documents (i.e., Remedial Investigation, Record of Decision, Remedial Design, Remedial Action, long-term monitoring reports), will be posted to a shared website for retrieval.

The type of contract anticipated is Firm Fixed Price (FFP).  The solicitation will be a 100% Small Business Set-aside and is identified under NAICS Code 541620 with a small business size of $15M.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Japan District (JED) is providing a PRE-SOLICITATION Notice for an upcoming Design-Build (D-B) Construction Project titled: FY14 ECIP P311 Energy-Steam Decentralization, CFA, Sasebo, Japan.  This announcement is NOT the solicitation but rather the notification for an upcoming solicitation as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 36.213-2. <br>  <br> NOTICE:  Only local sources will be considered under this solicitation.  Local sources are sources (e.g. corporations, partnerships, or Joint Ventures [For a Joint Venture, the Joint Venture as an independent entity must satisfy the local source requirements or, in the alternative, each member of the Joint Venture must individually satisfy the local source requirements]) that are physically located in Japan and authorized (i.e. licensed and registered) to perform in Japan, the type of construction work specified in this solicitation.  Specifically, a prospective offeror must be duly authorized to operate and conduct business in Japan and must fully comply with all laws, decrees, labor standards, and regulations of Japan during the performance of the resulting contract.  In addition, prior to award of the contract, offeror must be registered with the Government of Japan to do construction work in Japan and possess necessary construction licenses and permits to perform work required under this solicitation.   <br>  <br> PROJECT INFORMATION:  This project will replace existing steam consuming domestic hot water and space heating equipment with electrically driven heat pump systems in 30 buildings located at Commander, U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo (CFAS).  In two (2) of the buildings, steam consuming absorption chillers will be replaced with winter space heating and summer space cooling heat pump systems.  When the installation of the heat pump heating/cooling systems have been completed, two (2) central steam plants, including the fuel oil storage tanks at each site, will be demolished.  The existing exterior steam distribution system will be blind flanged, secured at finished grade, and abandoned in place.  Within the 30 facilities to be upgraded, steam system components that are not reused may be removed or secured and abandoned in place, depending on feasibility, accessibility, and/or operability, in coordination with the new system.  To the maximum extent possible, building infrastructure (hot water tanks, supply and return headers, piping, valves, etc) will be retained and re-used in the proposed heat pump systems.  Where existing facilities or processes require steam and cannot reasonably be converted to a non-steam system, new electric steam boilers will be provided.  This project will restore any interior surface affected by the installation of the heat pump heating/cooling systems.  Restoration may include ceiling, wall, and roofing repairs, furring to accommodate mechanical piping and electrical wiring.  New space heating and cooling equipment will communicate via direct digital controls (DDC) over existing Lon Works communication infrastructure.  Lon Works Network Services (LNS) will be used for all network management including addressing and building of network variables.  Control sequence logic will reside in DDC hardward in the building.  The building control network will not be dependent upon connection to a Utility Monitoring and Control System (UMCS) for performance of control.  Electrical utility upgrades to individual facilities may include new increased capacity electrical feeders, upgraded transformers, and service panel retrofits, as necessary to accommodate the increase in electrical load resulting from the installation of the proposed heat pump systems.  Anti-Terrorism Force Protection (ATFP) work includes isolation dampers for building duct systems that are renovated under the project.  Operations and maintenance support manuals and on site operational instruction for new systems will be provided.  <br>  <br> The Government intends to issue a solicitation in March 2015.  The magnitude of this project is between 1,000,000,000 Japanese Yen and 2,500,000,000 Japanese Yen. <br>   <br> SOLICITATION INFORMATION: <br>  <br> 1. Traditional hard copies of plans and specifications will not be available for this project. Solicitation documents, including amendments, will be posted in Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) webpage for interested parties to download.  It is the responsibility of interested parties to check FedBizOpps as to whether the solicitation and/or amendment(s) have been issued.   <br>  <br> 2. Companies that have not submitted Bidders Mailing List Application to this office on or after April 2005 are requested to go to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Japan Engineer District, Contracting Division website (http://www.poj.usace.army.mil/BusinessWithUs/GettingStarted.aspx) to download the Bidders Mailing List Application.

ii.	Room and Board. Room and board shall include a bed and other furnishings such as a dresser, storage, and personal linens (towels and bed sheets).

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), in support of Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment of the Program Executive Office Soldier, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060 is seeking information from potential industry partners to support the Army's next generation protection system called Soldier Protection System Torso and Extremity Protection (SPS TEP). <br>  <br> Background.  An operational need exists to provide the Soldier a personal protective system that allows the user to tailor his/her loads for mission-specific operations, thereby increasing survivability and mobility. The goal of SPS TEP is to provide the Soldiers with modular and scalable/mission-tailorable protection to reduce weight and increase mobility while optimizing protection. Currently the Army is in the final development stage that will down select between four (4) designs to go into Low Rate Initial Production/Full Rate Production (LRIP/FRP).  The Government design consists of four (4) components, the torso vest, the BCS, the load distribution system, and the pelvic protection system.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), in support of Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment of the Program Executive Office Soldier, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060 is seeking information from potential industry partners to support the Army's next generation protection system called Soldier Protection System Torso and Extremity Protection (SPS TEP). <br>  <br> Background.  An operational need exists to provide the Soldier a personal protective system that allows the user to tailor his/her loads for mission-specific operations, thereby increasing survivability and mobility. The goal of SPS TEP is to provide the Soldiers with modular and scalable/mission-tailorable protection to reduce weight and increase mobility while optimizing protection. Currently the Army is in the final development stage that will down select between four (4) designs to go into Low Rate Initial Production/Full Rate Production (LRIP/FRP).  The Government design consists of four (4) components, the torso vest, the BCS, the load distribution system, and the pelvic protection system.  If the Government design, one of the four designs, is selected then the Government will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the POG to go into LRIP/FRP.  <br>  <br> This RFI is to gather information specific to producing the pelvic protection system component for the Government design if it is selected for LRIP/FRP, specifically the Protective Outer Garment (POG).

Services will be provided in Mexico City, as well as other states located throughout the Mexican Republic.<br /><br />Interpretation services will be required at a variety of venues (formal and informal) and in both structured and unstructured settings.  For example, one customer may have a requirement for interpretation services in a classroom setting or at a formal government function, while another customer may have a requirement for interpretation services at a firing range, driving track or other tactical skills event.<br /><br />Given the breadth of the programs and initiatives the U.S. Embassy supports, interpretation services will be required for a wide range of subject matters.  Although not all inclusive, examples of areas where interpretation services may be required follow:<br /><br />Areas related to Security, including general security services; protection of high-ranking officials; law enforcement and firearms; and cyber security.  Areas related to Science, Health, and Medicine, including regulation of medical products; human foods; animal feeds; tobacco products; food and drug quality and safety; and public health.  Areas related to Economics, Trade, and Development, including imports and exports; government regulations; infrastructure; land, air and sea transportation; labor issues; and competition.  Areas related to Politics and International Relations, including political parties; elections; bilateral and multilateral agreements; and human rights.  Areas related to Law, including legal systems; constitutional reforms; citizens' rights; and fugitive investigations.  Areas related to Military, including general military terminology; armed forces agreements; rules of engagement; training and cooperation; command and control; military justice and intelligence; weapons and weapons systems; aviation operations and maintenance; and logistics.<br /><br />Due to the technical nature and complexity of some of the requirements, the contractor must be capable of conducting the necessary research and performing the analysis required to be able to appropriately understand and correctly interpret the varying types of subject matter.  This includes understanding the terminology and nuances that may be unique to a specific area of expertise.<br /><br />To be able to effectively provide the services, the contractor will also be responsible for providing the necessary interpretation equipment.  This, for example, includes headsets, microphones, translation booths, sound systems, and body-packs with transmitters.  Services will also require the ability to take on multiple projects at the same time and to provide services on short notice when required.  For example, an unplanned visit by foreign dignitaries with limited advance notice, where interpretation services are required for a briefing to be provided to the visitors.<br /><br />Specific qualifications as they pertain to this sources sought notice include the following:
<p><br />Past experience providing Spanish to English and English to Spanish interpretation services in Mexico (in Standard Mexican Spanish); the capability to 1) provide highly qualified interpretation personnel possessing a level 5 Language Advanced Professional Proficiency in both English and Spanish; 2) effectively provide services for wide-ranging technical and complex subject matters (i.e., tailor services to meet the specific needs); 3) quickly adapt to constantly changing circumstances, personalities, and work environments; 4) adjust to the demands of diplomatic protocol, protective security requirements, and similar considerations; 5) handle multiple requirements at the same time and at varying locations; 6) respond quickly to both standard and non-standard (emergency) services; 7) provide the necessary equipment; and 8) effectively manage, supervise and coordinate contractor resources and efforts.<br /><br />Interested U.S. small business concerns capable of meeting the above requirements are invited to submit a Capability Statement by emailing the contracting officer LindquistRA@state.gov.  Subject line shall read Sources Sought for Mexico Interpretation Services.  The Capability Statement, not to exceed 15 pages, must include the company's name, DUNS number, point of contact information, and Small Business Status (e.g. Small, SDVOSB, WOSB, HUBZone, etc.).  In determining the capability of meeting the above requirements, small business concerns must take into consideration subcontracting limitations established by Federal regulations.<br /><br />General expressions of interest and/or prior experience in providing interpretation services are not being solicited.  Only capability statements that address the specific qualifications identified in this notice will be considered.<br /><br />NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  ONLY WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE (PREFERABLY BY E-MAIL) WILL BE CONSIDERED.</p>

The USCG HC-27J Spartan Maritime Patrol Aircraft are operated differently from general aviation in support of such Coast Guard missions as: Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, Logistic Support, and Law Enforcement Missions. These missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and other components. The aircraft, the engines and their components are inspected by USCG personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).<br /><br />USCG OBJECTIVES:<br />To establish a three year, firm-fixed price contract to purchase aircraft parts (see listing). Only the exact part numbers listed in the schedule will be accepted. This requirement must be restricted to authorized sources of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or firms who can effectively demonstrate their ability to provide the components and obtain the proprietary data required meeting form, fit, and function of the units. The USCG requires that distributors or other potential sources be ITAR certified, ASA-100 certified, or in compliance with other quality systems listed in FAA Advisory Circular 00-56A.These requirements are necessary in order for the USCG to maintain the capability to adequately support all USCG missions.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:
<p>This is not a request for proposals. This synopsis is for information, planning and market research purposes only. This is not a solicitation announcement and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. Small and disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to provide input.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Through the National Defense Authorization Act of 2014, the Coast Guard has acquired 14 C-27J aircraft from the US Air Force. The C-27J is a medium size military transport aircraft that is manufactured by Alenia Aermacchi (Italy). CG-9 established the C-27J Asset Project Office (APO) Elizabeth City to make these aircraft ready for Coast Guard use. The C-27J APO will support the oversight of the process from acquisition and missionization of the C-27J to sustainment. The Coast Guard HC-27J will operate differently from general aviation in support of Coast Guard missions such as: Search &amp; Rescue, Surveillance, Logistic Support, and Law Enforcement Missions. These missions require frequent operation at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments which accelerate corrosion on airframe structures, engines and other components. The aircraft, the engines and their components are inspected by Coast Guard personnel in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) periodic requirements and in conjunction with the USCG's specialized Asset Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).</p>
<p>USCG OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>This notice is to assist the Coast Guard in determining potential sources for HC-27J aircraft parts (see listing).Only new and exact part numbers listed in the schedule will be accepted. This requirement must be restricted to authorized sources of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or firms who can effectively demonstrate their ability to provide Full Traceability back to OEM. Drawings or specifications are not available, and cannot be furnished by the Government. All companies that can provide the items are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company cage code, brochures, or any other information demonstrating that the items can be provided. This notice is to assist the Coast Guard in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. Reimbursement will not be made for any costs associated with providing information to this sources sought.</p>
<p>REPLIES:</p>
<p>Responses to this notice should include company name, address, and telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product details, brochures, etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options. Please state the approximate lead-time for acquiring your product and the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the product. Responses can be for all or for a few of the part numbers listed.</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS code is 336413- Aircraft assemblies, subassemblies, and parts (except engines) manufacturing. Please respond to the following questions (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, provide POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions. After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published on FedBizOpps. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source <br />The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA) intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, a non-commercial procurement with PKL Services, Inc. (hereafter referred to as PKL). The objective is to continue the current services with PKL. Under the proposed procurement PKL will provide technical services to train personnel in aircraft maintenance and supporting logistics specialties for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) F-15 C/D/S Aircraft. Performance is in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at the King Khalid Training Center (KKTC). The current contract includes providing RSAF students F-15C/D/S model aircraft specialty Upgrade Training (UGT) from a 3-skill level to a 5-skill level, proficiency qualification, and 7-skill level training. The technicians receiving UGT training will include the following specialties: Integrated Avionics Systems (2A3X4B), Tactical Aircraft Maintenance (Crew Chiefs) (2A3X3), Propulsion/Engines (2A6X1E), Electrical/Environmental (2A6X6), Aircraft Armament Systems (2W1X1), Aerospace Ground Equipment (2A6X2), Egress (2A6X3), Fuels (2A6X4), Hydraulics (2A6X5), Non-Destructive Inspection (2A7X2), Aircraft Structures (2A7X3), Maintenance Management (2R1X1), Maintenance Management Analysis (2R0X1), Aircrew Flight Equipment (1P0X1), Avionics Test Stations (2A0X1S), Avionics Test Stations (2A0X1M), Metals Technology (2A7X1), PMEL (2P0X1), Munitions (2W0X1), Supply (2S0X1), and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) (3E8X1). The follow-on competitive acquisition is in progress with an estimated award date August 2016. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation no later than March 31, 2015, noon local time, which shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Florence Taplin, Contracting Officer/Specialist, e-mail: florence.taplin.1@us.af.mil.
<p>The contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>a. As the service provider for the past two years, PKL is uniquely positioned for the continued performance of F-15C/D/S model aircraft specialty UGT, for RSAF students. PKL is the only company with the personnel, tools, equipment and material currently mobilized to KSA that can perform these essential, mission-critical services at KKTC. As the incumbent contractor, PKL is the only contractor with a complete understanding of the requirements and capability to maintain the level of UGT service required at KKTC.</p>
<p>b. PKL will ensure seamless continued performance without mission failure until such time as the Government can complete its competitive source selection, award a follow-on contract, and provide enough time for an estimated 120-180 day mobilization period. Award to any other contractor, other than the incumbent, will require a substantial mobilization period to adhere to all the Saudi labor laws and Work Visa / Iqama processes.</p>
<p>c. PKL is the only practical source capable of providing the services described in section III above without the Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source
<p><br />Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, intends to negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for MasterKey and MSC Nastran licenses and support in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 15.2, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. The contract will be awarded to immix Technology, Inc. Market research was previously conducted and it has been determined that this is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide timely and effective services within two (2) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted with only one respondent able to meet the government's needs due to the information being proprietary: immix Technology, Inc. Ms. Jill Willingham-Allen, AFLCMC/AQP, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 45433, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

Accordingly, the Ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process and, therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the buyer at the telephone number listed herein. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Negotiator, Denise Smith at (937) 656-7371 or e-mail: denise.smith.2@us.af.mil.

<DESC><p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source Synopsis published for informational purposes only. <br />This proposed action is for the procurement of a Free-Space Measurement Platform.&nbsp; <br />The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339114 - Optical Test and Inspection Equipment Manufacturing. Business size standard for NAICS code 339114 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Thomas Keating Ltd, Station Mills, Daux Road, Billingshurst, West Sussex, RH149SH, United Kingdom. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 5:00 p.m.&nbsp; Local Time (Wright-Patterson AFB), Thursday, 12 March 2015. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Requirement:</p>
<p>The requirements are for the augmentation of a free-space measurement platform capable of integration with a mm-wave VNA system (Agilent model number N5251A), which would enable a stable measurement at frequencies between 18 GHz and 110 GHz and fit within required space constraints (1500 mm x 2000 mm x 500 mm).&nbsp; The antenna horns should be corrugated and produce a super- or ultra-Gaussian microwave/millimeter wave, and combined with the associated sample holder, should allow for repeatable polarization measurements.&nbsp; When combined with the N5251A and associated materials measurement software it should enable the measurement of the scattering matrix of a material (S11, S22, S21 and S12) as well as its permeability and permittivity.</p>
<p>System Specifications:</p>
<p>- Must consist of a compatible upgrade and extension of capabilities to operate in parallel with an existing TK Ltd Quasi-Optical bench.<br />- Needs to fit within available space constraints.&nbsp; (Must be less than 2000 mm x 1500 mm x 500 mm, L x W x H)<br />- Corrugated horn antennas, producing a super or ultra-Gaussian wave and with anti-cocking flanges made to custom specifications.&nbsp; <br />- Dielectric-free beam path<br />- Allow for highly precise and repeatable polarization measurements.<br />- Precision machined mountings for positioning of elements enabling use at frequencies of 18 GHz and higher.<br />- Completed setup must have corrugated horn antennas which operate in the K-band and Ka-band, and must be compatible with our existing U-band, V-band, and W-band corrugated horns or provide horns that function in those frequency bands.<br />- Must include coaxial to waveguide adapters to couple to all horns, or must connect directly to 2.92 mm female, 2.4 mm female, 1.85 mm female, 1.00 mm female, and 1.00 mm female connectors for horns operating in the K, Ka, U, V, and W bands, respectively.<br />- Must be capable of linear and cross polarization measurements in both transmission and reflection modes in at least the K and Ka-bands.<br />- Free space measurement capable.&nbsp; <br />- Rotatable sample holder with adjustable thickness enabling measurements of samples of various thicknesses.<br />- Compatible with Agilent's mm-wave VNA system, model number N5251A and associated materials measurement software to provide scattering matrix (S11, S22, S21, S12), permeability, and permittivity measurements.<br />- Cross polar loss of better than 24.25 dB<br />- Higher Order Loss of Better than 27 dB<br />- Required sample size of at most 11-15/16" x 11-15/16"<br />- Must be mountable to an optics table with M6 holes on a 25 mm x 25 mm grid.<br />- Must be constructed from non-magnetic materials (e.g., Aluminum, Copper, 316 Stainless Steel)<br />- A failure to meet any of the provided requirements is considered a critical failure of the item.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Thomas Keating Ltd is the only system that can ensure uniformity of results with previous measurements.&nbsp; The requirements must consist of a compatible upgrade and extension of capabilities to operate in parallel with an existing Thomas Keating Ltd Quasi-Optical bench.&nbsp; If these items are not purchased, it would be considered a critical failure and using a different manufacturer would not meet the technical specifications, would involve retraining; and redesigning the measurement processes would involve producing a new set up from scratch which would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD.&nbsp; Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012.&nbsp; You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to Robin.Smith.4@us.af.mil&nbsp; no later than 5:00 p.m. Local Time (Wright-Patterson AFB), Thursday, 12 March 2015. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>
<p>Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "FA8601-15-T-0111, Free-Space Measurement Platform." Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files).&nbsp; Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters.&nbsp; Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB.&nbsp; If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent.&nbsp; The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

Services will be required to begin on 01 April 2015 and extend through 30 September 2015, for a period of 6 months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Being that these services expire in such short notice there is not sufficient time to competitively procure these services and for another contractor to be able to sufficiently recruit workers, familiarize themselves with the local marketplace, MTF policies, points of contact, and scope of work within the amount of time left to avoid a lapse in service or disruption to the hospital.<br /><br />Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to award a bridge contract to Symtech Corporation, Cage Code: 030A5 being that they are the only source available to meet the Government&rsquo;s needs in the time available. Market research was performed and based on the information obtained by the government it was determined that this company is the only source to provide the required services without disruption to the facility. Symtech, as the incumbent contractor, will be able to provide a smooth transition between the contracts, as they would not need to recruit workers because they already have services in place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This would also limit the impact of administrative burden on the Government processing new candidate packages and providing orientation.

<p><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services <br />Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Thermo Scientific, 5225 Verona Road, Madison, WI 53711 for associated equipment that will be integrated with FBI owned scanning electron microscopes.</p>
<p>The FBI currently owns JEOL Scanning Electron Microscopes. To accomplish the task of analyzing improvised explosives to assist in determining their safety properties these microscopes will be fabricated with a Thermo Scientific electron backscatter diffraction detector and a Thermo Scientific Noran UltraDry electron dispersive spectrometry (EDS) detector integrated into Thermo Scientifics' NORAN System 7 Microanalysis System. This system is configured to support completely integrated EDAS, EBSD, wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS), and forescatter detectors. This will give the FBI the capability to prove that a certain chemical synthesis methodology has yielded the correct crystal structure and chemical composition for the desired end-product explosive. <br /><br />Thermo Scientific is the only vendor who meets the strict technical requirements of the equipment needed that will be integrated with the FBI owned SEM's. Furthermore, the accessories must completely and seamlessly integrate into the Thermo Scientific NORAN System 7 X-ray microanalysis system that will be installed on the FBI owned JEOL JSM-IT300LV SEM. Thermo Scientific is the sole-manufacturer and supplier of this equipment and is the only vendor that can satisfy the requirements of the FBI.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by Thermo Scientific as they are the sole-manufacturer and supplier of this equipment.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 08:00 am, EST, March 16, 2015, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

The Department of Energy (DOE) intends to issue a noncompetitive modification to Contract Number DE-DT0000088 to extend the period of performance for up to nine (9) months, (one six (6) month base and one three (3) month option) in support of activities involving the continuation to provide health-related technical and administrative support to the Office of the Associate Under Secretary for Environment, Health, Safety and Security (AU). The period of performance will be extended from March 26, 2015 through December 25, 2015.
The DOE?s AU has a requirement for immediate continuation of support to their mission. Unanticipated delays, due to protests and corrective action received from solicitation of the follow-on contract, have created the need to further extend the current contract through December 25, 2015.

The requested extension is the only feasible alternative for obtaining the required services before the contract expires.
This requirement was initially awarded to Project Enhancement Corporation (PEC) to provide health-related technical and administrative support. The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code is 541330; Size Standard is $15 million.
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 U.S.C. ? 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.
SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: Submission of any information in response to this notice is purely voluntary. The Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred. In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency, no later than the closing date and time of this notice.

<DESC><p>In furtherance of the Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) Board of Directors' emphasis to pursue the creation of inmate jobs without mandatory source, this notice announces the intent of the Board to approve FPI to seek additional work in commercial market services, beyond the seven categories of work presently approved, to enable FPI to pursue potential growth opportunities in distribution, logistics, packaging and other services. This proposal will allow FPI to pursue additional commercial service work to provide more inmates with job training opportunities.</p>
<p>In 1998, FPI received approval from its Board of Directors to provide commercial market services. To date, the Board has approved several categories: 1) work that is currently being performed outside the United States; 2) services with a recognized labor shortage that causes companies to outsource work to foreign companies; 3) new services that a company otherwise intends to contract outside the United States; and 4) services that were performed by non-Federal Bureau of Prisons inmates (such as District of Columbia inmates) for non-Federal agencies; 5) service work for state and local governments; 6) service work that would be economically unfeasible to perform without the availability of inmate labor, i.e., new work that would otherwise not be done; and in 2013, a seventh category: work opportunities related to recycling.</p>
<p>Additional service opportunities remain since they may not fit the current framework of one of the previously approved criteria. The Board therefore announces its intention to approve a proposal broadening FPI's existing commercial market service categories to cover other potential service opportunities that do not fit one of the previous categories.</p>
<p>Fully utilizing FPI's ability to identify additional work will assist FPI in its goal to create more inmate jobs. FPI's pursuit of these services should not hinder the development of the domestic market, and FPI will continue to ensure it remains sensitive so that no single industry will bear an undue burden as a result of its efforts. This additional opportunity in commercial market services allows FPI to fully and effectively utilize its current capacity and capabilities while creating more skills training opportunities for inmates.</p>
<p>Interested parties are invited to comment on this notice. Comments will be due within 30 days of the date of publication in the FedBizOpps. All comments received in response to this announcement will be provided to FPI's Board of Directors in their entirety. These comments will be reviewed by the Board prior to making a final decision to proceed, adding the broader pursuit of CMS as outlined herein. Comments should be addressed to: Chief, Marketing, Research, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20534.</p>

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts or quotations. All responses may be used for market analysis in determining the availability of potential qualified businesses for the purposes of determining an appropriate acquisition strategy.<br /><br />The Indian Health Service (IHS) Division of Acquisition Policy (DAP) intends to award a bridge contract to Joslin Diabetes Center, 1 Joslin Avenue, Boston, MA 02215 for continuity of support services. DAP will utilize acquisition procedures under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source" for the Indian Health Service for services and equipment provided by the Joslin Diabetes Center for operation of the IHS-JVN Teleophthalmology Program. This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive proposals. The purpose of this notice is merely to obtain capability statements to allow interested firms an opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for the standards below. <br /><br /><strong>Project Background:<br /></strong>The Joslin Vision Network (JVN) is a specialized teleophthalmology modality for the remote diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy. JVN is a proprietary telemedicine system developed by the Joslin Diabetes Center (JDC) based in Boston. The Comprehensive Diabetes Management Program (CDMP) is a suite of software applications residing on the IHS JVN/CDMP server that provides multiple functions critical to the clinical operation of the JVN including patient management, database maintenance, reporting, quality assurance (QA), RPMS/EHR interoperability, and DICOM image management. As such, the CDMP serves as the platform for clinical operation of the JVN in the IHS and also is being used in a similar fashion by other IHS telemedicine modalities for remote health monitoring. Both the JVN and CDMP were developed as a collaboration of the JDC, DoD, VHA, and the IHS. The software is owned by JDC, but federal funding of its development (in part) established the basis for its royalty/license free use by federal users, in perpetuity. Deployment and use of the JVN system in the IHS allows participating facilities to image the funding of patients with diabetes for the purpose of remote diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The JVN has been deployed nationally at 96 sites in 25 states in Indian country as the IHS-JVN Teleophthalmology Program (IHS-JVN). <br />This program uses the JVN technology to acquire and transmit retinal images from AI/AN's with diabetes. Evaluation of these images by readers at the IHS-JVN National Reading Center allows the remote diagnosis of level of DR and diabetic macular edema (DME) with development of a treatment plan consistent with established standards of care. The program is validated at the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) Category 3, and retinal evaluations by this program qualify for IHS GPRA tallies for annual DR examinations in Indian country. The imaging and reading service is generally reimbursable by Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance companies. The IHS-JVN retains ownership and control of all deployed equipment and is responsible for operational support, maintenance, repairs, and replacement as needed. The IHS-JVN also provides onsite deployment services, training, support, reporting, and QA for all its telemedicine operations.<br /><br /><strong>Project Purpose:</strong><br />The purpose of the contract is to maintain ongoing development, implementation, and support of the IHS-JVN teleophthalmology activities in Indian country with services and equipment. These services and equipment are provided by the Joslin Diabetes Center in accordance with the directed spending language contained in IHS congressional appropriations to support the following telemedicine based activities. For more detailed requirements please refer to the Statement of Work <strong>(Attachment One)</strong>. The period of performance for the proposed bridge contract consists of a base period of six (6) months and an option period of three (3) months period of performance.<br /><br />Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the services required in the timeframe required. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE; THEREFORE, REQUEST OF SUCH DOCUMENT WILL BE CONSIDERED INVALID RESPONSES. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no affirmative responses are received within 7 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with issuance of an award to Joslin Diabetes Center under the authority of 41 United States Code (U.S.C.) 253(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.<br /><br />Qualified firms must also include the following information<br />a.

The Pacific States Marine Fisheries Council (PSMFC) is uniquely qualified to provide the required services because the data that are being collected come from sales receipts that are submitted to state fisheries agencies. These sales receipts are confidential and are owned by the state. PSMFC has access agreements in place (in accordance with the Interstate Compact as approved by Public Law 87-766 and Public Law 91-315) with each state agency to gain access to these data. NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service does not have direct access to the data through the state agencies.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Technical Support for Enhancements to the Food Commodity Database (FCID) JIFSAN Tool
This is to serve as notice that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to make an award to the Joint Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition (JIFSAN) on a sole source basis for nine months from March 18, 2015 to December 31, 2015. The requirements for this service are as follows:
The contractor shall be responsible for completion of four tasks.  A summary of each task is provided below, including the time frame during which the task shall be completed.
Task 1.  The contractor shall establish communication with the EPA Contracting Officer?s Representative (COR).
The contractor shall schedule an initial conference call within 1 week after the receipt of the contract award.  The call shall include the COR, alternate COR, and relevant members of the JIFSAN team.  
Deliverable 1: The contractor shall arrange a conference call with the COR and alternate COR, within 1 week after the contract award.
Task 2:  Prepare Work Plan and Quality Assurance Project Plan 
The contractor shall submit a work plan that describes how the work will be conducted.  The work plan shall include the approach to be used by the contractor to implement the enhancements described in Task 3, a schedule, budget, level of effort, and qualifications of personnel.  The workplan shall include a schedule of deliverables and interim deliverables.
The contractor shall develop a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for this contract for the EPA COR?s and Quality Assurance Manager (QAM) approval.  The workplan and QAPP shall be submitted simultaneously for the approval.  The contractor shall not perform any work under this work assignment until the quality assurance statement is reviewed and approved by the COR and QAM.
The contractor must document in the QAPP details regarding application testing procedures and test results, document and validate source code as well as code version, document testing acceptance criteria, and verify the results are correct. (See these documents: "EPA Manual C/0 2105-P-01-0: EPA Quality Manual for Environmental Programs" and "EPA Requirements for Quality Assurance Project Plans (QA/R-5)").  The QAPP should contain all of the sections outlined in the EPA Requirements (QA/R-5) document.  Section B headings can be edited to document software-specific quality assurance.
The contractor shall evaluate the work order and the materials provided by the EPA COR and proceed to submit the QAPP and the work plan with a financial statement within 3 weeks upon the initial communication (Task 1). Within 7 days after the approval of the work plan, the contractor shall hold another conference call with the EPA COR for the discussions on the scope of the contract and for any additional questions and clarifications. 
Deliverable 2: The contractor shall submit a work plan and QAPP within 3 weeks after the initial conference call.  			
Task 3. The contractor shall develop the enhancements to Commodity Consumption Calculator 
Currently, the Commodity Consumption Calculator contains options for selecting a food commodity/commodity code or a commodity group, age group, race, and gender.  Once these selections are made, the calculator generates two tables with percentiles. The first table presents the intake in g/day and the second table presents the intake in g/kg-day.  The calculator only allows the user to run one age group at a time.  The enhancements requested under this contract shall make the tool more user friendly and allow for more flexibility for the user. The contractor shall make the following enhancements to the tool. 1.	Allow users to select either two day average or each day consumption separately method for calculation of summary statistics for a given demographic subgroup 2.	Allow users to select multiple age groups at a time (e.g, by means of check buttons) 3.	Generate tables similar to the food intake tables in the Exposure Factors Handbook (example attached) including information about the food commodities selected, age groups, gender and any other user selected information. 4.	Include additional commodity groups, including totals for the major food groups (e.g., vegetables, fruits, meats, dairy products, grains, fats), and exposed and protected fruits and vegetables.  A list of protected and exposed foods will be provided by the EPA COR (e.g, by pre-specified check boxes that match the EFH)
Deliverable 3:	The contractor shall submit a beta version of the tool with the enhancements within 8 weeks after the receiving work plan and QAPP approval.  
Task 4.  The contractor shall incorporate comments on the beta version of the tool and produce an interim version of the tool for external review, and a final version for linking from EPA-Expo-Box
EPA will conduct an internal review of the beta version of the tool and provide comments to the contractor.  The contractor shall address the comments and produce an interim version of the tool suitable for external review. The contractor shall produce a response to comments document summarizing how internal comments were addressed.  The external review will be conducted by EPA under a separate contract. The contractor shall incorporate comments obtained from the external review and submit a final version of the tool for EPA clearance. The contractor shall address any comments that may arise from management clearance.  The contractor shall produce a response to comments document summarizing how external comments were addressed.  Once the final version of the tool has been cleared by EPA management, a link to the tool will be added to EPA-Expo-Box to allow users to access the tool.
Deliverable 4a:The contractor shall incorporate comments from the internal review, disposition of internal comments and produce another version suitable for external review within 6 weeks after the receiving comments.  
Deliverable 4b:The contractor shall incorporate comments from the external review, disposition of external review comments and produce a final version within 4 weeks after the receiving comments.

Accordingly, the VA intends to sole source this requirement to College of American Pathologists (CAP),  325 Waukegan Road, Northfield, IL. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. Currently COLLEGE OF AMERICAN PATHOLOGISTS is the only vendor on CMS's list of approved Proficiency Testing (PT) providers that provides proficiency testing materials for all specialties/subspecialties required by VHA.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires that all laboratory testing performed at VHA medical laboratories, both within medical centers or community based laboratories, utilized for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease in patients meet or exceed the requirements of 42 CFR 493. It is therefore required that all clinical laboratory testing, regardless of location, undergo regular Proficiency Testing  (PT) for regulated analytes per the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) approved proficiency testing programs.

The Contractor must be an APPROVED ACCREDITING ORGANIZATION UNDER THE CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS (CLIA) and shall provide an uninterrupted supply of Proficiency Testing for all the following specialties/subspecialties in all complexity categories for both regulated and non-regulated analytes (as determined by the individual facility's patient testing menu):  Microbiology, Bacteriology, Mycobacteriology, Mycology, Parasitology, Virology, Diagnostic Immunology, Syphillis, General Immunology, Immunoglobulins, Chemistry (routine), Blood Gases, Endocrinology, Toxicology, Hematology, Immunohematology, Histocompatibility, and Cytology.

THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification prior to the response due date and time. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the award. Responses are due by March 13, 2015 12:00PM EDT. Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to tracie.quinn@va.gov. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2<br />FAR 52.212-2, paragraph (a) is changed to read:</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a requirements type contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Only the solicitation package of responsive Offerors shall be evaluated. Award will be made <br />based on a best value approach; the Government will award to the offeror of the best value to the Government. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Price<br />Factor 2: Technical Capability<br />Factor 3: Past Performance</p>
<p>(1) Factor 1:Price. An offerors quoted prices will be determined by calculating the total price of the base and all option years.</p>
<p>Note: Extension of services option. The government will evaluate bids for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic year requirement, as described below:</p>
<p>A) Estimated total amount of all options, by area, specified in the schedule under the authority of contract clause FAR 52.217-9 "Option to Extend the Term of the Contract" will be added to the basic year (including all areas) of the requirement.</p>
<p>B) Estimated total amount of "Extended Service" options specified in the schedule under the authority of contract clause, FAR 52.217-8 "Option to Extend Services" will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The price equivalent to the six (6) months extension of services authorized by 52.217-8 will be evaluated and factored as part of the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) for award. The Government will calculate proposed prices for a quantity equivalent to six months by prorating proposed prices offered for each area, including all Option's under FAR 52.217-9, using the following formula:</p>
<p>Base Period Total Extended Amount of each Area x 0.5*<br />1st Option Period Total Extended Amount of each Area x 0.5*<br />2nd Option Period Total Extended Amount of each Area x 0.5*<br />3rd Option Period Total Extended Amount of each Area x 0.5*<br />4th Option Period Total Extended Amount of each Area x 0.5*</p>
<p>Note* 0.5 is the multiplicative factor used to derive the six months quantity value. If the period of performance is delayed, we will adjust the multiplicative factor in cases where the period of performance is less than 12 months.</p>
<p>C) Then, the total area amounts figured at paragraph 1.A will be added to the total area amounts calculated in para. 1.B to arrive at the TEP amounts for each area. Note, these TEP area amounts are for evaluation purposes only. Since the actual exercise of the Extension of Services for up to six months is a maximum period granted under FAR 52.217-8; the actual period of contract extension is unknown until the extension becomes necessary.</p>
<p>(2) Factor 2: Technical Capability. The factor will be rated as Acceptable or Unacceptable. Acceptable is defined as the quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Unacceptable is defined as the quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>(A) Proof of current Regional Storage Management Office (RSMO) certification. RSMO certification must remain current throughout the life of the contract.<br />(B) Submit with proposal the completed contract provisions; DFARS 252.203-7005, 252.209-7998, 252.209-7999. These Provisions are incorporated in Part 13 of this document.</p>
<p>(3) Factor 3: Past Performance. The Government will conduct an evaluation and review of all recent past performance data obtained to determine how closely the work performed under these efforts relates to the proposed effort and how well that work was performed. The offeror shall consider the requirements contained in FAR Clauses 52.212-1 when submitting their past performance references. Past performance shall be evaluated based on how recent, relevant and the quality of services rendered. To consider relevancy and quality the past performance evaluation will consider all aspects of an &lsquo;offerors' past performance. For purposes of this evaluation, recent is defined as contracts performed within the past three (3) years from the issuance date of the solicitation. This factor will be rated as Acceptable or Unacceptable. Acceptable is defined as the pass performance clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Unacceptable is defined as the past performance does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's experience deemed relevant to the requirements of this RFQ. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess experience.</p>
<p>(1) Submit attachment 4, Past Performance Questionnaire, from no more than five (5), of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years to SSgt Christopher Harris via email, Email: christopher.harris.20@us.af.mil, no later than solicitation closing time and date.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING FULL TEXT PROVISIONS APPLY TO THIS SOLICITATION:</p>
<p><br />52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --</p>
<p>(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and</p>
<p>(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<DESC>This solicitation, SP4708-15-R-0001, was previously synopsized on January 15, 2015 under the FBO Presolicitation Notice "SP4708-15-R-0001(Update)".&nbsp; The write-up below is for informational purposes only.&nbsp; The solicitation&nbsp;can be accessed by selecting&nbsp;and downloading the attachments to this notice.&nbsp; Prospective offerors are advised to download and review all attached materials prior to responding to this solicitation.<br /><br />DOD EMALL is an internet-based ordering service that allows customers to make a "Best Value" decision for products from a variety of sources through a single entry point based on price, delivery, product description, vendor performance, or other factors required to meet mission objectives.<br /><br />This DOD EMALL solicitation seeks to establish Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) type contracts for various commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items which will be ordered through the DOD EMALL system for delivery to DOD EMALL customers worldwide. DOD EMALL customers include DoD military and non-military customers, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) acting as or on behalf of the customer, and customers of other Government entities (including Federal, State, and/or Local). This solicitation is being issued as part of a Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program using the guidance of FAR and DFARS Subpart 8.4 for ordering procedures. (See DLAD 8.400-90 DoD electronic mall (EMALL) and FAR 38.000 Federal Supply Schedule Contracting). The DoD MAS program is designed to provide logistic support that empowers the customer to select the product that best meets their mission needs using best value ordering procedures. <br /><br />This solicitation shall remain open for period not to exceed five (5) years in total length, unless sooner replaced by an updated solicitation, with recurring opening and closing periods on a quarterly basis. <br /><br />The intention of this solicitation is to make multiple awards for the entire spectrum of categories of items required. The maximum quantity of supplies for this acquisition is set at $100 Million (M) based on the aggregated total value of all of the individual IDIQ maximums to be established for each individual contract awarded as a result of this solicitation. The guaranteed minimum dollar value that the Government agrees to order during the period of any awarded contract will be $100.00. No order against any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation shall exceed $100,000.<br /><br />This solicitation will also act as an interim solution for prospective suppliers to submit catalogs for loading to the DOD EMALL system until this system is replaced by the Next Generation e-Commerce Solution (NGe-Com), which may become a "Federal Mall", or "FedMall" (note: this effort was previously referred to as "DOD EMALL 2.0"). It is anticipated that "FedMall" will be in its Full Deployment (FD) phase of development as early as the end of the third quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Given this aggressive timeline and the overall complexity of this effort, it is anticipated that there will be an integrated concurrent approach to development and deployment.<br /><br />The scope of this solicitation is limited to a subset of the DLA Managed Federal Supply Classes (FSCs; also referred to as Product Service Codes (PSCs)) and commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items (see FAR 2.101) matching the FSC descriptions. Descriptions of the required items (and excluded items), technical requirements, and performance requirements are outlined in the solicitation's Schedule of Supplies/Services and Statement of Work.<br /><br />All ordering shall be conducted electronically. DOD EMALL is the sole means by which orders will be issued against any contract awarded in response to this solicitation. Prospective suppliers will be required to submit an Electronic Commerce ("EC") Implementation Plan with their proposals. The EC Implementation Plan shall detail the contractor's computer hardware/software, thereby outlining the contractor's capability to receive electronic orders. At a minimum, all responding offerors must address how they intend on interfacing with the DOD EMALL System and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service's (DFAS's) Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system. <br /><br />Suppliers will also create a catalog using the Microsoft Excel workbook titled "DOD EMALL Catalog Loader Template and Instructions.xlsx" (see Attachment 2). The first spreadsheet (tab) in this workbook, entitled "Data Dictionary", provides descriptions and instructions for each of the catalog loader data elements, and identifies the ten (10) mandatory data elements that must be addressed for each item when creating a new catalog or issuing a catalog change. The second spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Requirements", provides the template that suppliers shall populate when submitting their catalog. The third spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Unit of Issue Codes", provides a listing of all acceptable Unit of Issue (UOI) codes used within the DOD EMALL system, which offerors are required to identify for each item in their catalog. The vendor shall also establish "Days After Receipt of Order (ARO)" for each item in its catalog. Vendors shall honor the posted delivery times in the catalog at the time of delivery order placement. Vendors will be required to make every effort to ship urgent or high priority orders within 24 hours after receipt of order, at no additional cost to the government, and meet all Preservation, Packaging, Packing, Labeling and Marking (PPPL&amp;M) requirements. All offered pricing within Supplier Catalogs shall be Fright on Board (FOB) Destination and must be inclusive of all shipping, handling, and transportation costs. Offerors may provide pricing and delivery terms based on customer location for Contiguous United States (CONUS) delivery; Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico (AHP) delivery; and Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) delivery. The DOD EMALL will provide the shipping addresses for each order placed through the DOD EMALL system. Shipment shall be made via traceable means.<br /><br />The terms of the contracts awarded as a result of the contemplated solicitation will have a Base Period and four (4) Option Periods (for a total of five (5) periods of performance). Each of these contract periods shall be for one year, unless otherwise specified in the award document. All contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation shall not exceed 60 months (should all option periods be exercised).<br /><br />The Government intends to award contracts without discussions on the basis of initial offers; however, it reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) if it is advantageous to the Government. The proposals will be reviewed in order of receipt and priority and compared to the checklist contained within the solicitation to ensure that offerors have submitted complete proposals. The Government intends to award to any responsible offeror who can comply with the supply and technical requirements at fair and reasonable prices. No award will be made to any offeror whose pricing is not considered fair and reasonable, or is uncompetitive with existing contractors providing the same supplies. An initial assessment of all proposals submitted prior to the closing date and time will be performed within a reasonable amount of time after offers are retrieved from the Business Opportunities Office to determine completeness. <br /><br />One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

Each reference shall include: the company or agency name, address, contract or order number, point(s) of contract phone number and email address(es).  References provided may be contacted by the Government.  Their statements will be used in the evaluation of the offerors quotation.  In addition, any information obtained by the Government from references outside of the offerors quotation may also be used, in a similar manner, in the technical evaluation of the offerors quotation to the extent appropriate. Past performance information provided by references, from Government records, or from other than the sources identified by the offeror may be used in the evaluation under any or all applicable evaluation factors.

Between acceptable quotations with a significant difference in non-price merit, a determination will be made as to whether the additional non-price merit or benefits reflected by a higher priced quotation warrants payment of the additional price or cost.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS <br> W91ZLK-15-T-0082 <br> ACOUSTICAL PANELS, JPEO-CBD <br> BRAND NAME OR EQUAL <br> QUESTION 1: RECEIVED ON Thu 2/26/2015 3:15 PM <br> Are drawings available for this solicitation? <br> ANSWER 1: RECEIVED ON Thu 2/26/2015 3:36 PM <br> It's not permissible for me to send drawings via email.  They will be able to see the area/take measurements as needed during the visit.  We may be able to provide them with a hard copy during their visit. <br> QUESTION 2: RECEIVED ON Mon 3/9/2015 8:54 AM <br> Can you ask the end customer if they are flexible with having the panels be removable? My supplier wanted me to ask because he says he doesn't typically see this kind of application. Also, he says if it's for cleaning that the panels would be easier to clean if they were left on the wall. He did say that if any panels are damaged, they can easily be replaced. <br> CLARIFICAITON REQUESTED QUESTION 2: RECEIVED ON Mon 3/9/2015 2:30 PM <br> Easily replaced how is my question? <br> How much is involved in replacing them? <br> Is this something that they can teach the customer how to do? <br>  <br> CLARIFICAITON RECIEVED QUESTION 2: RECEIVED ON Mon 3/9/2015 4:24 PM <br>  quote mark I can teach the end user and include some extra material for attic stock to be used in case they had to replace any. If they are that worried about the fabric needing to be cleaned they should look at Carnegie Xorel fabrics. It sounds like the perfect application for this type of fabric which can easily be cleaned. FR701 is not a fabric that can be cleaned. The weave and material won't hold up. quote mark  <br>  <br> ANSWER 2: RECEIVED ON Tue 3/10/2015 9:27 AM <br> Government requires removable panels.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> REQUIREMENT BELOW: <br>  <br> 1.

The maximum quantity of supplies for this acquisition is set at $100 Million (M) based on the aggregated total value of all of the individual IDIQ maximums to be established for each individual contract awarded as a result of this solicitation. The guaranteed minimum dollar value that the Government agrees to order during the period of any awarded contract will be $100.00. No order against any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation shall exceed $100,000.<br /><br />This solicitation will also act as an interim solution for prospective suppliers to submit catalogs for loading to the DOD EMALL system until this system is replaced by the Next Generation e-Commerce Solution (NGe-Com), which may become a "Federal Mall", or "FedMall" (note: this effort was previously referred to as "DOD EMALL 2.0"). It is anticipated that "FedMall" will be in its Full Deployment (FD) phase of development as early as the end of the third quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Given this aggressive timeline and the overall complexity of this effort, it is anticipated that there will be an integrated concurrent approach to development and deployment.<br /><br />The scope of this solicitation is limited to a subset of the DLA Managed Federal Supply Classes (FSCs; also referred to as Product Service Codes (PSCs)) and commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items (see FAR 2.101) matching the FSC descriptions. Descriptions of the required items (and excluded items), technical requirements, and performance requirements are outlined in the solicitation's Schedule of Supplies/Services and Statement of Work.<br /><br />All ordering shall be conducted electronically. DOD EMALL is the sole means by which orders will be issued against any contract awarded in response to this solicitation. Prospective suppliers will be required to submit an Electronic Commerce ("EC") Implementation Plan with their proposals. The EC Implementation Plan shall detail the contractor's computer hardware/software, thereby outlining the contractor's capability to receive electronic orders. At a minimum, all responding offerors must address how they intend on interfacing with the DOD EMALL System and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service's (DFAS's) Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system. <br /><br />Suppliers will also create a catalog using the Microsoft Excel workbook titled "DOD EMALL Catalog Loader Template and Instructions.xlsx" (see Attachment 2). The first spreadsheet (tab) in this workbook, entitled "Data Dictionary", provides descriptions and instructions for each of the catalog loader data elements, and identifies the ten (10) mandatory data elements that must be addressed for each item when creating a new catalog or issuing a catalog change. The second spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Requirements", provides the template that suppliers shall populate when submitting their catalog. The third spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Unit of Issue Codes", provides a listing of all acceptable Unit of Issue (UOI) codes used within the DOD EMALL system, which offerors are required to identify for each item in their catalog. The vendor shall also establish "Days After Receipt of Order (ARO)" for each item in its catalog. Vendors shall honor the posted delivery times in the catalog at the time of delivery order placement. Vendors will be required to make every effort to ship urgent or high priority orders within 24 hours after receipt of order, at no additional cost to the government, and meet all Preservation, Packaging, Packing, Labeling and Marking (PPPL&amp;M) requirements. All offered pricing within Supplier Catalogs shall be Fright on Board (FOB) Destination and must be inclusive of all shipping, handling, and transportation costs. Offerors may provide pricing and delivery terms based on customer location for Contiguous United States (CONUS) delivery; Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico (AHP) delivery; and Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) delivery. The DOD EMALL will provide the shipping addresses for each order placed through the DOD EMALL system. Shipment shall be made via traceable means.<br /><br />The terms of the contracts awarded as a result of the contemplated solicitation will have a Base Period and four (4) Option Periods (for a total of five (5) periods of performance). Each of these contract periods shall be for one year, unless otherwise specified in the award document. All contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation shall not exceed 60 months (should all option periods be exercised).<br /><br />The Government intends to award contracts without discussions on the basis of initial offers; however, it reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) if it is advantageous to the Government. The proposals will be reviewed in order of receipt and priority and compared to the checklist contained within the solicitation to ensure that offerors have submitted complete proposals. The Government intends to award to any responsible offeror who can comply with the supply and technical requirements at fair and reasonable prices. No award will be made to any offeror whose pricing is not considered fair and reasonable, or is uncompetitive with existing contractors providing the same supplies. An initial assessment of all proposals submitted prior to the closing date and time will be performed within a reasonable amount of time after offers are retrieved from the Business Opportunities Office to determine completeness. <br /><br />One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to procure a preventative maintenance and emergency service agreement for the Biochemistry and Biophysics Center's (BBC) Lab of Computational Biology Computer Center's Critical Equipment in the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). <br />&emsp;<br />(v) Background:<br /><br />The mission of the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) is to perform robust scientific and clinical research leading to a better understanding of biology and clinical pathology. To attain this goal, we have built a strong basic science foundation and coupled it closely with innovative technology development and outstanding clinical research both at the NIH Clinical Center and in partnership with local hospitals.</p>
<p>The purview of our research is broad, encompassing investigations into the basic principles of molecular, cellular, and organ-level biology and their relationship to disease. Some current areas of fundamental interest include single molecule structure; protein assembly; molecular and cell biology; cell signaling and motility; membrane trafficking; physiology; systems biology; engineering and technology development. Insights into disease mechanisms derived from basic studies form the basis for translational research into new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p>DIR investigators also conduct concept-based clinical studies in the areas of interventional and surgical cardiology; pulmonary medicine; sickle cell anemia; bone marrow transplant; and hematologic disorders. Providing state-of-the-art training in basic, translational, and clinical research for the next generation of scientific and clinical leaders is a high priority. This program provides opportunities for scientists and trainees to work together towards a better understanding of molecular machines, the cell, the body, and ultimately the treatment of human diseases.</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Computational Biology (LCB) is an interdisciplinary group of scientists who study biological processes via computer simulation. The Laboratory is organized into three sections and one facility; Computational Biophysics Section, Membrane Biophysics Section (MBS), Theoretical Cellular Physics Section (TCPS), and Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Facility (BISB).</p>
<p>The laboratory requires emergency response, semi-annual service and annual service on a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply), quarterly service on associated batteries, annual service on UPS peripherals, power conditioners, and six (6) preventative maintenances&nbsp;precision cooling services to prevent research data vulnerability to loss and corruption.</p>

(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B.

<p><em>*</em>Small requirement for the first year of the BPA, but historically required an additional 660 mice per year<br />**No current requirement but previously used<br /><br /><em>Delivery Location:</em><br />AFRRI Loading Dock<br />Include PO Number on Packing Slip<br />8901 Wisconsin Avenue<br />Building 42<br />Bethesda, MD 20889-5603</p>
<p>The government intends to award multiple firm-fixed priced (FFP) BPAs to the offeror(s) representing the best value, using tradeoffs, to the government based on the evaluation factors listed below.  The Government reserves the right to add BPA holders at any time during the life of the agreement. Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance, with most important listed first.  The government will conduct a trade-off between price and non-price factors.  The Government is not required to award to the lowest priced offeror or the highest technically rated offeror.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation Factors (Listed in order of importance):<br /></span></strong><br /><strong>1.	Corporate Experience: </strong>Offerors are required to provide a narrative of their corporate experience in supplying mice and rats for research purposes.  Experience in providing the specific strains include in the estimated requirements spreadsheet may be considered more desirable by the Government.</p>
<p>Maximum Number of Pages:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 3 pages</span></p>
<p><strong>2.	Technical Experience:</strong> Offerors must submit literature for the quoted animals and provide a description of the housing for the animal and the transportation method. At a minimum, the literature must demonstrate that the animals quoted meet the minimum specifications. Offerors must also provide literature on their breeding program and how they maintain adequate levels of stock for the mice and rat strains identified. Offerors must also provide delivery lead time after receipt of order.  As part of evaluating corporate experience, USU reserves the right to visit the offerors' facilities prior to award.</p>
<p>Maximum Number of Pages:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 7 pages</span></p>
<p><strong>3.	Past Performance: </strong> The Government shall evaluate the offeror's present and past performance on similar tasks within the past three years.  Offerors must provide two (2) customer references for similar work performed.   The Government reserves the right to select which reference(s) to contact.  The following must be provided for each listed reference:<br />&bull;	Name of client and address<br />&bull;	Name of current point of contact including telephone number , email address and title<br />&bull;	Contract number<br />&bull;	Contract value<br />&bull;	Contract period of performance<br />&bull;	A clear description of the supplies/services provided</p>
<p>USU may request additional information at any time.</p>
<p>Offerors will have an opportunity to address any adverse past performance history.  Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably, but will instead receive a Neutral/Unknown rating for past performance.  Offerors must clearly state in their quote if they do not have at least two (2) past performance references.  Failure to provide this information may render an offeror's quote non-responsive and may not be considered for award.</p>
<p>A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable performance. The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternative sources in conducting its assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>Maximum Number of Pages:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> 2 pages</span></p>
<p><strong>4.	Price:  Offerors are required to complete the highlighted cells in the pricing Excel spreadsheet provided as Attachment 1.</strong> Prices will be evaluated by calculating the total cost of all five years of pricing provided in the spreadsheet.  For evaluation purposes, the cost of shipping will be evaluated using 10 deliveries per year.    Offerors must provide a fixed price unit cost and total cost for the full duration of the BPA.   Offerors are requested to include prices for other available strains of mice and rats that can be incorporated in the BPA.  Offerors must include all applicable costs (Example: Animals, Containers, Shipping) in their quote.  Prices can be reevaluated annually on the anniversary of the date of award and can be adjusted to a mutually agreeable price.  If the presented price is determined not to be fair and reasonable, the Government reserves the right to not utilize the BPA.</p>
<p>The quantities listed are estimates only and are based on the traditional five percent increase in rodent purchases.</p>
<p>See attached list for applicable provisions and clauses for this requirement.</p>

<p>If a vendor knowingly fails to follow the requirements provided in the Statement of Work or withholds critical health information concerning the vendors supply colonies that causes damage to the ordering investigator or other existing AFRRI rodent colonies, the contractor may, in place of actual damages, pay the Government liquidated damages. The value of the liquidated damages will be calculated based on the cost to purchase replacement animals from another provider, to include shipping and handling, and any grant funds lost due to the nonconforming animals.</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>
<p>Funding will be provided at the time of issuance for each call.  Department will submit a bulk fund deposit request to Financial Management prior to placing any call.</p>

<DESC>Background: The Army Contracting Command- New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey entered into a Section 845 Prototype Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) for Weapon Systems Information Technologies initiatives with the Consortium for Command, Control, Communications and Computer Technologies (C5). The Weapon Systems Information Technologies Center (WeSITC), located within the Armaments Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC) at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, was established to assist customers across the DoD and national intelligence community with rapid acquisition of innovative information-assurance, cyber and related technologies using Other Transaction Authority (OTA). These technologies are critical to maintaining U.S. military supremacy in weapon systems information technologies.  <br>    <br>  The United States Air Force (USAF) is pursuing viable technology demonstrations through the C5 Consortium to meet an Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) requirement for a capability to develop, demonstrate, implement and transition enterprise solutions to automate information redaction in support of country-specific intelligence products. Consortium participants would be expected to demonstrate technical capability to translate security guidance into business rules, apply the rules to a finished Intelligence Product, and produce a coalition releasable product for analyst and/or Foreign Disclosure Office(FDO) review.  Releaseability rules vary by country, platform, sensor, etc., and may change frequently, thus the capability must allow modification of the business rules by authorized and trained site personnel.    <br>    <br>  Membership in C5 is required in order to participate in the demonstration. For information on the C5 and/or how to become a member, visit the following website: http://c5technologies.org/   <br>    <br>  This is not a Request for Proposals or Quote, but for planning purposes only. A contract award will not be made from this announcement. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of the C5, and industry in general, advanced notification of Government intent.   <br>

<DESC>*NOTE: The Contract Specialist (Contracting Point of Contact) is the only change to this RFI. <br>  <br> Multi-modal Signal and Fusion Processor  <br>  Request for Information (RFI)  <br>  February 2015  <br>    <br>    <br>  This is a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis. This RFI is for planning purposes only. This is NOT a request for Quotations or Proposals. No solicitation document exists and formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI. The Government will not pay for any response expenses. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.   <br>    <br>  Background  <br>    <br>  Over the last decade, combat operations necessitated an overwhelming focus on short-term reactive Processing Exploitation & Dissemination (PED) with evolutionary improvements narrowly targeted at immediate capabilities. PED activities support intelligence operations by converting and refining collected information for reporting to commanders, decision makers, intelligence analysts, and other consumers. Without appreciation for broader capability alignments, integration into the PED enterprise, or Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), traditional PED methodologies represent a critical flaw in producing actionable intelligence in a timely manner. The future for combat forces, both asynchronous engagements and traditional force-on-force actions, require the capability to conduct PED information collected in the terrestrial, aerial, and space layers to generate intelligence and combat information for commanders and staff in any environment and in all phases of unified land operations (Figure 1).   <br>  The inability to adequately perform PED limits the commander's situational awareness. It impairs operational planning and execution. This hinders the capability to conduct prioritized information-collection missions. The future of effective combat operations requires a refinement in every aspect of PED, a strategic reevaluation of traditional investments, and a focus on delivering actionable intelligence in light of the exponentially increasing volume of sensor data available. Automated processing and semi-automated exploitation of collected information, with broadcast dissemination of relevant combat information and intelligence has become a critical tool in empowering the Soldier with a Common Operational Picture (COP). The ultimate goal is to process all collected information, make it accessible and discoverable through a standards-based data management framework, and reduce the processing and exploitation time between sensor and analyst.   <br>  Description  <br>    <br>  The US Army has multi-sensor platforms that are able to capture multiple sources of intelligence data for tactical operations using airborne platforms, such as the Enhanced Medium Altitude Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (EMARSS), and vehicles, such as Vigilant Pursuit.  These platforms contain sensors that collect data of different modalities, such as imagery, full motion video, audio via SIGINT, and various forms of radar data. Applying multi-modal fusion to this data could produce tips, cross-cues, filtering, object extraction, tags, fire requests, and alerts. Currently multi-modal fusion of sensor data occurs at fixed site locations. This approach introduces additional communication traffic over intermittent links along with latency. Instead, multi-modal fusion should be performed on the sensor platforms and on platforms in proximity of the recipients of the actionable intelligence and situation awareness produced by the fusion.  <br>    <br>  U.S. Army Communications-Electronic Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is conducting this RFI to determine potential capability and innovative approaches for a common architecture for performing multi-modal fusion within signal processors, on the payload of sensor platforms, on maneuvering vehicles, and at fixed site locations. This common architecture will be aligned with a Distributed Process Exploitation Dissemination (DPED) Army enterprise across echelons and adjacent units.  <br>    <br>  To this end, the Army is seeking PED applications that accelerate the processing of intelligence, increase the richness of exploitation, facilitate dissemination, expedite and enhance analyst RFI fulfillment, and improve commander situational awareness.  Applications may lend themselves to either real-time or forensic use or both.  Examples of such algorithms include (but are not limited to) the following:  <br>     <br>    <br>  Real-time algorithms will reside directly on the sensor platform, with the purpose of rapidly processing, correlating, and reducing multi-INT data for immediate situational awareness as well as maximizing available bandwidth to a ground station or PED cell.  Forensic algorithms take advantage of the wider range of data available on the cloud along with the increased processing power available to provide enhanced products with full situational and historical context.  The primary focus of this request is the enhancement of real-time user workflow.  <br>  Technologies must be mature enough to be implemented as a service-oriented application in a cloud-based framework.  <br>    <br>  Objective:  <br>    <br>  Describe new, existing, and/or enhancements of capabilities to achieve one or more of the following objectives:  <br>  1.	Platform agnostic onboard real-time cueing, cross-cueing and tipping.  <br>  2.	Pro-Active Real-time alerting.  <br>  3.	Fusion algorithms for entity detection and tracking.  <br>  4.	Open common modular system architecture for performing levels 1 - 4 fusion. A single system architecture for all operating environments, such as aerial platforms, ground platforms, vehicles, ground stations, and operating bases. The system architecture supports adding, removing, and reconfiguring modules to address the system and operational requirements of the operating environment.  <br>  5.	Multi-level security (MLS) on a single hardware platform. Fusing multiple data sources from a lower security level can result in data at a higher security level. A single multi-modal fusion node can have several fusion functions that each generates results at different security levels.  <br>  6.	Receiving and transmitting multi-modal data over multiple communication channels (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, satellite, radio and other military communication channels). Multi-modal fusion requires the ability for a single node to receive various types of data (video, audio, imagery, radar data, tracks, or text) in various forms (raw, normalized, or processed). The modalities will vary by platform. Likewise, the modalities of the data sent from the multi-modal fusion node will vary per platform.   <br>  7.	Distributed multi-modal fusion - the interconnection of multiple nodes that perform multi-modal fusion on different platforms serving different echelons. Solutions for resolving problems that arise from interconnecting multiple nodes, such as disambiguation, synchronization, bandwidth limitations, coordination, administration and communication disruptions.  <br>    <br>  The descriptions should address the following concerns.  <br>   	Size, weight, power, and cooling (SWAP-C) reduction  <br>   	Cross-domain communication  <br>   	Secured communication  <br>   	Threat protection  <br>   	Low bandwidth and disconnected communication  <br>   	Virtualization, provisioning, and orchestration  <br>   	Testing and evaluation in a virtual simulation environment  <br>   	Existing Army Enterprise Integration.   <br>    <br>    <br>  Response  <br>    <br>  We are asking industry to provide a response to this RFI that includes:  <br>   	Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for the effort per year for five years.  <br>   	Propose a commercial software licensing approach that minimizes license management costs and leverages GOTS and COTS products availability under DoD enterprise license vehicles.  <br>   	Articulate how your solution applies to the tactical enterprise at various domains and echelons.  <br>   	Describe the risk areas from a cost, schedule and technical approach with your rationale.  <br>   	Only Us Citizens may reply-No Foreign National submissions will be accepted.   <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>  Responses to this RFI are to be unclassified and received no later than 45 days after date of release. All interested parties shall respond in as clear manner as possible to each of the areas listed above. Information is preferred in soft-copy form in Microsoft Word and shall not exceed 10 pages.

<DESC>On March 10, 2015, solicitation SP4708-15-R-0001 was posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website under the FBO Combined Synopsis/Solicitation number "SP4708-15-R-0001" (<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DLA/J3/DSCP-PB/SP4708-15-R-0001/listing.html" target="_blank">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/DLA/J3/DSCP-PB/SP4708-15-R-0001/listing.html</a>).&nbsp; The draft solicitation attached to this notice should no longer be used for reference.&nbsp; Please refer to the actual solicitation.&nbsp; <br /><br />DOD EMALL is an internet-based ordering service that allows customers to make a "Best Value" decision for products from a variety of sources through a single entry point based on price, delivery, product description, vendor performance, or other factors required to meet mission objectives. <br /><br />This DOD EMALL solicitation seeks to establish Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) type contracts for various commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items which will be ordered through the DOD EMALL system for delivery to DOD EMALL customers worldwide. DOD EMALL customers include DoD military and non-military customers, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) acting as or on behalf of the customer, and customers of other Government entities (including Federal, State, and/or Local). This solicitation is being issued as part of a Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program using the guidance of FAR and DFARS Subpart 8.4 for ordering procedures. (See DLAD 8.400-90 DoD electronic mall (EMALL) and FAR 38.000 Federal Supply Schedule Contracting). The DoD MAS program is designed to provide logistic support that empowers the customer to select the product that best meets their mission needs using best value ordering procedures. <br /><br />This solicitation shall remain open for period not to exceed five (5) years in total length, unless sooner replaced by an updated solicitation, with recurring opening and closing periods on a quarterly basis. <br /><br />The intention of this solicitation is to make multiple awards for the entire spectrum of categories of items required. The maximum quantity of supplies for this acquisition is set at $100 Million (M) based on the aggregated total value of all of the individual IDIQ maximums to be established for each individual contract awarded as a result of this solicitation. The guaranteed minimum dollar value that the Government agrees to order during the period of any awarded contract will be $100.00. No order against any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation shall exceed $100,000.<br /><br />This solicitation will also act as an interim solution for prospective suppliers to submit catalogs for loading to the DOD EMALL system until this system is replaced by the Next Generation e-Commerce Solution (NGe-Com), which may become a "Federal Mall", or "FedMall" (note: this effort was previously referred to as "DOD EMALL 2.0"). It is anticipated that "FedMall" will be in its Full Deployment (FD) phase of development as early as the end of the third quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Given this aggressive timeline and the overall complexity of this effort, it is anticipated that there will be an integrated concurrent approach to development and deployment.<br /><br />The scope of this solicitation is limited to a subset of the DLA Managed Federal Supply Classes (FSCs; also referred to as Product Service Codes (PSCs)) and commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items (see FAR 2.101) matching the FSC descriptions. Descriptions of the required items (and excluded items), technical requirements, and performance requirements are outlined in the solicitation's Schedule of Supplies/Services and Statement of Work.<br /><br />All ordering shall be conducted electronically. DOD EMALL is the sole means by which orders will be issued against any contract awarded in response to this solicitation. Prospective suppliers will be required to submit an Electronic Commerce ("EC") Implementation Plan with their proposals. The EC Implementation Plan shall detail the contractor's computer hardware/software, thereby outlining the contractor's capability to receive electronic orders. At a minimum, all responding offerors must address how they intend on interfacing with the DOD EMALL System and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service's (DFAS's) Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system. <br /><br />Suppliers will also create a catalog using the Microsoft Excel workbook titled "DOD EMALL Catalog Loader Template and Instructions.xlsx" (see Attachment 2). The first spreadsheet (tab) in this workbook, entitled "Data Dictionary", provides descriptions and instructions for each of the catalog loader data elements, and identifies the ten (10) mandatory data elements that must be addressed for each item when creating a new catalog or issuing a catalog change. The second spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Requirements", provides the template that suppliers shall populate when submitting their catalog. The third spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Unit of Issue Codes", provides a listing of all acceptable Unit of Issue (UOI) codes used within the DOD EMALL system, which offerors are required to identify for each item in their catalog. The vendor shall also establish "Days After Receipt of Order (ARO)" for each item in its catalog. Vendors shall honor the posted delivery times in the catalog at the time of delivery order placement. Vendors will be required to make every effort to ship urgent or high priority orders within 24 hours after receipt of order, at no additional cost to the government, and meet all Preservation, Packaging, Packing, Labeling and Marking (PPPL&amp;M) requirements. All offered pricing within Supplier Catalogs shall be Fright on Board (FOB) Destination and must be inclusive of all shipping, handling, and transportation costs. Offerors may provide pricing and delivery terms based on customer location for Contiguous United States (CONUS) delivery; Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico (AHP) delivery; and Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) delivery. The DOD EMALL will provide the shipping addresses for each order placed through the DOD EMALL system. Shipment shall be made via traceable means.<br /><br />The terms of the contracts awarded as a result of the contemplated solicitation will have a Base Period and four (4) Option Periods (for a total of five (5) periods of performance). Each of these contract periods shall be for one year, unless otherwise specified in the award document. All contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation shall not exceed 60 months (should all option periods be exercised).<br /><br />The Government intends to award contracts without discussions on the basis of initial offers; however, it reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) if it is advantageous to the Government. The proposals will be reviewed in order of receipt and priority and compared to the checklist contained within the solicitation to ensure that offerors have submitted complete proposals. The Government intends to award to any responsible offeror who can comply with the supply and technical requirements at fair and reasonable prices. No award will be made to any offeror whose pricing is not considered fair and reasonable, or is uncompetitive with existing contractors providing the same supplies. An initial assessment of all proposals submitted prior to the closing date and time will be performed within a reasonable amount of time after offers are retrieved from the Business Opportunities Office to determine completeness. <br /><br />One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.<br /><br />One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements, and "Berry Amendment" (see DFARS 225.7002-1 as implemented by 10 U.S.C. 2533a, and clauses at DFARS 252.225-7012, 252.225-7015, and 252.225-7021).

<DESC><strong>MODIFICATION #9:</strong>
<p>The prospectus is amended as follows:</p>
<p>1. Change to Draft Contract Exhibit B (Operating Plan).</p>
<p>Section 5)(C)(1)(a-b) is deleted and replaced with the following:</p>
<p>C) USE LIMITS, GROUP SIZE, RATIOS AND RESTRICTIONS<br />(1) Mount McKinley</p>
<p>In accordance with the Denali National Park and Preserve Backcountry Management Plan (2006), the number of available permits for climbers attempting to climb Mount McKinley currently is restricted to 1,500 during the main mountaineering season (April 1 - August 1). In 2012, the Service established a climbing allocation for Mount McKinley, documented in a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) which allows, at a minimum, 25% of permits (375) to be available for guided climbers. These 375 permits are available to be issued on January 1, 16 months prior to the climbing season. Approximately one year prior to the climbing season (April 1), the Service expects to be able make additional, unused permits available for guided climbers. The following section describes how the Service expects, based on historical trends, to allocate guided climbing permits to concessioners.</p>
<p>A minimum of 61 permits per concessioner will be available each year of the contract. If historic trends continue, the Service anticipates being able to issue at least 150 permits per concessioner, per climbing season; however, the Service cannot guarantee the exact number of permits that will be available each year of the contract. Historic data on guided versus independent climbing permits is provided in the Business Opportunity for offerors information.</p>
<p>a. Allocations</p>
<p>January 1, 16 months prior to climbing season<br />As of January 1st, a total of 375 permits (including up to 71 permits which are set aside for by historic operators) are available for guided climbers. This is the minimum number of guided climbing permits that will be available each climbing season. Guided climbing permits available to be issued as of January 1 will be allocated as follows:<br />&bull; Check-ins Non-Peak Season(s): 22 permits per concessioner <br />Pre-Peak: April 1 - May 14<br />Post-Peak: June 16 - August 1<br />&bull; Check-ins Peak Season: 39 permits per concessioner<br />Peak Season: May 15 - June 15<br />&bull; The permit totals include permits for both guides and climbers.<br />&bull; The Date of Record will be used to determine if the climb is Pre-Peak, Post-Peak or Peak season.</p>
<p>b. Additional Allocations</p>
<p>Approximately April 1, 12 months prior to climbing season:<br />As of approximately April 1st, a portion of unused permits from the total pool of 1,500 will be released for concessioners to use for additional guided climbs. These permit allowances are subject to availability, as it is the intent of the Service to maintain a reasonable number of permits for independent climbers. Additional permits issued during this period will be allocated equally among the concessioners, as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Non-Peak Season(s) check-ins: up to 51 additional permits per concessioner<br />Pre-Peak: April 1 - May 14<br />Post-Peak: June 16 - August 1<br />&bull; Check-ins Peak Season: up to 39 additional permits per concessioner<br />Peak Season: May 15 - June 15 <br />&bull; The permit totals include permits for both guides and climbers.<br />&bull; The Date of Record will be used to determine if the climb is Pre-Peak, Post-Peak or Peak season.</p>
<p><br />January 1, 3 months prior to climbing season<br />&bull; Requests for additional permits will be considered.<br />&bull; The Service process for allocating additional permit requests will be provided to the concessioner by November 30 of the previous year.<br />&bull; All check-in spaces must be booked and a deposit must be on file with the concessioner prior to requesting additional check-ins. At the request of the Superintendent, written verification of booking and deposit payment will be required. <br />&bull; If available, post January 1st check-ins will only be allowed for non-peak season climbs.</p>
<p>2. Change to Business Opportunity.</p>
<p>The following text is added to the Section "Existing Concession Operation" on Page 5:</p>
<p>The following chart depicts guided and Independent Climbing activity on Mt. McKinley from 2000-2013.</p>
<p>3. Proposals Due</p>
<p>The Proposals Due date has been extended to April 10, 2015, by no later than 4:00 p.m. Alaskan Daylight Time.</p>

<DESC>Amendment to Solicitation VA248-15-R-0827.

The purpose of the following amendment is to:
Answer questions submitted by prospective vendors (see below).

CONSOLIDATED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
QUESTIONS: All questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted to the Contracting Specialist in writing via email.  Contact Christopher Brailer (christopher.brailer@va.gov) No Later Than: close of business on March 16, 2015.  No phone responses will be accepted.  See FAR 52.214-6 Explanation to Prospective Bidders for additional information.

Q:	Do we have to own a hotel or motel to provide the services for the Veterans or can we have an agreement with a hotel or motel to lease rooms in order to accommodate the requirements to provide housing for veterans in solicitation VA24815R0827?
A:	The contractor must own a hotel or motel within the radius from the Malcom Randall VAMC specified in the Statement of Work.

Q:	How often do you need the shuttle service to run?  And what hours of operation do you require? 
A:	5am until 6 pm, running every 2-3 hours.

Q:	Section B General Requirements Number 16, Fire Safety, page 12:  It states:  "Alarms shall be installed in each room, office " Are you requiring a fire alarm in the lodging room? 
A:	The proper term should be Smoke Detectors.

Q:	Page 17, first sentence of the request notes option years yet I find no other reference to option years.  Will there be options on this contract?
A:	This was an editing error. This solicitation is only for a one (1) year period. 

Q:	Can you please provide the incumbent facility and the pattern of usage of rooms please?
A:	No current incumbent. Room usage rate is an estimate based on current usage patterns.

Q:	Section B-4, Price Schedule:  VA contracts 18, we release 3 at 6 pm, then 2 more at 9 pm;  Does this mean the VA will pay for 13 rooms per night regardless of occupancy  or do we hold 18 rooms until 6 pm, release all but 2 of the unoccupied rooms then at 9 pm release them?
A:	The estimated average daily usage is 18 rooms. Contractor must guarantee access to this number. The requiring service states that, "rarely do we need rooms after 6 pm." The release of rooms at 6 pm and 9 pm is worded this way to prevent potential loss to the contractor.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE VA PAY FOR UNUSED ROOMS.

Q:	How much advance notice will we receive on the daily rooming lists? 
A:	Reservations will be made throughout the day but could be made on unscheduled and/or emergency occasions in the evenings until approximately 11pm. All reservations will normally be made by 5:30 pm Monday- Friday.

Q:	How many ADA rooms will you need?
A:	Average 2 a night but could be more.

This is not a request for proposals. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541519. FEMA intends to award this contract to Airbus DS Communications, Inc., Temecula, CA, 92590. The contract is for one-year maintenance and support to existing hardware/software that was designed and manufactured by Airbus DS Communications, Inc.
<p>FEMA Directive 262-3 dated 11-03-11 designates the ENS system as the official FEMA solution for emergency notification. No other notification systems have been authorized for FEMA use. This system is provided by Airbus DS Communication, Inc. and is known as the VESTA&reg; Communicator. Installing and uploading another product from another contractor will void the warranty with Airbus DS Communications, Inc. and possibly create interoperability issues. FEMA requires an authorized service provider of VESTA&reg; Communicator to perform these services.</p>
<p>Maintenance and support specifications required for this system include:<br />&bull; 24x7 on-site support to 3 separate locations <br />&bull; Datasync replication from primary to 2 backup systems <br />&bull; SMS\text messaging provided through the existing Airbus DS SMS gateway to include accounting, monitoring, usage report and unlimited messages <br />&bull; On-site 24x7 technical support and maintenance for Survey Module <br />&bull; On-site 24x7 technical support and maintenance for Desktop Alert <br />&bull; Inbound Bulletin Board <br />&bull; Updates to new versions of VESTA&reg; Communicator software<br />&bull; Training for VESTA&reg; Communicator application <br />&bull; Able to create or modify custom call flows<br />&bull; Able to create or modify Pager services with the VESTA&reg; Communicator application <br />&bull; 24x7 on-site support for Custom Report module <br />&bull; 10 separate DHS agencies are supported</p>
<p>The contractor must possess an active TS Facility clearance and be able to provide personnel with active TS clearances. The contractor shall not modify any current VESTA&reg; Communicator or FEMA configuration settings external or internal to the existing systems including passwords and user accounts. <br /><br />FEMA is aware of no other firm, other than Airbus DS Communications, Inc. that can provide the type of services and software maintenance described here. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government, and information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining if other potential sources for these services exist. FEMA will not be responsible for paying for any of the costs incurred or associated with the development of any responses submitted to this posting. However, any firm that believes it is capable of providing these services, and is an authorized service provider of VESTA&reg; Communicator, shall e-mail a Statement of Capabilities to Christine Todd at Christine.Todd@fema.dhs.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Diplomatic Security Training Center requires additional parking, outside of its current site. DS requires these extra 45 parking spaces as over flow parking for when there are training classes scheduled. This parking lot should be within a quarter of a mile from the DS training center, and have 45 parking spaces during weekday business hours. These parking spaces will lessen the burden of an already crowded parking lot on site, and offer easy access for students to be able to park and walk to their classes. The New Song Church property is the only parking solution that can meet DSTC needs at this present time.

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), located in the Neal Smith Federal Building, is consolidating its offices. Currently, the DEA offices are located on the ninth and fifth floors of the building. This project will consolidate the DEA offices onto the fifth floor. Essentially, the existing DEA space and its new, adjacent, space will become one. Therefore, the current access control system, intrusion detection system, and video surveillance system will be extended into the new space. This extension of systems requires that the Government utilize the same manufacturers for the access control, intrusion detection, and video surveillance. Substance, LLC, the Architect/Engineer of record, determined that utilizing the identical manufacturers is the only way by which all of the systems will be able to operate as required.
