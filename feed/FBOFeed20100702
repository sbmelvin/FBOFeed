<DESC><br />OCCUPATIONAL MEDICAL CLINIC ACQUISITION SYNOPSIS<br />This synopsis serves as a presolicitation notification of the government's intent to issue an RFP and ultimately award a fixed price contract to provide the services summarized herein. This notification will be publicized for 15 days and any subsequent RFP is anticipated to be issued soon thereafter. <br />
<p><br />A. Description of Requirement/Statement of Need: A fully operational Occupational Medicine Clinic at Hill AFB UT, building 249. The clinic will facilitate all services for the civilian population as well as treatment of active duty as deemed necessary. The projection is based on a 23 person clinic consisting of 3 physicians, 1 physician's assistant, 5 nurses, 5 medical assistants, 7 medical records clerks, 1 administrative assistant, and 1 respiratory fit test technician. An Air Force Civilian Occupational Medicine Physician serves and will continue to serve as the Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP). The QAP will have oversight of the clinic to ensure proper performance as directed from HQ AFMC/SGA. A Statement of Work (SOW) that fully outlines job descriptions and qualifications necessary for each position within the clinic will be utilized.</p>
<p>B. Government-Furnished Property/Information: The contractor will be allowed use of building 249, Jensen Occupational Clinic, to conduct daily operations. Equipment, including crash carts, medical supplies, immunizations and other materials to maintain the clinic will be provided. Maintenance of the equipment remains with the 75th Medical Group.</p>
<p>C. Delivery or Performance Period: The contractor must be able to begin performance 1 October, 2010. The basic period of performance is 1 October 2010 - 30 September 2011.

<p>D. Market Research Results/Interested Sources: Small business goals/targets were addressed in making the decision for full and open competition. It is determined as the best practice of the government to solicit offers from all available sources. Small businesses shall be considered and may be determined as the best value; however, no preference or evaluation adjustment will be made on their behalf, nor will the solicitation/contract be set aside for small business concerns. <br />Extensive research into past performance will be conducted through submittals from the offered contractors, questionnaires from previous customers of the offered contractors, and telecom interviews made by the past performance team during the evaluation process as necessary. The ability and plan to hire proper personnel will also be evaluated as a technical factor under a compensation plan</p>

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Livestock and Seed Program intends to procure meat testing services for the meat procured for the National School Lunch Program and other Federal food and nutrition assistance programs. The proposed Meat Testing requirement will be for a one period with four option years. Geographical location(s) of the testing laboratories is undetermined as of this time. The Government is flexible as to laboratory locations as long as they can meet timeliness requirements of sample testing of AMS meat suppliers who are located in various locations across the United States.
<p>The contractor(s) will provide required meat testing for microbiological and fat tests, analysis of data and reporting of results for AMS-contracted boneless beef suppliers, suppliers of boneless beef destined for AMS-contracted ground beef, ground beef suppliers, other AMS-contracted meat product suppliers, and non-AMS contract suppliers participating in AMS' Product Certification Service.</p>
<p>The following are the tests that will be required:</p>
<p>A. Microbiogical Testing<br />Testing for all microbes as specified within the applicable AMS Federal Purchase Program Specifications. Tests will be done for both presence and quantification level microbes. Testing for quantification levels of the following will be required: <br />1. Aerobic (standard) plate counts<br />2. Total Coliforms<br />3. Generic Escherichia coli (E. coli), and <br />4. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)<br />The following Presence only tests will be required:<br />5. Salmonella, and<br />6. Shiga-toxigenic E. coli 0157 (including 0157:H7 and 0157:Non-Motile (NM)</p>
<p>B. Fat Testing Requirements<br />Samples will be tested for fat content as specified within the applicable AMS Federal Purchase Program specifications</p>
<p>Contractor(s) shall responsible for providing the sampling procedures to all meat suppliers, conducting the required tests for microbiogical and fat tests, and reporting the test results on a timely basis simultaneously to AMS and the meat supplier. All testing laboratories to be used by the contractor(s) must meet the following accreditation standards:<br />Documentation that the laboratory and methods used by the laboratory to perform testing for AMS Federal Purchase Program requirements are assessed for compliance with the quality system requirements of ISO/IEC 17025, General Requirements for the Competence of Calibration and Testing Laboratories, assessed for technical competency to perform specific tests (including proficiency testing), and accredited by the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA). Laboratories shall stay current with their A2LA laboratory (ISO/IEC 17025) accreditation and shall provide the AMS Contracting Officer with up-to-date documentation (Certificate of Accreditation and Scope of Accreditation) of their A2LA laboratory (ISO/IEC 17025) accreditation. <br /><br />The USDA intends to award multiple fixed price IDIQ (indefinite delivery indefinite quantity) commercial contracts for this effort. The contract(s) will include a one-year base period with four one-year unilateral option periods. <br />This will be a best value procurement.

<a href="mailto:glen.johnson@va.gov">P.O.C.</a>
<DESC>The Louis Stokes Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center located at 10701 East Blvd, Cleveland, Ohio 44106 intends to solicit proposal from contractors in the metropolitan Cleveland, Ohio area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about July 1, 2010, with a closing date for proposals on or about July 23, 2010.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals. The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 2-week period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about August 1, 2010.  Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for four additional one-year terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA.   

The government will use a best value source selection method under Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and anticipates making multiple awards of fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts for this requirement.

NAICS Code is 624229 and the solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration data base at www.ccr.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit that CCR website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided. No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>As part of the CDUM Research and Development initiative, DSCP purchased and installed a 3D Body Scanner machine at Lackland AFB to measure recruits for proper sizing and to record such data for future forecasting. This initiative has been useful in determining proper sizing and has assisted in stock positioning. At the conclusion of the R&amp;D effort, C&amp;T gave the body scanner machine to Lackland AFB which was being utilized by military personnel until several years ago. At this point in time, C&amp;T wants to reuse the 3D Body Scanner for stock repositioning and forecasting purposes. However, in order to continue to use this equipment the machine needs to be inspected, software update, calibrated and maintained on a yearly basis.
<p>The 3D Body Scanner requires specialized software and technologies that were designed and installed by Human Solutions of North America; therefore, making the 3D Body Scanner proprietary. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Human Solutions is the only known capable source of responding to the specialized nature of the 3D Body Scanner, providing the necessary support to successfully inspect, calibrate and more importantly update the software needed to get the 3D Body Scanner running again. There are no substitutes for this requirement and Human Solutions is the only firm with the known capability to assist in the software update and maintenance.<br /><br />Anticipated award shall result in a firm fixed price order with a 1 year base period and 2, one (1) year option periods.</p>

<SUBJECT>99--Vehicle Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)- Draft Specification and Advisory Circular
<SOLNBR>9690
<RESPDATE>072310
<ARCHDATE>08072010
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676

<a href="mailto:steve.manley@faa.gov">steve.manley@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this public announcement is to provide industry the opportunity to review and comment on a proposed Vehicle Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Specification.
The FAA Surveillance and Broadcast Program Office is currently deploying an ADS-B system as part of FAA's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  The system will provide more precise aircraft positional information for Air Traffic Control as well as weather and other aircraft positional information to the aircraft cockpit.  Information regarding ADS-B may be found at http://www.ADS-B.Gov.  
It has been recognized that the airport surface presents specific challenges in that surface vehicles such as airport maintenance and fire trucks as well as other seasonal vehicles such as airfield snow plows pose a safety risk on the airport movement area.  FAA has determined that in order to accrue the maximum efficiency and safety benefits of ADS-B on the airport surface, surface vehicles, aside from aircraft, should be equipped with the ability to transmit ADS-B messages which can be displayed on traffic displays for both air traffic control and aircraft operators who choose to equip with the ability to receive ADS-B information.  
In response to this challenge, several vendors have developed prototype vehicle transponders which have been purchased by airport authorities in order to provide additional surface positional information.  These transponders were also used in support of ASDE-X and ADS-B test activities.  
The broadcasts from the vehicle transponders are received by planes in the area which makes the accuracy of the transmissions of paramount importance.  The current vehicle transponders do not meet critical performance requirements such as accuracy and integrity in order to be displayed on aircraft cockpit displays.  If these transponders were to malfunction and transmit incorrect information, there could be potentially serious consequences.  In addition, the interface requirements between the aircraft avionics and the vehicles were not mature.  
Accordingly, the FAA has developed the attached draft Vehicle ADS-B specification and accompanying Advisory Circular which establishes the requirements vendors must adhere to in the manufacture of vehicle transponders.   
A transponder test plan is being developed which will incorporate the following processes and will also be incorporated into the specification:  
1.	Testing will be performed at the vendor's facility in accordance with a specification test plan to verify that the functional and performance requirements of the units are met.
2.	Prior to approval of the vendor tests, a unit will be made available to eh FAA Technical Center for testing equivalent to a "first article test".  The unit will also be tested at a specified test facility that verifies the operation at an airport. 
3.	Vendor Site Acceptance Testing will be at each airport implementing vehicle ADS-B units to validate that the vehicle ADS-B squitter units are installed properly, updated maps are in all equipment units, all movement area boundaries are correct, ICAO codes are properly entered, and that the units operate properly. 
4.	The assigned FAA Quality Reliability Officer will make the final decision if the unit has passed Site Acceptance Testing and can be fully operational.  
Once the unit is found compliant, the vendor will be placed on an authorized vendor list from which airport authorities may purchase the approved units.  The FAA will not purchase any units for airport use.  An FAA Advisory Circular is also being developed which will provide more detail regarding this process.  
The owner of the units will be responsible operation and maintenance of the units.  The FAA will monitor the unit's performance for anomalies through the FAA Surveillance and Broadcast Services Compliance Monitor System.  Air Traffic Control and pilots will also be viewing the vehicle reports and will report any discrepancies to FAA Tech Ops who will in turn notify the assigned FAA QRO.   
The FAA Surveillance and Broadcast Services Office requests industry comment be   provided to FAA no later than July 30, 2010.   
Comments should be submitted to the following address:

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 6, Lakewood, Colorado intends to award a non-competitive, sole source IDIQ Contract to Milliken Meats, Ltd for Toronto Carivore Diet for endangered black footed ferrets at the Black Footed  Ferret Facility, Carr, Colorado.  The requirement will be awarded as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  Early diets were patterned after mink farm programs and were problematic in availability of diet element components, preparation, labor, storage, and overall animal benefits (e.g. rabbit bone parts periodically caused clinical complications and death).  The American Zoo and Aquarium Association's, Black-footed Ferret Species Survival Plan (SSP) worked through several zoo nutritional specialists to examine possible diet alternatives; and with development of the Toronto Carnivore Diet undertook, both nutritional analyses specifically for ferrets and clinical comparisons of animal condition following feeding trials of multiple diets.  The Toronto Carnivore Diet was found to be superior for black-footed ferrets and is the recommended principal artificial diet for the species.  The Service concurs with the position of the SSP advisory group and has found that this diet results in better overall animal health, is easy to secure and store, and reduces labor and overall staff costs.  Contracting Officer:  Cathleen DeBerry, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 6, Denver, CO 303-236-4324.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the wastewater collection system for the Truax Field Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at the Dane County Regional Airport (IAP), to the City of Madison.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. The City (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: Truax Field is located at the Dane County Regional Airport, just on the northeast side of Madison, WI.  Truax Field is approximately 130 acres in size and has 59 buildings with a square foot total of approximately 750,000. The weekday workforce is approximately 350 persons and increases to about 1000 persons on a Unit Training Assembly weekend. The wastewater collection system consists of approximately 5100 linear feet of PVC pipe, 2700 linear feet of transite pipe; and 7400 linear feet of vitrified clay pipe, without tracer wire or warning tape and pipe diameters range in size from two to ten inches. There are 26 brick manholes ranging in depth from four to ten feet, 11 pre-cast manholes ranging in depth from four to six feet, five wastewater pumps from one to five horsepower and five lift stations. Truaxs wastewater collection system was originally installed in 1942.  It contains two lift stations and one 3-inch forced main at lift station #2.  Age of the system components ranges from 1942 to present, with (approximately) 35% being over 50 years old. The system consists of approximately 7700 linear feet of active piping ranging between 3 to 8 inches. The types of pipe include PVC, vitrified clay, concrete, and cast iron.  There are 30 manholes, the majority of which are pre-cast concrete and the remaining are brick. The two lift stations are in-ground packages installed in 1982 and 1994 with automatic controls incorporating audible/visual local alarms. There are three pumps; two are 3-hp and the other is 2-hp with rated flows of 175 gpm and 50 gpm respectively.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2000. No offers were received. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution systems, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested sources shall contact Katherine Pinnow, Katherine.pinnow@ang.af.mil, 608-245-4548.

<DESC>Title: PS-OC Bioresource Core Facility (PBCF)
<p>Pre-solicitation Notice</p>
<p><br />General Information:</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) on a sole source basis for a five (5) year period (inclusive of options). This is a new requirement.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to provide a central bioresource core facility to all members of the PS-OC Network. This PS-OC Bioresource Core Facility (PBCF) shall serve as a biorepository and a distributor of biospecimens to the PS-OC Network investigators. This contract shall supply cancer cell lines, primary cells, DNA, RNA and protein isolates from such cells and reagents needed for the propagation of the cell lines. The PC-OC Network is in need of a consistent and reliable supply of well characterized cancer cells that will be distributed on an ongoing basis to 25 to 50 laboratories throughout the United States. While breast, colorectal, glioma and leukemia will initially be investigated, additional cancers will be of interest and thus a large number of different cell lines will be required. The NCI's requirement can only be met by American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); they possess unique capabilities, expertise and a sizeable network. ATCC is recognized as a world leader with a history in standard biological reference materials management and the common source in scientific community for cell line stocks, with a large cell collection, well established internal procedures and well organized global distribution mechanisms. ATCC has an in-house cell culture collection that encompasses in excess of 3,600 normal cell lines and 950 cancer cell lines, which include but not limited to breast, colorectal, leukemia, glioma, liver, pancreas, prostate, ovary, lung, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. With their in-house collection capacity, ATCC will have the ability to supply the required materials to the PS-OC investigators in an expeditious manner. ATCC has the bioresource materials in-house as well as the internal structure for storage and distribution of the materials to investigators. Based on the size and capacity of ATCC's cell collection, as well as their successful track record with cell distribution, ATCC is the only known organization that can fulfill this requirement without expending substantial costs/efforts that would be required in establishing or acquiring a network of normal and cancer cell lines of this magnitude. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document exists.

<DESC>Synopsis:<BR><BR>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) <BR>has a requirement for the recompete of  Synthetic Environment Core Common Virtual Environment Management (SE Core CVE Management). This is to announce PEO STRIs intent to award a single source award Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract which will also include other type CLINs.  The estimated value of this award is approximately $222M, with a period of performance of 12 months base plus four 12 month options for a total of 5 years. <BR><BR>SE Core enables an interoperable CVE for simulation and training programs.  SE Core focuses on delivering software and limited hardware to enable a CVE for Warfighters to train for full spectrum operations, as opposed to fielding large quantities of hardware.  The objective of SE Core is to facilitate a virtual training environment supporting mission focused unit training that approximates the changing contemporary operational environment. <BR><BR>Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), Army Training Strategies, Army Modernization Programs, Joint/Army Training Doctrine, Joint/Army Battle Command Training Support, and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) require a fully integrated LVC Training Environment (TE).  The SE Core program is the Armys virtual component of the LVC TE.  SE Core will develop and sustain the Armys CVE which links current and future virtual simulation devices into an interoperable full spectrum training capability. The CVE will connect to gaming training enablers and the live and constructive environments for an integrated LVC TE capability.  <BR><BR>SE Core is comprised of complementary efforts for developing the CVE that facilitates fair fight interoperability for virtual system and non-system Training Aids Devices Simulators and Simulations (TADSS).  The program develops operational training terrain databases, models, and simulation architecture connectivity to meet Warfighter operational training requirements.  The terrain and model development efforts provide non-proprietary, open format, and image generator independent CVE deliverables.  The simulation architecture provides an integrated training network.  These efforts, linking current and future virtual training devices/simulations, enables the Army to execute combined arms and joint training, as well as mission planning and rehearsals at home station and at deployed locations. <BR><BR>Since SE Cores system development and demonstration phase, requirements for training and SE Core have grown. SE Core will continue to produce terrain databases, common moving models, the virtual simulation architecture, changes to OneSAF, and common virtual components such as but not limited to After Action Review, Interoperability Gateway, Scenario Generation Tool, and C4I Adapter.  New requirements include but are not limited to: CVE capability management for system and non-system TADSS, mission planning and rehearsal visualization capability, acquisition of terrain source data, development of database centers, SE Core to TADSS plug-in expansion, sound and smell representation, influencing semi-automated forces enhancements and integration, exercise preparation and execution capabilities and definitions for the terms interoperability and fair fight.  It is anticipated that the SE Core CVE Management competition will be conducted on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis with best-value tradeoff evaluation procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 541512.  The small business size standard is $25M (this is only applicable to small business Offerors who wish to participate in this full and open competition).  The Government anticipates that the SE Core CVE Management solicitation will result in a five year single-award ID/IQ contract. <BR><BR>The historical contracts which are still ongoing are as follows:<BR><BR>	N61339-00-D-0710, Delivery Order 0039  SAIC<BR>        N61339-01-D-0725, Delivery Order 0006  CAE USA<BR><BR>PLEASE NOTE THE RESPONSE DATE LISTED ON THIS DOCUMENT IS ONLY USED FOR REMOVAL OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER THE REQUIRED PERIOD.  PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT ANY RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.<BR><BR>Draft RFP:<BR><BR>The draft RFP W900KK-10-R-0004 will be posted today in Fedbizopps under the Special Notice section.  The Government will not, under any circumstances, pay for Bid and Proposal (B&P) costs for Offerors who choose to prepare proposals in response to issuance of an RFP.<BR><BR>Points of Contact:<BR>Laura Parsons, Contract Specialist - 407-380-8036<BR>Lauren Bushika, Contract Specialist - 407-208-3343<BR>Milton Washington, Contracting Officer  407-381-8854<BR>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br /><br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br /><br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br /><br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Furthermore, the BBG's Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB), which broadcasts radio and television programming in Spanish to Cuba, is seeking qualified sources for similar free-lance assignments on the same "as-needed" contract basis as VOA, but with OCB's free-lance work assignment locations being Miami, FL or at overseas locations. <br /><br />The following general information pertains to all of the above-listed VOA and OCB free-lance assignments: 1) Assignments are performed on a contract basis. 2) Most VOA assignments require working in Washington, DC; while some assignments require working at IBB studios at overseas locations.

Some broadcasting activities require working irregular hours - such as very early in the morning or late in the evening - depending on the broadcasting schedule. 5) Videotape editor candidates should have at least two (2) years experience as a videotape editor in either a commercial or Government television production facility, utilizing modern computerized editing systems and videotape machines. 6) Free-lance assignments are contracted for strictly on an "as needed" basis. The VOA and OCB make no guarantees on the amount of work assignments that contractors can expect to receive. 7) The Government is obligated to inspect all contractors performed work to insure that it fully satisfies the Government's requirements. The Government is further obligated to reject all work that fails to meet Government-specified requirements. <br /><br />Contractors should note that all work shall be performed in accordance with the standards prescribed in the attached "VOA Journalistic Code". Failure to comply with these legally mandated standards may result in immediate termination of the contract for default.</p>
<p>The following criteria, depending on the type of broadcasting services being contracted, are used as appropriate by VOA and OCB to evaluate prospective contractors: (1) Radio or television broadcast or Internet news experience, including translating and adapting broadcast scripts. Please specifically note that for broadcasting work, the VOA requires that prospective contractors take a voice and writing test.

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a need for a project entitled, "Longitudinal Studies for Age-Associated Conditions in a Sardinia Population Cohort (Sardinia3). The Sardinia3 project is a continued need of the SardiNIA study under Contract No. N01AG12109 and will carry out fourth visits for the maximum number of participants that are possibly available for study. The primary study AIMS include: AIM I: Performance of all data collection activities; AIM II: Performance of data entry, verification, editing, transmittal and file management; and AIM III: The Contractor shall participate in the preparation of publications and public presentations on the results of the study, and design the studies to maintain the possibility of any future extension of the project to additional phenotypes and longitudinal studies.</p>
<p>In keeping with its overall mission, it is incumbent on the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to discriminate epidemiological and genetic factors involved in the etiology of aging-associated deficits, in order to understand and intervene to prevent or alleviate them. An indispensable and major step forward has been the progressive development of phenotypic tests for conditions and their application to determining statistical ranges of phenotypes in "outbred" (that is, genetically relatively heterogeneous populations with considerable admixtures from outside populations added over time), to assess both comparable statistical factors and epidemiological and genetic factors in the especially favorable Sardinian population.</p>
<p>Reports from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) and other population studies have identified some epidemiological and genetic risk factors for aging-associated diseases; but the majority of studies have been observational, determining the range of values for a phenotype as a function of aging. Examining the genetics of aging-associated conditions such as cardiovascular problems and osteoporosis is especially difficult because 1) they are "late-onset" conditions, affecting older individuals; and 2) they are "complex traits", with a number of genes contributing more or less to tipping the balance toward a phenotype or disease in one or another subgroup of an outbred population. Thus, traditional family genetic studies are difficult, and studies of association or linkage tend to be confounded.</p>
<p>As one aid to analyses of factors affecting aging-associated conditions and diseases, attention has increasingly focused on the promise of "founder populations" for the simplification of complex trait analysis. Such rare populations arise from a delimited group living in a defined region - in this case, the island of Sardinia - for many centuries with minimal admixture from outside populations. The high degree of relatedness in such a population helps in modern non-parametric analyses o localize and refine the localization of those genes. The Sardinian population is one of the few that is both numerous and accessible enough, and one of the most extreme in its relative homogeneity. It can thus be studied for a wide variety of both frequent and relatively rare traits. The attractiveness of Sardinia for study is increased by the concentration on a targeted region for the studies, Ogliastra, which has a particularly isolated population of 60,000, in an area enclosed by two mountain ranges and the sea.</p>
<p>The program examines phenotypes for which NIA expertise and test instruments are well developed, and which represent important aging-related conditions. The study has been scoring &gt;200 dichotomized traits (smoking, etc.) and over 100 quantitative traits ("endophenotypes" or "quantitative risk-related genetic or environmental factors") that can be scored on a continuous scale. The use of quantitative traits permits the study of the entire range of allelic variation in a population. The traits of particular interest include a range of cardiovascular risk factors, anthropometric measurements, blood test values, and facets of personality. <br /><br />Recruitment was completed for over 6,100 subjects from a selected group of four towns in east-central Sardinia where the traits for each subject was measured. Genotyping of all participants was also completed that has provided the data for investigators to look for genetic factors associated with each trait. The infrastructure for the clinic and phenotypic testing has been stable, with stringent quality control, and the data are of correspondingly high quality.</p>
<p>The sample cohort numbers over half of the population of the region aged 14-102; they are native-born, and at least 96 percent are known to have all grandparents born in the same province. The group include 4,933 phenotyped sib pairs, 4,266 phenotyped parent-child pairs, &gt;4,069 phenotyped cousin pairs, and &gt;6,459 phenotyped avuncular pairs. This sample is large enough and well enough phenotyped to show that even in this founder population, the variance for individual traits is comparable to that in outbred populations; and it is large enough and interrelated enough to infer highly significant estimates of genetic heritability for traits. With this cohort, full-genome scans with batteries of single-nucleotide markers were carried out, along with second visits to the testing center for repeated tests and additional tests related to bone-density and frailty; and third visits will be done within the tenure of the out-years of SardiNIA2, aiming at longitudinal data to supplement the cross-sectional data provided by first visits. <br /><br />A critical step in longitudinal studies would record data from a fourth visit of participants (Aim I); and transfer of the data (Aim II) would provide them for later use in a range of studies, A subsidiary Aim III would be to design the studies to maintain the option to study additional phenotypes. The study is designed to permit the estimation of individual trajectories of quantitative traits, which requires the measure of at least three points in time to avoid the bias resulting from "regression to the mean". A further advantage is that, by collecting multiple measurements over time, one can improve the power of mapping studies. Specifically, by modeling the repeated measures of each trait, one can focus on the long-term component of the trait for each individual.</p>
<p>Based on the proposed studies, the information recovered could facilitate ulterior analyses of age-related trends and the molecular nature of gene variations that are significant factors for traits of particular interest; and a platform for the possible extension of studies to other phenotypes and further longitudinal studies.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The Contractor shall extend the studies of aging-associated conditions in the especially favorable Sardinian population with longitudinal assays of traits, in order to sustain the later analysis of genetic factors involved in trait values and/or rates of change of values of a trait, and to move toward the identification of alleles that confer significant risk for extreme values of individual traits of interest in health and disease.</p>
<p>The specific Objective is to extend the longitudinal study of trends in quantitative trait values with a fourth clinic visit for the participants in the study. The Contractor shall be responsible for coordination of the data collection, including recruitment and scheduling of study participants, administration and scoring of tests for each trait and data entry and transfer. The Contractor shall provide maintenance of equipment; provide personnel, supervising their performance in the administration and scoring of the tests; and be responsible for computer entry and data transfer of the test data to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative.</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor shall be responsible for properly protecting all information used, gathered, or developed as a result of the Statement of Work (SOW). The Contractor shall establish and implement appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of sensitive Government information, data, and/or equipment.<br /><br />There are three goals for the proposed efforts to satisfy the Objective fully, consonant with the three AIMS: 1) Determine values for the specified range of phenotypes, including specified new traits, in the established cohort from the founder population of Sardinia, completing a fourth visit for the maximum of the 6,000+ initial recruits possibly available for the Tasks in SOW; 2) Provide the data (values) for all traits in electronic form and reports as specified, in order to support derived analyses and publications; and 3) Design the studies to maintain the option for later expansion of successful efforts to additional phenotypes and outcome studies in the founder population.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>A. Recruitment of Subjects and Staff, the Contractor shall develop a route to the projected goals for recruitment of subjects, including males and females from the established cohort of 6,000+ individuals; and the staff plan for the efforts, including staff recruitment and the identification of personnel to be trained in sonography and testing before studies of subjects are initiated. Phone contact shall facilitate scheduling; and as in the initial visits, the first subjects contacted for recruitment shall be those who have been identified as index cases with cardiovascular conditions, referred by their physicians, that warrant targeted investigation. These would be followed by relatives and controls from the rest of the cohort. B. Contacting and Scheduling Participants, the Contractor shall develop an Informed Consent form in Italian for the studies and receive prior written approval by the COTR prior to submission to Institutional Review Boards. The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining appropriate institutional review board approvals from local authorities, and for abiding by institutional review board rulings from NIA. The Contractor shall identify, recruit, and obtain informed consent for eligible volunteers. Participant recruitment shall be conducted so as to ensure a wide distribution of ages of participants, aiming at as much of the original subject cohort as possible. The Contractor shall be responsible for scheduling participants at the participating site(s). C. Tasks and phasing, TASK 1: Anthropometric measures and arterial stiffness and echographic assessments, the Contractor shall collect data using reliable anthropometric measures, non-invasive indices of arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity; PWV, Augmentation index; AGI), a non-invasive measure for arterial intimal-medial thickness (carotid intimal-medial thickness; IMT), and non-invasive measures of renal and thyroid ultrasound shall be performed by a trained test administrator. The cardiovascular-related measurements shall include blood pressure, heart rate, weight, height, waist to hip ratio, ankle brachial pressure index, carotid and heart bruits, as well as carotid intima-media thickness, carotid pressure-strain elastic modulus, and pulse wave velocity. At the time of testing, blood and urine samples shall be collected. A report shall be provided to each participant on selected phenotypes and related data. The report shall include data from Task 1 for which there are accepted public health practices and interventions and which are clinically well-known to the physicians, i.e. cholesterol, blood pressure, general physical parameters, etc. For the arterial stiffness measurements, the report shall indicate extreme values from carotid ultrasound that would correspond to clinical guidelines for interventions, and correspondingly extreme features from renal and thyroid ultrasound that indicate possible pathology that can be further investigated with their physician. For ankle brachial pressure index, augmentation index, echocardiogram, 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, and pulse-wave velocity. The NIA will provide standardized tests that shall be used and administered according to the standardized set of instructions in manuals provided in English by the NIA, including standardized tests for augmentation index, echocardiogram, 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, ankle brachial pressure index, renal ultrasound, and thyroid ultrasound. The COTR shall work closely with the Contractor to monitor training and testing sessions of testers, to maintain consistency both during the study and with other NIA studies. The Contractor shall report to the COTR on a monthly basis by telephone or email to review subject participation and any procedural difficulties. TASK 2: Assessments of frailty and cognitive state, 1) A lower leg PQCT scan to determine trabecular and total bone density; mechanical resistance to compression; cortical bone area and density; and muscle cross-sectional area; 2) Muscle strength testing by hand-grip strength; 3) Walking speed in a 4-meter test; 4) Self-report of exhaustion and unintentional weight loss, and level of physical activity. The Contractor shall incorporate the standard EPIC food frequency questionnaire to be completed by participants at home, or administered by an interviewer during a follow-up visit for those who experience difficulty in filling out the questionnaire; 5) Brief standard cognitive performance assessment, comprising mini-mental status examination, clocks test, fluency test, and short-term memory drawing test; and 6) The contractor shall incorporate in the third visits the standard CESD (Center for Epidemiological Study of Depression) assessment of symptoms of depression to facilitate association with frailty. TASK 3: Demographic and Short Symptom Checklist (SSCL) data, Two additional test instruments, supplied by NIA in an Italian version, shall be administered to the same population cohorts screened for arterial stiffness and personality phenotypes. One instrument is a short symptom checklist for various conditions (SSCL) and the other obtains basic demographic and family structure and composition information. The tests shall be administered with the supervision of a trained test administrator/ interviewer. TASK 4: Retinal, hearing, and facial morphology assessments, The Contractor shall collect data using reliable measures of retinal features, facial and ear morphology features, and hearing. For each subject, results shall be recorded for retinal 45 degree field photographs with a non-mydriatic retinal camera, a single photograph for each eye; for 10 photographs of frontal and 10 of side views of the head, and of hearing scored with best current practice for audiometry; TASK 5: Urine analysis and blood drawing, fractionation, sample storage, and assays, From each participant at each visit the following biological material shall be collected: 1) 10 ml of fasting morning (middle catch) urine shall be collected and stored at -80&deg; in ten(10) 1-mL aliquots, and 2) 50 ml of blood from overnight-fasting subjects shall be drawn and fractionated to provide at least: (a) from 40 mL, fourteen (14) 1-ml aliquots of EDTA-plasma and eight (8) 1-mL aliquots of heparin-plasma, four (4) full buffy coats, and two (2) samples of red blood cells; (b) from 10 ml of blood, about 640 ug of total DNA extracted in two (2) separate aliquots.

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a need for a project entitled, "Longitudinal Studies for Age-Associated Conditions in a Sardinia Population Cohort (Sardinia3). The Sardinia3 project is a continued need of the SardiNIA study under Contract No. N01AG12109 and will carry out fourth visits for the maximum number of participants that are possibly available for study. The primary study AIMS include: AIM I: Performance of all data collection activities; AIM II: Performance of data entry, verification, editing, transmittal and file management; and AIM III: The Contractor shall participate in the preparation of publications and public presentations on the results of the study, and design the studies to maintain the possibility of any future extension of the project to additional phenotypes and longitudinal studies.</p>
<p>In keeping with its overall mission, it is incumbent on the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to discriminate epidemiological and genetic factors involved in the etiology of aging-associated deficits, in order to understand and intervene to prevent or alleviate them. An indispensable and major step forward has been the progressive development of phenotypic tests for conditions and their application to determining statistical ranges of phenotypes in "outbred" (that is, genetically relatively heterogeneous populations with considerable admixtures from outside populations added over time), to assess both comparable statistical factors and epidemiological and genetic factors in the especially favorable Sardinian population.</p>
<p>Reports from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) and other population studies have identified some epidemiological and genetic risk factors for aging-associated diseases; but the majority of studies have been observational, determining the range of values for a phenotype as a function of aging. Examining the genetics of aging-associated conditions such as cardiovascular problems and osteoporosis is especially difficult because 1) they are "late-onset" conditions, affecting older individuals; and 2) they are "complex traits", with a number of genes contributing more or less to tipping the balance toward a phenotype or disease in one or another subgroup of an outbred population. Thus, traditional family genetic studies are difficult, and studies of association or linkage tend to be confounded.</p>
<p>As one aid to analyses of factors affecting aging-associated conditions and diseases, attention has increasingly focused on the promise of "founder populations" for the simplification of complex trait analysis. Such rare populations arise from a delimited group living in a defined region - in this case, the island of Sardinia - for many centuries with minimal admixture from outside populations. The high degree of relatedness in such a population helps in modern non-parametric analyses o localize and refine the localization of those genes. The Sardinian population is one of the few that is both numerous and accessible enough, and one of the most extreme in its relative homogeneity. It can thus be studied for a wide variety of both frequent and relatively rare traits. The attractiveness of Sardinia for study is increased by the concentration on a targeted region for the studies, Ogliastra, which has a particularly isolated population of 60,000, in an area enclosed by two mountain ranges and the sea.</p>
<p>The program examines phenotypes for which NIA expertise and test instruments are well developed, and which represent important aging-related conditions. The study has been scoring &gt;200 dichotomized traits (smoking, etc.) and over 100 quantitative traits ("endophenotypes" or "quantitative risk-related genetic or environmental factors") that can be scored on a continuous scale. The use of quantitative traits permits the study of the entire range of allelic variation in a population. The traits of particular interest include a range of cardiovascular risk factors, anthropometric measurements, blood test values, and facets of personality. <br /><br />Recruitment was completed for over 6,100 subjects from a selected group of four towns in east-central Sardinia where the traits for each subject was measured. Genotyping of all participants was also completed that has provided the data for investigators to look for genetic factors associated with each trait. The infrastructure for the clinic and phenotypic testing has been stable, with stringent quality control, and the data are of correspondingly high quality.</p>
<p>The sample cohort numbers over half of the population of the region aged 14-102; they are native-born, and at least 96 percent are known to have all grandparents born in the same province. The group include 4,933 phenotyped sib pairs, 4,266 phenotyped parent-child pairs, &gt;4,069 phenotyped cousin pairs, and &gt;6,459 phenotyped avuncular pairs. This sample is large enough and well enough phenotyped to show that even in this founder population, the variance for individual traits is comparable to that in outbred populations; and it is large enough and interrelated enough to infer highly significant estimates of genetic heritability for traits. With this cohort, full-genome scans with batteries of single-nucleotide markers were carried out, along with second visits to the testing center for repeated tests and additional tests related to bone-density and frailty; and third visits will be done within the tenure of the out-years of SardiNIA2, aiming at longitudinal data to supplement the cross-sectional data provided by first visits. <br /><br />A critical step in longitudinal studies would record data from a fourth visit of participants (Aim I); and transfer of the data (Aim II) would provide them for later use in a range of studies, A subsidiary Aim III would be to design the studies to maintain the option to study additional phenotypes. The study is designed to permit the estimation of individual trajectories of quantitative traits, which requires the measure of at least three points in time to avoid the bias resulting from "regression to the mean". A further advantage is that, by collecting multiple measurements over time, one can improve the power of mapping studies. Specifically, by modeling the repeated measures of each trait, one can focus on the long-term component of the trait for each individual.</p>
<p>Based on the proposed studies, the information recovered could facilitate ulterior analyses of age-related trends and the molecular nature of gene variations that are significant factors for traits of particular interest; and a platform for the possible extension of studies to other phenotypes and further longitudinal studies.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The Contractor shall extend the studies of aging-associated conditions in the especially favorable Sardinian population with longitudinal assays of traits, in order to sustain the later analysis of genetic factors involved in trait values and/or rates of change of values of a trait, and to move toward the identification of alleles that confer significant risk for extreme values of individual traits of interest in health and disease.</p>
<p>The specific Objective is to extend the longitudinal study of trends in quantitative trait values with a fourth clinic visit for the participants in the study. The Contractor shall be responsible for coordination of the data collection, including recruitment and scheduling of study participants, administration and scoring of tests for each trait and data entry and transfer. The Contractor shall provide maintenance of equipment; provide personnel, supervising their performance in the administration and scoring of the tests; and be responsible for computer entry and data transfer of the test data to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative.</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor shall be responsible for properly protecting all information used, gathered, or developed as a result of the Statement of Work (SOW). The Contractor shall establish and implement appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of sensitive Government information, data, and/or equipment.<br /><br />There are three goals for the proposed efforts to satisfy the Objective fully, consonant with the three AIMS: 1) Determine values for the specified range of phenotypes, including specified new traits, in the established cohort from the founder population of Sardinia, completing a fourth visit for the maximum of the 6,000+ initial recruits possibly available for the Tasks in SOW; 2) Provide the data (values) for all traits in electronic form and reports as specified, in order to support derived analyses and publications; and 3) Design the studies to maintain the option for later expansion of successful efforts to additional phenotypes and outcome studies in the founder population.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>A. Recruitment of Subjects and Staff, the Contractor shall develop a route to the projected goals for recruitment of subjects, including males and females from the established cohort of 6,000+ individuals; and the staff plan for the efforts, including staff recruitment and the identification of personnel to be trained in sonography and testing before studies of subjects are initiated. Phone contact shall facilitate scheduling; and as in the initial visits, the first subjects contacted for recruitment shall be those who have been identified as index cases with cardiovascular conditions, referred by their physicians, that warrant targeted investigation. These would be followed by relatives and controls from the rest of the cohort. B. Contacting and Scheduling Participants, the Contractor shall develop an Informed Consent form in Italian for the studies and receive prior written approval by the COTR prior to submission to Institutional Review Boards. The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining appropriate institutional review board approvals from local authorities, and for abiding by institutional review board rulings from NIA. The Contractor shall identify, recruit, and obtain informed consent for eligible volunteers. Participant recruitment shall be conducted so as to ensure a wide distribution of ages of participants, aiming at as much of the original subject cohort as possible. The Contractor shall be responsible for scheduling participants at the participating site(s). C. Tasks and phasing, TASK 1: Anthropometric measures and arterial stiffness and echographic assessments, the Contractor shall collect data using reliable anthropometric measures, non-invasive indices of arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity; PWV, Augmentation index; AGI), a non-invasive measure for arterial intimal-medial thickness (carotid intimal-medial thickness; IMT), and non-invasive measures of renal and thyroid ultrasound shall be performed by a trained test administrator. The cardiovascular-related measurements shall include blood pressure, heart rate, weight, height, waist to hip ratio, ankle brachial pressure index, carotid and heart bruits, as well as carotid intima-media thickness, carotid pressure-strain elastic modulus, and pulse wave velocity. At the time of testing, blood and urine samples shall be collected. A report shall be provided to each participant on selected phenotypes and related data. The report shall include data from Task 1 for which there are accepted public health practices and interventions and which are clinically well-known to the physicians, i.e. cholesterol, blood pressure, general physical parameters, etc. For the arterial stiffness measurements, the report shall indicate extreme values from carotid ultrasound that would correspond to clinical guidelines for interventions, and correspondingly extreme features from renal and thyroid ultrasound that indicate possible pathology that can be further investigated with their physician. For ankle brachial pressure index, augmentation index, echocardiogram, 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, and pulse-wave velocity. The NIA will provide standardized tests that shall be used and administered according to the standardized set of instructions in manuals provided in English by the NIA, including standardized tests for augmentation index, echocardiogram, 24 hour blood pressure monitoring, ankle brachial pressure index, renal ultrasound, and thyroid ultrasound. The COTR shall work closely with the Contractor to monitor training and testing sessions of testers, to maintain consistency both during the study and with other NIA studies. The Contractor shall report to the COTR on a monthly basis by telephone or email to review subject participation and any procedural difficulties. TASK 2: Assessments of frailty and cognitive state, 1) A lower leg PQCT scan to determine trabecular and total bone density; mechanical resistance to compression; cortical bone area and density; and muscle cross-sectional area; 2) Muscle strength testing by hand-grip strength; 3) Walking speed in a 4-meter test; 4) Self-report of exhaustion and unintentional weight loss, and level of physical activity. The Contractor shall incorporate the standard EPIC food frequency questionnaire to be completed by participants at home, or administered by an interviewer during a follow-up visit for those who experience difficulty in filling out the questionnaire; 5) Brief standard cognitive performance assessment, comprising mini-mental status examination, clocks test, fluency test, and short-term memory drawing test; and 6) The contractor shall incorporate in the third visits the standard CESD (Center for Epidemiological Study of Depression) assessment of symptoms of depression to facilitate association with frailty. TASK 3: Demographic and Short Symptom Checklist (SSCL) data, Two additional test instruments, supplied by NIA in an Italian version, shall be administered to the same population cohorts screened for arterial stiffness and personality phenotypes. One instrument is a short symptom checklist for various conditions (SSCL) and the other obtains basic demographic and family structure and composition information. The tests shall be administered with the supervision of a trained test administrator/ interviewer. TASK 4: Retinal, hearing, and facial morphology assessments, The Contractor shall collect data using reliable measures of retinal features, facial and ear morphology features, and hearing. For each subject, results shall be recorded for retinal 45 degree field photographs with a non-mydriatic retinal camera, a single photograph for each eye; for 10 photographs of frontal and 10 of side views of the head, and of hearing scored with best current practice for audiometry; TASK 5: Urine analysis and blood drawing, fractionation, sample storage, and assays, From each participant at each visit the following biological material shall be collected: 1) 10 ml of fasting morning (middle catch) urine shall be collected and stored at -80&deg; in ten(10) 1-mL aliquots, and 2) 50 ml of blood from overnight-fasting subjects shall be drawn and fractionated to provide at least: (a) from 40 mL, fourteen (14) 1-ml aliquots of EDTA-plasma and eight (8) 1-mL aliquots of heparin-plasma, four (4) full buffy coats, and two (2) samples of red blood cells; (b) from 10 ml of blood, about 640 ug of total DNA extracted in two (2) separate aliquots.

<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>This is a notice to acquire services to acquire services to continue Integration of disparate databases, maintenance and growth of the National Sawfish Encounter Database as a tool for assisting in the recovery of the federally endangered smalltooth sawfish. The smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) on April 1, 2003. During its listing process under the ESA, the National Sawfish Encounter Database (NSED), initially housed at Mote Marine Laboratory (MML), was created in 1999 as a tracking database to gather information regarding smalltooth sawfish encounters, both recent and historic. After the species was listed under the ESA in 2003, the database was maintained to assist recovery managers and researchers in the evaluation of sawfish abundance, range, habitat preferences, and as a mechanism to document the success of recovery initiatives.<br />The utility and desirability of maintaining and further developing the NSED has been repeatedly endorsed by the NMFS' Smalltooth Sawfish Recovery Team as the database serves as an essential tool in biological characterization, permitting, and regulatory processes. Thus, in September 2008, the NSED was transferred from MML to the Florida Program for Shark Research (FPSR) at the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH), University of Florida, with the intention of merging it with several similar databases having unique and sometimes additive or duplicative data. <br />Two primary objectives:<br />1) Construct a integrative and functional database that can be easily queried to address queries posed by researchers, managers, regulators, and other stake-holders; and,<br />2) Disseminate the contact information for the new location of the database while conducting outreach and education activities in an effort to increase public awareness regarding the importance of reporting sawfish encounters for the benefit of overall conservation efforts.<br />These goals will be reached in this funding period, but the NSED is regarded as an ongoing long-term project with encounters to be continuously reported, in theory more often as protection and management measures positively affect recovery. Given the very low population sizes of this federal endangered species, encounter data is extremely valuable, making the continuity of this project vital for the success of the recovery of the smalltooth sawfish population.<br />As an ongoing project, most of the NSED initiatives that started in late 2008 must continue during the next project year. Most the database integration process has been completed, but there is unfinished work. Furthermore, because the public has to be continually educated about the status of sawfishes and the need to report encounters, during 2009 all outreach initiatives started in 2009 will continue and be augmented. Additionally, innovative tasks are presented for 2010 regarding both the database integration and the outreach initiatives.<br />Task 1: Database integration and archival (months 1 to 6).<br />Task 2: Ongoing adding of new records to the database (months 1 to 12).<br />Task 3: Development of a database in Microsoft Access format (months 7 to 12).<br />Task 4: Outreach initiatives (months 1 to 12).
<p>This information is needed to determine potential fishing interactions and is vital to the management and recovery of the species. The data is proprietary and can only be obtained through The Florida Museum of Natural History under the University of Florida. The government knows of only one source other than the Florida Museum of Natural History that is capable of providing this service: To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the services and satisfy or exceed the Government's needs. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this type of services previously, and detailed narrative that described your facility and ability to provide this service, along with the individual work knowledge and experience. Interested parties must respond within (10) days after publication of this notice. The government knows of only one source. The government invites firms that believe they have the capability to meet the requirement to response, providing specific information that will enable the government to determine whether or not to compete the requirement.

<SUBJECT>Device 2F176 Modification Efforts
<SOLNBR>KC-130T
<RESPDATE>071910
<CONTACT>Linda C. Sujansky, Contract Specialist, Phone 4073804845, Email linda.sujansky@navy.mil
<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) only:
<p>The 2F176 is a containerized, non-motion based KC-130T Aircrew Procedures Trainer (APT) used by the United States Navy Reserves (USNR) and the United States Marine Corps Reserves (USMCR), located at the Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth, Texas. The USNR is considering modification of the visual system and resolving reflective memory card obsolescence.</p>
<p>Currently the system does not support cross cockpit viewing as the viewing point is limited to either the pilot or co-pilot positions rendering the trainer unusable for initial pilot training. In order to address this concern the USN is proposing replacement of the current display system. The current system has a Stewart film screen for the real display system. The system uses three Barco 808 projectors and an ESIG 5330 Image Generator (IG). The trainer has Night Vision Goggle (NVG) capabilities. The USN analysis suggests replacement to a collimated display which allows for cross cockpit viewing by the pilot and co-pilot. The USN has concerns of the resulting performance impact on currently installed projection system and IG given installation of a new display system.</p>
<p>Additionally, the current computational system architecture of Device 2F176 utilizes a reflective memory network to interconnect the Host, IOS (Instructor Operator Station), Blue Ridge Weather Radar and I/O (Input / Output) computational subsystems. The Host is currently running Red Hat 7 and the IOS is running Windows 2000. The Blue Ridge Weather Radar utilizes a generic weather database that does not require correlation with visual database scenery. The USNR has identified reflective memory cards (PCI-5587A, PCI-5588, PCI-5587-110, and VME-5588-210) associated with each of these subsystems as obsolete. The existing Host and IOS computer architectures are supportable and hardware upgrades to these subsystems are not critical. The existing reflective memory cards, associated wiring, software drivers, and application interface software requires replacement and/or modification such that the obsolescence issue is resolved, long term life-cycle supportability is enhanced and the baseline trainer performance is not degraded.</p>
<p>Information Requested. (Request that responses be limited to ten pages.)</p>
<p>Provide a potential design overview and recommended hardware/software solution to deliver real time cross cockpit viewing on Device 2F176 during all phases of flight.</p>
<p>Provide experience in visual system integration, specifically replacement to collimated display system integration and replacement to include experience with structural analysis associated with such efforts.</p>
<p>Provide approach to assess the impact and risks associated with the replacement of the 2F176 display system to other elements of the visual system including the projectors and IG. Assessment shall consider reuse of the currently installed projectors, IG and databases. Additionally the assessment shall provide consideration to ensure that current visual system performance is not degraded as a result of the display system replacement. Identify challenges and technical approach associated with installing a collimated or alternative display within the Device 2F176.</p>
<p>Provide experience with shared / reflective memory solutions implementation, and/or alternate solutions, associated with training systems. Provide recommended hardware/software solution to address the obsolete reflective memory network and enhance the long term life-cycle supportability of the training system. In the event that multiple solutions are offered request that the response include comparisons of life cycle costs of each and trade offs of each compared to the other(s).</p>
<p>Provide approach to satisfy USN Information Assurance (IA) requirements, in accordance with DODI 8500.2 Information Assurance (IA) Implementation, for training system software affected by proposed design to provide the cross cockpit viewing and reflective memory solution.</p>
<p>Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM). Request that the ROM be broken into areas of: display replacement, image generator and projectors, if required, resulting from display system replacement, and reflective memory solution.</p>
<p>Identify the delivery schedule to accomplish the visual display replacement and share memory obsolescence issues. Request that response identify trainer downtime required for in-plant development and to support on-site integration. Schedule should identify requirements for access to Government Furnished Information (GFI)/Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and Government Personnel (Pilots, instructors).</p>
<p>Considering your company's current and projected workload, please describe how your company would provide the necessary staff to accomplish the work identified.</p>
<p>Please list any ground rules and/or assumptions that your company recommends for this effort. As an example: estimated period of performance, availability of government furnished equipment/government furnished information (GFE/GFI), etc.</p>
<p>Please describe your physical capacity for taking on this additional effort, taking into account current workload, and what plans you have if the physical capacity needs to be increased as a result of this proposed effort.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is a request for information only, not a solicitation, or offer to do business of any kind. Any response to this request should be undertaken at your own risk and expense.</p>
<p>To assist interested contractors in their responses, drawings of Device 2F176 are provided as an attachment to this RFI.</p>

<DESC>Contract Extension:  NOTICE OF INTENT
Solicitation/Contract Number:  DE-AC05-01OR22877
Description:
The United States Department of Energy (DOE) intends to extend the current Cold Shutdown (CSD) contract with the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) at the Portsmouth site to continue Surveillance and Maintenance (S&M) and deactivation activities of returned facilities and any other Gaseous Diffusion Plant (GDP) facilities returned by USEC to DOE, and deactivation activities in USEC-leased facilities in accordance with all the applicable laws, regulations, DOE Directives, permits, and agreements and Orders.  The proposed contract extension is for 6 months (3 months with a 3 month option) from October 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011.  
The S&M activities may include safety and maintenance activities that are similar in nature to those of CSD, particularly the performance of S&M of equipment required to ensure protection of the general public, facility and worker safety, regulatory compliance functions, and shutdown of non-essential systems to lower infrastructure costs and to reduce overall facility hazards.  The essential services required to meet the Department?s needs under the S&M task include but are not limited to:
?	Continued S&M activities essential for nuclear criticality safety/radiological safety and documented facility safety requirements for the PORTS facilities returned by USEC to DOE;?	Continued site infrastructure, utilities, and security services essential to multiple user site operations and national security for the PORTS facilities returned by USEC to DOE;?	Implement and provide documentation of the transition from the current NRC regulatory environment to Atomic Energy Act  and DOE orders for the PORTS facilities returned by USEC to DOE; ?	Develop and provide a transition plan for the transfer of S&M responsibilities to the new D&D contractor for the PORTS facilities returned by USEC to DOE; and ?	Conduct winterization and excess material accountability to ensure protection of the general public, provide facility and worker safety, and to perform regulatory compliance functions for the PORTS facilities returned by USEC to DOE.
The essential services required to meet the Department?s needs under the deactivation task may include but are not limited to:
?	Ongoing removal of unsafe material deposits including LEU and HEU deposits, flammable liquids, and environmentally sensitive materials (e.g., PCB liquids) needed to support reduction of facility hazards and accelerate the transition to D&D;?	Utility shutdown and cell debuffering for non-essential facilities and systems for the PORTS facilities returned by USEC to DOE;?	Ongoing removal/recycle and separation of excess DOE materials from USEC-owned materials, continuation of processing LEU cylinders as a part of the site clean-up, continuation of processing DOE-owned oxides in the X-705 Facility; and?	Demobilization of the X-326 DR and X-705 Uranium Recovery activities
The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is the Competition in Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The present contract with USEC is due to expire on September 30, 2010.  The proposed contract extension will allow environmental S&M and deactivation activities to continue at the Portsmouth site until transition to a new D&D contractor.  
USEC is the only contractor who has the unique qualifications to ensure the continuation of the necessary S&M and deactivation activities at the Portsmouth site which will ensure the safety of the general public, facilities, and workers during the months before the transition to the new D&D contractor.  In addition, it is the only contractor which can maintain facilities and site regulatory compliance while lowering infrastructure costs and reducing overall facility hazards.  The DOE anticipates award of the new competitive D&D contract in the 1st quarter of Fiscal Year 2011 as published on the DOE EM Acquisition Forecast website (last updated 10/13/2009).  
THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS UNDER FAR PART 12, 15, OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS UNDER FAR PART 14.  IF PARTIES CHOOSE TO RESPOND, ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RESPONDENT AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT.   Interested parties believing they have all of the capabilities may submit capability statements to provide all of the services, including a demonstration of the ability to meet all of the needs identified above within the required timeframes.  The capabilities statement describing and demonstrating the above shall be submitted within 15 days of publication of this notice to the following address:  U.S. Department of Energy, Portsmouth/Paducah Project Office, 1017 Majestic Drive, Suite 200, Lexington, KY 40513, ATTN: David R.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION41 USC 253c (1)ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE ANDNO OTHER SERVICES WILL SATISFY AGENCY REQUIREMENTS
AUTHORITYIn accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.304, this justification to enter into a contract with Rolls-Royce Navel Marine Inc, under the authority of 41 USC 253c (1) as outlined in FAR 6.302-1, is herein prepared on behalf of the Department of Interior, National Park Service, and the Ohio Major Acquisition Buying OfficeBACKGROUNDDue to the designed mission of the MV Ranger III and the Subchapter-H designation by the USCG, the vessel is an "Inspected Vessel" and is under the purview of the USCG and American Bureau of Shipping standards. The operating systems on board the vessel were designed and installed by Rolls-Royce Marine Inc. On June 08, 2010 while underway from Houghton, MI to Isle Royale the vessel suffered a failure of the remote propulsion controls due to loss of power and was forced to suspend the voyage and contact the USCG. The USCG Marine Safety Office suspended operation of the vessel through a CG-835 until an OEM technician from Rolls-Royce Marine could perform an analysis of the system and determine cause of failure and provide a report on corrective measures and repairs. Through this process it was determined that the vessel does not have "True" alternative manual control of engine RPM or pitch control of the propulsion system from the pilot house or engine room in case of emergencies such as loss of power. The USCG has given the NPS until July 29, 2010 to correct these deficiencies that were identified or use of the vessel will be cancelled indefinitely until repaired and inspected.  Due to the complexity of the on board operating systems and the design by Rolls-Royce Marine and proprietary controls over design and required computer operating programs Roll-Royce Marine is the only vendor that can perform the required design and installation of equipment to perform repairs to meet USCG Marine Safety Office 835 and 46CFR62.25-10, 46CFR62.35-(b) and 46CFR62.30 to place the MV Ranger III back in operation and insure the safety of the vessel and passengers.  JUSTIFICATIONIn accordance with FAR 6.303-2, the following facts and rationale is provided for the justification of a single-source procurement.
1.	Agency: Department of the Interior, National Park ServiceContracting Activity: Ohio Major Acquisition Buying Office
2.	Description of Action Being Approved: Single source procurement to Rolls-Royce Naval Marine rd to provide final design, software update and resolution to the propulsion system failure. 
3.	Description of the Supplies or Services: Emergency Repairs, design services for controls and computer operating programs for the Roll-Royce propulsion system of the Ranger III, Isle Royale National Park, Houghton, MI.
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open: FAR 6.302-1(b)(2) and 6.302-2(a)(2)(b)(1)(2).
5.	Contractor's Unique Qualifications: Complexity of the on board operating systems and the design by Rolls-Royce Marine and proprietary controls over design and required computer operating programs Roll-Royce Marine is the only vendor that can perform the required design and installation of equipment to perform repairs to meet USCG Marine Safety Office 835 and 46CFR62.25-10, 46CFR62.35-(b) and 46CFR62.30 to place the MV Ranger III back in operation and insure the safety of the vessel and passengers.
6.	Effort to Ensure Offers are Solicited: GSA advantage was researched to see if any vendors were capable of designing, providing design results, and repairing the Rolls-Royce Marine propulsion system.  Three (3) vendors stated that the system contains proprietary controls and is not on the GSA contract but instead may try open market.  However, portions of the system remain proprietary and would require additional costs for design of the repairs from Rolls-Royce Marine.
7.	Costs are Fair and Reasonable: It has been determined, based on the previous work performed by this company and the government estimates for this work, that the anticipated cost to the government for this follow-on work will be fair and reasonable.
8.	Market Research: GSA advantage was researched to see if any vendors were capable of designing, providing design results, and repairing the Rolls-Royce Marine propulsion system.  Three (3) vendors stated that the system contains proprietary controls and is not on the GSA contract but instead may try open market.  However,  portions of the system remain proprietary and would require additional costs for design of the repairs from Rolls-Royce Marine.      9.	Rolls-Royce Marine and proprietary controls over design and required computer operating programs.   Roll-Royce Marine is the only vendor that can perform the required design and installation of equipment to perform repairs to meet USCG Marine Safety Office 835 and 46CFR62.25-10, 46CFR62.35-(b) and 46CFR62.30 to place the MV Ranger III back in operation and insure the safety of the vessel and passengers.

<p>ONR is exploring the potential for the next generation of autonomous capabilities to permit reliable resupply / retrograde (and potentially even casualty evacuation) under adverse conditions by unmanned air cargo / utility systems for distributed small units in a theater of military operations. Specifically, ONR is interested in technologies relevant to cargo UAS missions in the areas of perception/sensing, autonomous control and planning, and human interaction. <br />It is envisioned that "application developers" would create modules for specific capabilities, such as:<br />&bull; Autonomous approach selection and landing zone suitability assessment<br />&bull; Launch / recovery with little or no human supervision, including by a relatively unskilled user with limited time in the field<br />&bull; Operations to / from slopes, unprepared terrain and ships (sea state 4-5) in adverse weather, night, degraded visual environment, GPS denied conditions<br />&bull; Highly automated mission planning and fully autonomous dynamic replanning when operating beyond line of sight<br />&bull; Obstacle detection and avoidance<br />&bull; Avoidance and evasion of known threats</p>
<p>ONR envisions an open-systems / non-proprietary architecture, integrated with these application modules that will permit the use of the best technologies, allow independent government assessments, and provide maximum UAS community benefit. ONR is looking for the most innovative and capable technologies that industry and academia are developing that could be flight demonstrated within the next 4-6 years (on an existing platform).</p>
<p>The briefing will be held on 21 July 2010 at the Executive Conference Center of Strategic Analysis, Inc, 4075 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22203, from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm. There is no cost to attend. Interested parties must register via the ONR conference website by 14 July 2010. Details can be found at:</p>
<p>https://secure.onr.navy.mil/events/regdetail.asp?cid=672</p>
<p>If requested attendance exceeds the capacity of the conference room, it will be necessary to limit attendance of personnel from each organization.<br />The briefing and a survey will be posted to the registration website prior to the meeting in order to facilitate understanding and improve the utility of informal and formal feedback on ONR's vision, goals and approach.</p>

<DESC>This posting is a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentations (PEO STRI) Synthetic Environment (SE) Core Common Virtual Environment (CVE) Management Program.  The SE Core CVE Management effort focuses on delivering software and limited hardware to enable an interoperable CVE for training of the Warfighters. The ultimate objective of SE Core is to facilitate a virtual training environment supporting mission focused unit training that approximates the changing contemporary operational environment.<BR><BR>Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), Army Training Strategies, Army Modernization Programs, Joint/Army Training Doctrine, Joint/Army Battle Command Training Support, and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) require a fully integrated LVC Training Environment (TE).  The SE Core program is the Armys virtual component of the LVC TE.  SE Core will develop and sustain the Armys CVE which links current and future virtual simulation devices into an interoperable full spectrum training capability. The CVE will connect to gaming training enablers and the live and constructive environments for an integrated LVC TE capability.  <BR><BR>As the Army transitions to a campaign-quality Army with a Joint and expeditionary mindset, our Soldiers require relevant, on demand training available anywhere, anytime, and tailored to their operational training requirements.  SE Core is comprised of complementary efforts for developing the CVE that facilitates fair fight interoperability for virtual system and non-system Training Aids Devices Simulators and Simulations (TADSS).  The program develops operational training terrain databases, models, and simulation architecture connectivity to meet Warfighter operational training requirements.  The terrain and model development efforts provide non-proprietary, open format, and image generator independent CVE deliverables.  The simulation architecture provides an integrated training network.  These efforts, linking current and future virtual training devices/simulations, enables the Army to execute combined arms and joint training, as well as mission planning and rehearsals at home station and at deployed locations. <BR><BR>Since SE Cores system development and demonstration phase, requirements for training and SE Core have grown. SE Core will continue to produce terrain databases, common moving models, the virtual simulation architecture, changes to OneSAF, and common virtual components such as but not limited to After Action Review, Interoperability Gateway, Scenario Generation Tool, and C4I Adapter.  New requirements include but are not limited to: CVE capability management for system and non-system TADSS, mission planning and rehearsal visualization capability, acquisition of terrain source data, development of database centers, SE Core to TADSS plug-in expansion, sound and smell representation, semi-automated forces development and integration, exercise preparation and execution capabilities and definitions for the terms interoperability and fair fight.  SE Core will also facilitate integration and updates concerning OneSAF and SE Core version releases into system and non-system virtual TADSS.  <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the SE Core CVE Management competition will be conducted on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis with best-value tradeoff evaluation procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 541512.  The small business size standard is $25M (this is only applicable to small business Offerors who wish to participate in this full and open competition).  The Government anticipates that the SE Core CVE Management solicitation will result in a five year single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract.   This is a Draft RFP and PEO STRI anticipates issuing the final RFP on 16 August 2010.<BR><BR>The SE Core CVE Management anticipated funding profile by fiscal year (FY) is provided below:<BR><BR>FY11  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $8M<BR>	Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M, SW Development - $9M<BR>	Total: $19.75M<BR><BR>FY12  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $10.8M<BR>	Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M, SW Development - $4M<BR>	Total: $17.55M<BR><BR>FY13  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $8.8M<BR>	Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M<BR>	Total: $11.55M<BR><BR>FY14  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $9.7M<BR>	Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M<BR>	Total: $12.45M<BR><BR>FY15  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $19.5M<BR>	Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M<BR>	Total: $22.25M<BR><BR>Questions/Comments:  Any questions or comments on the draft RFP shall be submitted in writing via email to all POCs listed below no later than 3:30PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 16 July 2010. <BR><BR>Reference: The Synopsis for this SE Core action was posted to Fedbizopps on 2 July 2010.<BR><BR>The Government will not, under any circumstances, pay for Bid and Proposal (B&P) costs for Offerors who choose to prepare proposals in response to issuance of an RFP.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address:<BR>Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation<BR>SFAE-STRI-KOP<BR>12350 Research Parkway<BR>Orlando, FL 32826<BR><BR>Points of Contact:<BR>Laura Parsons, Contract Specialist - 407-380-8036; laura.parsons@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Lauren Bushika, Contract Specialist - 407-208-3343; lauren.bushika@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Milton Washington, Contracting Officer  407-381-8854; milton.washington@us.army.mil<BR><BR>

<DESC>ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit sources and pricing  under the authority of FAR 13.500 to APPLIED SCIENCE ASSOCIATES,INC., 55 VILLAGE SQUARE DR, STE 6, WAKEFIELD, RI 02879-8248, - -  3D oil fate model that will link to an existing contaminant fate and transport models used to assess impacts of dredging operations on the environment.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures  --- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than Friday, 9 July 2010 -  11:00 A.M., CDST.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.    Interested parties may submit quotes for consideration by the Government to ellaine.r.james@usace.army.mil.   Technical POC -- Mansour Zakikhani - mansour.zakikhani@usace.army.mil. Please use solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR><BR>1.  Environmental models are integral and indispensable tools for the assessment and prediction of the environmental impacts of oil spills.  We use models to extrapolate the field observations and predict the long-term potential environmental impacts.  The Water Quality and Contaminant Modeling Branch (WQCMB), Environmental Laboratory, will need to expand its capabilities in the area of fate and transport of oil slicks.   Hydrodynamic and water quality modeling of the Gulf of Mexico linked with a state-of-art, three-dimensional (3D) fate and transport oil slick model can be adapted for predicting short- and long-term ecosystem impacts.  <BR><BR>2.  Over the past three decades, intensive research has been done to develop mathematical models to hindcast and/or forecast the fate and transport of spilled oil and oil products in marine environments. Research is also being conducted both in the United States and abroad to assess if and how to chemically disperse oil from a subsurface blowout similar to what has happened in the Gulf of Mexico.  A number of oil spill models have been developed and applied by several companies and government agencies.  These models are classified with respect to their stage of evolution as first-, second-, and third-generation models. The third-generation model or the comprehensive oil spill model simulates the fate and transport of oil in three dimensions and includes advection, diffusion, surface spreading, vertical mechanical dispersion, evaporation, emulsification, stranding and may have modules to deal with subsurface blowout problems. Most of the models that have been developed by universities are proprietary; they have been developed for research purposes and do not have practical applications. The General NOAA Oil Modeling Environment (GNOME) is a public domain model, but it is a two-dimensional, surface-only spill model.  There are other commercially available 3-D models, but SIMAP has been reported to be a state-of-art comprehensive model that has all the processes needed for our modeling simulations.  SIMAP, which can be linked to ERDC hydrodynamic and water quality models, contains the following major components: <BR><BR>" Physical fates model for estimates of surface distribution and subsurface concentrations of the spilled oil and its components over time. <BR>" Biological effects model for estimates of impacts resulting from a spill scenario on fish, shellfish, wildlife, and for each of a series of habitats (environments) affected by the spill. <BR> <BR>" Currents that transport contaminant(s) and organisms that are entered using the graphical user interface or generated using a (separate) hydrodynamic model. Alternatively, existing current data sets may be imported. <BR>" Environmental, chemical, and biological databases that supply required information to the model for computation of fates and effects. <BR><BR>In SIMAP, both the physical fates and biological effects models are 3 D. There is also a two-dimensional oil spill model for quick trajectories and screening of scenarios and a 3 D stochastic model for risk assessment and contingency planning applications. The models are coupled to a geographic information system (GIS), which contains environmental and biological data, and also to databases of physical-chemical properties and biological abundance, containing necessary inputs for the models. The computer-based system operates on Windows 95(+) or Windows NT/XP with user friendly graphical inputs for running the models, editing data, and viewing model output. This option makes the model capable for use in remote or field locations. The model has been applied to a variety of marine and freshwater environments for use in response and contingency planning, risk assessment, and training.<BR><BR>3.  Currently, we have the need to be able to predict the fate of oil spilled in the Gulf of Mexico relative to Corps of Engineers projects.  This SIMAP model, developed and supported by ASA, is the only 3D oil fate model that will link to our existing contaminant fate and transport models used to assess impacts of dredging operations on the environment.  Results of these model simulations are needed to meet regulatory criteria associated with navigation operations in Mississippi and Mobile Rivers and harbors.  ASA is the only vendor (source) that can provide requirements in regards to effects of oil spills on Corps of Engineers projects. ERDC with the above-described, state-of-the-art SIMAP model.  The SIMAP model and associated training (available only from ASA) will enhance our capability to meet these mission.<BR>

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Capabilities-Based Development Planning, Studies and Analysis (CB-DPS&amp;A)
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: This is Call 1 to the Open-Ended Broad Agency Announcement posted on 1 Aug 08.</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: ASC-XR BAA-08-01</p>
<p>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION<br />The primary objective of this Airborne Electronic Attack Technology Maturation Configuration Study is to better understand industry's potential solutions to meet future platform requirements by defining and maturing critical technologies that are required to enable effective airborne communications network attack. Objectives for this effort include:</p>
<p>1) A paper concept design to include a high fidelity/confidence cost estimate of the concept design and associated life cycle costs</p>
<p>2) Identification of all medium and high risk or critical components, assemblies, subsystems, and integrations and demonstration (lab demonstration and/or flight) of those selected by the government</p>
<p>Specific descriptions of the above objectives are available in the ACNAE Statement of Objectives which accompanies this call</p>
<p>Specific technical details required to bind this technology risk reduction effort are provided in a classified annex to this call. Offerors may request this document via email to the Technical POC listed in Section VII of this document. All requests must include the Offerors Federal CAGE code, a Security point of contact, a mailing address capable of receipt of material up to the SECRET//NOFORN level, and a telephone number for the security point of contact.</p>
<p>The project vision is to mitigate a significant portion of the capability and capacity gaps that hamper Department of Defense (DOD) Airborne Electronic Attack (AEA) by pursuing a common delivery system with mature technology to minimize development time and reduce time required for airworthiness certification on multiple airframes. The results of this study could flow into many current and/or planned USAF acquisition programs.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION<br />The US Government anticipates awarding up to three (3) FFP contracts within a total budget of $3,000,000 for all three. However, the Government reserves the right to not award any contracts or any number up to, but not more than 3 contracts associated with this BAA call. Under this call, configuration analysis is sought to define and mature select critical technologies required to enable effective counter-communications jamming. The goal is to mature these technologies to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6+ by the middle of FY12. It is anticipated that this technology will then transition into a formal Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EM&amp;D) program.</p>

<p>The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.</p>
<p><br />V. PROPOSAL REVIEW INFORMATION (ONE STEP PROCESS) <br />Basis for Award<br />ALL THE EVALUATION CRITERIA SET FORTH BELOW WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THESE PROPOSALS IN LIEU OF THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN THE BAA. THE AWARDEE(S) WILL BE SELECTED BASED ON THE BEST VALUE TO THE GOVERNMENT WITH ALL THREE FACTORS FIGURED IN.</p>
<p>Evaluation criteria: The selection of one or more studies for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's proposal (technical, price, and risk) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the call. The technical aspect, which is ranked higher than the price aspect, shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are of equal importance:</p>
<p>Technical/Management<br />Overall Technical Merits -The proposal demonstrates that offeror has the capability to produce AEA systems and perform modifications to their host platforms. The proposal demonstrates the offeror understands and will address the integration challenges associated with their proposed air vehicle solution to meet the capability needs of a future AEA system.</p>
<p>Maturity of Solution - The offeror(s) demonstrate that it is/they are capability and resources are sufficient to accomplish the study objectives for their proposed solution(s) that can meet a transition to a formal acquisition program at Milestone B in 2012.</p>
<p>Related Experience - The offeror must demonstrate mastery of the challenges of integrating existing subsystems into their proposed air vehicle solution based on the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives. The offeror has available qualified technical personnel for the study who are critical to achieving the proposed objectives and have experience with systems integration that meets AEA technical and schedule requirements.</p>
<p>Proposal Risk Assessment<br />Proposal risk will be assessed using the technical evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to <br />the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror(s) proposed solution <br />to accomplishing the AEA Technology Maturation Configuration Study design<br />implementation and not this configuration study per se. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will <br />be weighed against the potential payoff.</p>
<p>Price<br />This Call anticipates that up to three (3) Firm Fixed Price contracts will be awarded within the total budget of $3,000,000. The offeror's price proposal will be evaluated to assess reasonableness and realism of the proposed effort and to determine that fair value will be received for the specified price.</p>
<p>Review and Selection Process<br />a. Categories: The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>i. Category I: Proposal is well conceived, analytically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are determined to be acceptable, but will be recommended for award based upon availability of funds. They are normally displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br />ii. Category II: Proposal is analytically or technically sound, but requires further development, and may be recommended for award based upon availability of funds, but at a lower priority than Category I.<br />iii. Category III: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs and will not be awarded a contract.</p>
<p>b. No other evaluation criteria will be used. The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award of a contract any, all, part or none of the proposal(s) received.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Award Notices: Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award, by letter or e-mail, on or about 29 August 2010.</p>

<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that all Contractor employees assigned hereunder shall undergo a background investigation or other applicable personnel security procedures to determine their suitability for access to ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities. For the purpose of this contract, the term background investigation will be utilized to also reference other personnel security procedures that may be applied in lieu of a full background investigation.</p>

<p>The Contractor must submit a copy of a tentative employment offer with the personnel suitability and security package when it is submitted on a potential Contractor employee.<br />The Contractor is hereby advised that a background investigation may take sixty (60) days or more to complete, depending on the complexity of the background investigation. The Contractor is encouraged to fill all positions with employees who have recently been the subject of a Federal background investigation.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the background investigation, the Personnel Security Branch will make a favorable or unfavorable determination and advise the COTR and the Contracting Officer (CO). The CO or the COTR is responsible for advising the Contractor of ATF's determination.</p>
<p>Contractor employees are not authorized to access ATF proprietary information, information technology systems, and/or facilities, until a favorable determination has been made by the Personnel Security Branch in accordance with agency specific qualifications, DOJ policy, Federal suitability, and/or adjudicative guidelines.</p>
<p>All background investigations will be adjudicated applying the suitability standards under 5 CFR, part 731, as well as the following DOJ policy and ATF agency specific qualifications:</p>
<p>(1) DOJ Residency Requirement. Immediately prior to gaining access to ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities the PSB staff ensures all Contractor employees have:</p>

<p>(b) Worked for the United States in a foreign country in a Federal or military capacity for three (3) out of the last five (5) years; and/or</p>
<p>(c) Been a dependent of a Federal or military employee in a foreign country for three (3) out of the last five (5) years.</p>
<p>(2) Allied Nations List. Contractor employees that only require access to ATF facilities must be United States citizens or foreign nationals legally permitted to reside in the United States. Their country of citizenship must be listed on the Allied Nations list published by the Department of State, Office of the Assistant Legal Advisor for Treaty Affairs. Since countries on this list are subject to change, refer to the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm.</p>
<p>(3) Drug Policy. ATF Drug Policy for ATF Applicants is applied. The PSB ensures that ATF Contractor employees are compliant with the policy prior to authorizing access to ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities.</p>
<p>(4) Selective Service. PSB will verify that all laws of the Selective Service are adhered to.</p>
<p>(5) Financial Responsibilities. The PSB ensures compliance with DOJ guidance surrounding financial obligations.</p>
<p>(a) Public Trust Positions - All financial obligations imposed by law must be favorably resolved through proof of payment and/or participation in a payment plan. For all other debt-related issues a risk management decision may be made in lieu of requiring payment or a payment plan. (Depending upon the position and debt history, PSB may require proof of payment and/or participation in a payment plan for financial delinquencies that are not imposed by law.)</p>
<p>(b) National Security Positions - All delinquent financial obligations, even those not imposed by law, must be favorably resolved through proof of payment, and/or participation in a payment plan, or otherwise resolved.<br /><br />(6) Foreign Nationals Accessing Information Technology Systems. DOJ Order 2640.2F Information Technology Security, states non-U.S. citizens shall not be authorized to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department IT systems.</p>
<p>(7) Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12. The PSB will conduct Personal Identity Verification to confirm the identity of the Contractor employee. Contractor employees must personally present two forms of identification in original form prior to accessing ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities. At least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID.</p>
<p>In the event a contract employee is found to be non-compliant with the agency specific qualifications, PSB will notify the COTR and the CO. The request for investigation will be terminated and the contractor may be requested to submit another name and complete personnel suitability and security package. Additional agency specific qualifications may be implemented without notice to the Contractor. <br /><br />Denial or Disapproval of Access to ATF Information, Information Technology Systems, and/or Facilities</p>
<p>In the event that a Contractor employee is denied or disapproved for access to ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities due to issues found during the background investigation, the Personnel Security Branch will notify the COTR and the CO. The contractor may be requested to submit another name and complete personnel suitability and security package.</p>
<p>Freedom of Information Act Requests</p>
<p>Once a determination has been made by the PSB, a Contractor employee may receive a copy of his/her background investigative file by submitting a written Freedom of Information Act request. The request must be addressed to the Disclosure Division, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, 99 New York Avenue, NE, Suite 1E-400, Washington, DC 20226. It is the responsibility of the Contractor employee to assume all monetary liabilities associated with such request.</p>
<p>Police Check Inquiries</p>
<p>In those instances where the Contractor believes that its employees will not need unescorted access to ATF facilities, or access to any ATF proprietary information, data or information technology systems, the Contractor shall notify the COTR. The COTR will then apprise ATF's PSB of the Contractor's initial determination, citing the reasons thereof. The PSB, in consultation with the COTR or the CO, will make the final determination as to whether or not the Contractor employee will need to undergo a background investigation. The nature and specific degree of background investigation will be determined by the PSB, depending upon the nature and degree of risk associated with the contract position. When ATF's PSB determines that the Contractor will require escorted access to ATF facilities, and/or ATF construction sites, or will only be provided with access to ATF non-sensitive information, the Contractor employee must undergo a criminal history check. The Physical Security Programs Branch or the respective field division/office is responsible for conducting the criminal history check and making the favorable or unfavorable determination.</p>
<p>Access to Classified National Security Information</p>
<p>In the event the Contractor employee requires access to classified National Security Information (NSI), in order to fulfill contractual requirements, the COTR or the CO must contact the PSB. The PSB will assess the requirements and make a determination if access to NSI is required at the Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret level (which may or may not include access to Sensitive Compartmented Information. If the PSB determines that access to NSI is required, the contract must be modified to incorporate the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program (NISP).

Containing a 512 x 512 Frame Transfer CCD sensor from E2V Technologies, it enables charge to be multiplied on the sensor before it is read out, while utilizing the full QE performance of the CCD sensor. The absolute EMCCD gain of the camera can be varied linearly from unity up to a thousand times directly through the software, via a true quantitative EM gain scale. Andor is the first to offer this technology as a complete, software controlled system for scientific digital imaging applications. The system offers up to 10 MHz pixel readout rate, both EMCCD and conventional amplifier outputs and benefits from minimized dark current with unequalled thermoelectric cooling down to -100&deg;C.</p>

For items that are serialized within the part, lot, or batch number within the enterprise identifier, the unique item identifier shall include the data elements of the enterprise identifier; the original part, lot, or batch number; and the serial number.<br />"Enterprise" means the entity (e.g., a manufacturer or vendor) responsible for assigning unique item identifiers to items.<br />"Enterprise identifier" means a code that is uniquely assigned to an enterprise by an issuing agency.<br />"Government's unit acquisition cost" means-<br />(1) For fixed-price type line, subline, or exhibit line items, the unit price identified in the contract at the time of delivery; <br />(2) For cost-type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items, the Contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost to the Government at the time of delivery; and<br />(3) For items produced under a time-and-materials contract, the Contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost to the Government at the time of delivery.<br />"Issuing agency" means an organization responsible for assigning a non-repeatable identifier to an enterprise (i.e., Dun &amp; Bradstreet's Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number, GS1 Company Prefix, or Defense Logistics Information System (DLIS) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code).<br />"Issuing agency code" means a code that designates the registration (or controlling) authority for the enterprise identifier.<br />"Item" means a single hardware article or a single unit formed by a grouping of subassemblies, components, or constituent parts. <br />"Lot or batch number" means an identifying number assigned by the enterprise to a designated group of items, usually referred to as either a lot or a batch, all of which were manufactured under identical conditions.<br />"Machine-readable" means an automatic identification technology media, such as bar codes, contact memory buttons, radio frequency identification, or optical memory cards.<br />"Original part number" means a combination of numbers or letters assigned by the enterprise at item creation to a class of items with the same form, fit, function, and interface.<br />"Parent item" means the item assembly, intermediate component, or subassembly that has an embedded item with a unique item identifier or DoD recognized unique identification equivalent.<br />"Serial number within the enterprise identifier" means a combination of numbers, letters, or symbols assigned by the enterprise to an item that provides for the differentiation of that item from any other like and unlike item and is never used again within the enterprise.<br />"Serial number within the part, lot, or batch number" means a combination of numbers or letters assigned by the enterprise to an item that provides for the differentiation of that item from any other like item within a part, lot, or batch number assignment.<br />"Serialization within the enterprise identifier" means each item produced is assigned a serial number that is unique among all the tangible items produced by the enterprise and is never used again. The enterprise is responsible for ensuring unique serialization within the enterprise identifier.<br />"Serialization within the part, lot, or batch number" means each item of a particular part, lot, or batch number is assigned a unique serial number within that part, lot, or batch number assignment. The enterprise is responsible for ensuring unique serialization within the part, lot, or batch number within the enterprise identifier.<br />"Unique item identifier" means a set of data elements marked on items that is globally unique and unambiguous. The term includes a concatenated unique item identifier or a DoD recognized unique identification equivalent.<br />"Unique item identifier type" means a designator to indicate which method of uniquely identifying a part has been used.

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format of Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) This Solicitation Number BBG50-Q-10-0013 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP), that will result in one or more contract awards (Blanket Purchase Agreements) for the installation; maintenance; and removal of various types of data cabling; fiber optic (including MTP); twisted-pair; coaxial data; audio; and video cables; and all other associated hardware on a routine and emergency basis via firm-fixed-price task orders to one or more qualified contractor(s). The BPA ordering period will be one year with four additional option years, which may be exercised by the Government.</p>
<p>(iii) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-42, effective June 16, 2010.<br /><br />(iv) The Contracting Officer has determined that there are at least two qualified small businesses capable of performing the work. Therefore, pursuant to FAR 19.502-2(b), this procurement is set-aside exclusively for small businesses. The NAICS code for this procurement is 238210(Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors) and size standard is $14.0 million.</p>
<p>(v) The Contractor shall provide the supplies and/or services described in each individual Task Order. Each Task Order will have its own unique SOW that will specify the work to be performed, the location or locations of the work, the schedule for completion of work, the deliverables, the acceptance criteria, and any special requirements. The Firm-Fixed-Price and Delivery Schedule for each Task Order will be negotiated and agreed to prior to commencement of work.</p>
<p>(vi) The CLIN required above is described as follows: CLIN No. 1: The Contractor shall install; maintain; and/or remove various types of data cabling; fiber optic (including MTP); twisted-pair; coaxial data; audio; and video cables; and all other associated hardware. The Contractor must be able to provide "Emergency" service, installation; relocation and/or repairs for items or services on an emergency basis as required by the Government. Contractor must respond within 2 to 4 hours after emergency notifications are received by the Contractor and/or at other response times as mutually agreed upon by the Contractor and the Government - including nights, weekends and/or holidays. The Government makes no guarantee as to the exact number of Task Orders or actual dollar amount of services that will be requested during the term of the contract. The annual estimated maximum amount of services anticipated for all of the Task Orders that will be awarded is less than $100,000.</p>
<p>(vii) All work shall be performed at BBG/IBB/VOA Headquarters located at 330 Independence Ave, SW [Cohen Building] or 330 "C" St, SW [Switzer Building] in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>(ix) The provision at FAR Subpart 52.212-2 [Evaluation of Commercial Items] is hereby incorporated by reference into this combined synopsis/solicitation. The below-stated technical evaluation subfactors, when combined, are more important than price in the BBG's overall evaluation of an Offeror's proposal. The Offeror's Technical Proposals will be evaluated in three equally-weighted areas (a) Offeror's understanding of the work, (b) Capability, i.e., personnel qualifications; and (c) Experience/ Past Performance. In order to help the Government in its evaluation of past performance, Offerors shall provide at least three (3) current references with valid telephone numbers of customers for similar services. Pricing data (e.g., hourly rates) shall be inclusive of overhead, G&amp;A, and profit.</p>
<p>(x) Offerors shall submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR Subpart 52.212-3 [Offeror representations and certifications -- commercial items] with their proposal. This provision can be found at the following website: http://www.arnet.gov/far/; if requested by an Offeror, a copy of FAR subpart 52.212-3 can be obtained by contacting the contracting officer.</p>
<p>(xi) FAR 52.212-4 [Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items] applies to this acquisition.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span>Historically, there has been an absence of adequate and appropriate shelter support and care for infants and children within shelters during disasters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Infant and Child Kit list has been developed by the National Commission on Children and Disasters with guidance from subject matter experts in emergency management and pediatric care. This document identifies, and requests for, basic supplies necessary to sustain and support infants and children, within a 100 person shelter based on shelter statistical data, up to 3 years of age for a 72 hour period within any given shelter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of shelter providers have offered limited to no direct assistance for infants and children within shelters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Currently, there is no contracting method for the Federal government to provide this type and level of support within the shelter community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Federal, state and local jurisdictions will provide caches of supplies to support the care of children in mass care shelters and emergency congregate care facilities for a minimum of 72 hours. The amount of supplies cached in an area should be based upon the potential number of children up to 3 years of age that could be populating the local shelters and facilities for a minimum of 72 hours, as determined by an assessment of current demographic data for the jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a level of preparedness is critical due to the high vulnerability of this population.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 24-72 hour supply of essential child-specific supplies should be on site prior to the opening of a shelter or facility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is requested as the primary acquisition method for procuring Infant and Toddler Shelter Kit Shelter Support Items. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Contractor shall provide Kit items for FEMA to purchase, as needed, based on requirements set forth by FEMA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>FEMA will not be warehousing these support items as they will be ordered on an as-need basis to support shelters with a general population of 100 persons in an affected jurisdiction.</p>

(End of Provision)

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.

All offerors shall provide a quotation for the following line item:

Line Item 0001: Schottky-type Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope

Background / Intended Usage

The Surface and Microanalysis Science Division of NISTs Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory has a requirement for a high brightness scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer(s) to use as a development platform for high throughput automated microscopy.  

The primary design goals for the finished system (vendor hardware plus hardware/software additions to be made by NIST) under standard operating conditions are:

	Find, size, and quantify (using the EDS) 10,000 particles per hour (~3 per second) on an optimal sample;
o	Since the measured spectral intensity depends upon both the particle composition and size, we specify that the probe current, acquisition duration and detector collection efficiency should be such that it would produce a 40,000 count spectrum (total counts) on bulk Cu.

	Reliably resolve particles down to 100 nm;

	The system must be sufficiently stable to perform unattended analyses of multiple samples under motorized stage control for periods greater than 24 hours;

	Capable of collecting position-tagged x-ray data;

The x-ray detection system shall have an output count rate exceeding 200,000 cps to meet the 10,000 particle per hour requirement.  In order to quantify the resulting spectra to the ~1% level, the (uncorrected) coincidence count rate should be small.

The probe current and x-ray detector solid angle must be sufficient to produce 200,000 x-rays per second output.  

The probe must be bright (high current at a small diameter) to reliably resolve and measure 100 nm particles while simultaneously being capable of producing 200,000 cps on bulk Cu.  


NISTs goal is to implement the particle search and measure based on dynamic beam control.  For these purposes, dynamic beam control is defined as the ability to 1) raster along arbitrarily oriented chords within the image plane; 2) make dynamic decisions to stop the raster based on measured pixel intensities; 3) dynamically adjust the interpixel distance to optimize speed and precision.  The purpose of the dynamic beam control is to implement the rotating chord algorithm  a highly optimized algorithm for fast particle search and precise particle sizing.

<DESC>The US Dept of Commerce NOAA / ESRL / PSD requires<br />a contractor to prepare a parking pad for a research<br />weather radar North of the end of Flightline Dr,<br />Lincoln, CA 95648.
<p>The exact location of the site is defined by orange<br />cones left by Clark King 2009-11-09. The cones were<br />present 2009-12-04.</p>
<p>There is an existing PG&amp;E underground electrical vault<br />about 350 ft North of the end of Flightline Dr that<br />provides a fixed reference to the site. The approximate<br />GPS coordinates of the vault are<br />38.91503 North, 121.34628 West.</p>
<p>The sides of the site are parrallel to and<br />perpendicular to the existing fence line East<br />of the vault. The fence has a heading of about<br />345 degrees true and is about 70 feet East of<br />the vault.<br />A 12 ft wide driveway about 290 feet long<br />is required. The existing cones that define<br />the driveway are only 10 feet wide and the<br />driveway needs to be 12 feet wide. The<br />driveway parrallels the fence from Flightline<br />Dr for 55 feet, then angles to the center of<br />the South side of the site. We need to be<br />able to get a semi-trailers and cranes to<br />the site.</p>
<p>The site and driveway is to be only slightly leveled<br />and vegitation scraped without digging into the ground<br />or removing much soil. The road base should then be<br />put down over the leveled surface. The scraped<br />material can be put just North of the site.</p>
<p>The site and driveway must also be surrounded hay<br />tubular pads to filter surface run-off.</p>
<p>There need to be three drainage pipes under the<br />driveway, 2 to 3 " diameter, to let any water<br />slowly drain under the driveway. One pipe needs<br />to be near the site, one near the middle of the<br />driveway, and one just North of the bend near<br />Flightline drive. Exact location is not critical.</p>
<p>The compacted road base must be 6 inches deep after<br />compacting. My rough estimate of yardage after<br />the compacting is done:<br />66 ft X 110 ft X 6 inches = 134.4 cubic yards<br />+ 12 ft X 290 ft X 6 inches = 64.4 cubic yards<br />------<br />about 200 cubic&nbsp;yards&nbsp;</p>

Seward is the southern terminus of the Alaska Railroad and is also connected to the Alaska Highway system. The City of Seward is built on the alluvial outwash plain formed by Lowell Creek which was diverted away from the community in 1940. The system consists of four features; a tunnel drilled through Bear Mountain, a diversion dam, an inlet, and an outlet. Since the original project construction, development of residential and commercial properties has occurred within the old floodway leading from the dam spillway at the tunnel entrance through Bear Mountain. Several events have caused damage to the tunnel including flood flows and landslides. The most recent event has damaged the fence located at the outlet of the tunnel. Excessive vegetation and debris is also threatening to further damage the fence.</span></span> <br />

The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted.

Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />&bull; Factor 1- Technical Capability (based on acceptability of FAA/equivalent certification).<br />&bull; Factor 2- Price<br />&bull; Factor 3- Delivery<br />&bull; Factor 4- Past Performance (based on reference checks and/or historical performance record(s).<br />Technical Capability is the most important evaluation factor. Price is the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery is the third most important evaluation factor. Past Performance is the least important evaluation factor. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision) <br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br /><br />1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance <br /><br />The basis of evaluation will be made in the order listed above. Technical capability is considered the most important factor and will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide genuine OEM parts or approved alternates. The Offeror of an alternate part must submit data that adequately demonstrates that its product meets or exceeds the requirements of the solicitation in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.246-15, Certificate of Conformance. A general statement of compliance or restatement of the requirements is insufficient. An offeror must clearly identify in writing they are providing an alternate part by annotating it on their quote. Offerors who are providing an alternate part shall include in their quote descriptive literature or description literatures such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference, such as a web site to information readily available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.Technical capability and Price, when combined, are more important than delivery and past performance.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).</p>
<p>(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Companies must have valid DUNS numbers and be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 26 July 2010, 4:30 p.m., EST.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

B.3  PERFORMANCE BASED STATEMENT OF WORK

Vendor shall conduct the following engineering tasks in support of the effort at the CIVR to create hermetically sealed, electrically functional retinal prostheses. The work shall be conducted primarily at vendor site, with ancillary machining, assembly, and/or testing at the VABHS and other area facilities as required.  The purpose of this work is to develop materials and methods for hermetic sealing of subretinal prosthesis assemblies that shall be provided by the CIVR, and to develop adequate fixturing for measuring the leak rate of helium and/or water into current and future generations of retinal prosthesis packages that the CIVR develops (and subsequent performance of such tests.)  The final goal is overmolding the sealed prosthesis assemblies with epoxy to keep water away from the signal feedthrough connections.
Objectives:
To optimize the process and document standard operating procedures for sealing CIVR-supplied platinum-coated titanium lids, water gettering devices and suture tab structures in or on to subretinal prosthesis assemblies (also be provided by the CIVR), leading to the mutual development of a formal procurement specification for future prosthesis assembly runs that are outside the scope of this contract.
To optimize the process and document standard operating procedures for overmolding hermetically sealed subretinal prosthesis assemblies (provided by the CIVR) with epoxy to keep water away from their signal feedthroughs, also leading to development of a formal procurement specification for future prosthesis assembly runs (outside the scope of this contract).
To design and fabricate test fixtures to evaluate helium and/or water leakage into current and future hermetically sealed subretinal prosthesis assemblies using available measurement technologies at Vendor and/or its subcontractors, and to perform and document these calibrated measurements.
To fabricate small engineering lots of both electrically inactive (dummy) engineering prototypes and complete, hermetically sealed and overmolded electrically active implants at the request of CIVR personnel, contingent upon component availability from the CIVR.
The tasks required to meet these objectives are the following. All testing will be conducted and documented in a manner appropriate for reporting in peer-reviewed scientific publications and for supporting the future regulatory needs of the CIVR, with the exception of any technologies or processes that are deemed confidential by Vendor, and whose status is made known to the CIVR by Vendor in writing.  Vendor shall provide access to records and standard procedures developed during the contract period to the CIVR team members during routine vendor audits.  The following tasks shall be performed on a best effort basis.

Task 1.	  Laser welding and hermetic sealing.
Employing proprietary know-how, Vendor shall develop engineering processes for laser welding of subretinal prosthesis assemblies and their external suture tab components so as to form hermetically sealed enclosures with CIVR-procured water gettering devices inside. Standard operating procedures shall be documented, leading to the creation of a formal procurement specification for future assembly runs.

Task 2.	  Overmolding.
Employing proprietary know-how, Vendor shall develop engineering processes for overmolding of completed subretinal prosthesis assemblies with epoxy to prevent water from infiltrating the signal feedthrough region. Standard operating procedures shall be documented, leading to the creation of a formal procurement specification for future assembly runs.

Task 3.	  Leak testing.
Vendor shall design and fabricate test fixtures to evaluate helium and/or water leakage into current and future CIVR hermetically sealed subretinal prosthesis assemblies or feedthrough modules using available measurement technologies at Vendor and/or its subcontractors, and Vendor shall perform and document calibrated measurements at the CIVRs request.

Task 4.  Engineering lot fabrication.
Vendor shall fabricate small engineering lots of both electrically inactive (dummy) engineering prototypes and complete, hermetically sealed and overmolded electrically active implants at the request of CIVR personnel, contingent upon component availability from the CIVR.

     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
 
   (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--

     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
 
     [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

		   AGGREGATE (BASE AND ALL OPTIONS) TOTAL:  $_____________
 
STATEMENT OF WORK

A.	The office of Research Oversight ORO serves as the primary Veterans Health Administration (VHA) office in advising the Under Secretary of Health on all matters of compliance and assurance regarding human subject protections, animal welfare, research safety and security, and research misconduct.  ORO has a public awareness initiative whereby the office makes known our mission, mandate, and methodologies to ensure research compliance in VA research and to instill public confidence in VHA research.  ORO is interested in ensuring that prompt reporting is made to ORO and that VA staff are aware of how they can receive assistance regarding compliance matters in VHA research.  ORO also reaches out to the wider research community and to Veterans and Veterans' organizations to address their concerns related to VHA research and to assure them that the agency has an independent gatekeeper with a highly developed methodology to monitor compliance.

B.	ORO maintains two basic types of displays, a large display and several tabletop displays for use at major meetings and Veteran conferences throughout the United States and Canada.  The displays explain about ORO's mission and organizational structure and provide information as to whom to contact about various compliance issues.  The large display is an accordion unit with prefabricated panels with assembly dimensions of approximately 10' x 10'.  For shipping, it is crated in two or three pieces and is of significant size and weight.  The tabletop display comes in a heavy large carrying case.  Typically, ORO staff attending the meetings where it is used take turns staffing the display booth during the meetings to answer questions and refer visitors to appropriate resources.  A table(s) is used in front of the booth to disseminate literature about ORO and research compliance.

C.	This display is used when ORO is present at such meetings where the public is present and needs to be educated about VA and the Office of Research Oversight.

The projected sites where the display might be displayed are as follows:

1.	Office for Human Research Protections Meeting
2.	American Association of Laboratory Animal Science
3.	Association of Military Surgeons of the United States
4.	Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research: Human Subjects 
5.	Office for Human Research Protections Meetings, Advancing Human Subjects Protections
6.	Public Responsibility in Medicine and Research: Animal Care and Use Meeting
7.	Other national meetings to be decided concerning research safety and security
8.	Society of Research Administrators
9.	Veteran Service Organizational Meetings

D.	Typically, the displays are kept in ORO's Central Office in Washington, DC, and shipped to various meeting sites where the displays will be exhibited.

The contractor will assist with ensuring that the display is shipped, arrives at its destination, and is set up, taken down, and shipped back to ORO properly.  The contractor, working in conjunction with representatives from ORO, will complete the exhibitor registration forms and other appropriate paperwork to ensure that furniture for the booths, carpet, lighting, and other accoutrements for the display are available on site as required.  The contractor will be responsible for the assembly and breakdown of the display since contracting with the convention site exhibition personnel to assist would increase costs significantly.

E.	On those occasions where the display has to be updated or repaired, the contractor would be responsible for coordinating the fabrication of new display material with concurrence of the designated ORO representative.

F.	The use of a contractor for the purposes specified will require that fewer ORO staff need to attend meetings to help assemble and break down the display, and fewer are required to staff the display booth during the meetings.  To meet our expected outcome, ORO requires the availability of a knowledgeable and personable contractor to be present at the booth to answer general questions about ORO's mission and to refer more detailed questions to the right ORO staff member when an ORO staff person cannot be present at the display.  The contractor will not address issues that warrant clarification of VHA policy, but will refer these issues to an authorized ORO staff member.

II.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK

A.	ORO will determine at which meetings the exhibit will be displayed and at which meetings contract services are needed.  The contract will be awarded for a base year and 4 option years.  ORO will request approximately 2 months to 6 weeks in advance that the contractor help with transportation, assembly, updating and general presence at the meetings where ORO is present to promote public awareness of its mission and functions.  The contractor would also be expected to assist with receiving and displaying other materials to be provided for the display.  ORO is proposing to pay for transportation to and from the Chicago area, per diem, and an hourly fee to the contractor.  ORO will separately pay the contractor any costs associated with the display including costs to repair or update the display, additional costs associated with repairs needed on site or rental of additional accoutrements on site.  If any repairs or maintenance to the display are required, it is preferred, if possible, that the contractor provides ORO with a list of material needed so ORO can do the purchasing.  ORO will also pay for the costs of transportation for the display and any related but unexpected charges as agreed to by the ORO designated representative.  

There will be no set number (minimum or maximum) guaranteed number of meetings per year where contractor services will be needed or requested.  ORO estimates that the contractor could be asked to assist with as many as five to eight meetings per year.

B.	Typically, the contractor might be expected to perform activities such as:

"	Completing exhibitor registration forms and other appropriate paperwork to ensure that furniture for the booths, carpet, lighting, and other accoutrements for the display are available on site as required.  The Contractor will coordinate with ORO personnel to obtain appropriate signatures.
"	Ensuring the display and handout materials are shipped or hand delivered to the meeting site.
"	Ensuring assembly of the display including assembling tables, chairs, lights, rugs, other items at the display site for the booth as arranged in advance by ORO staff.
"	Keeping the display materials readily available at the booth and keeping the area generally tidy and accessible.
"	Coordinating with ORO staff on schedules for ORO staff to be present at the display during the meeting.
"	Being present at the display booth during times when ORO staff cannot be present or during times when many will be visiting the booth.
"	Answering general questions about ORO's mission and function and referring specific questions requiring subject matter expertise to the qualified members of ORO.
"	Taking down the display.
"	Completing forms for shipping the display to the ORO Central Office or another location specified by ORO or ensuring hand delivery of the display from meeting site to another specified location.
"	Advising ORO of any repairs that must be made to the display and advising ORO staff on resources for those repairs.
"	Assisting ORO staff in making modifications of the display as directed by ORO using resources funded by the VA and with concurrence of ORO.
C.	The contractor shall provide a person who can:

"	Be strong enough to set up, disassemble the display, pack it up and transport it.

"	Knowledgeable about how to set up and disassemble the display.

"	Have a schedule flexible enough to generally accommodate a request from ORO 2 months to 6 weeks in advance fro assistance.

"	Be generally knowledgeable about ORO's mission and functions and organization to answer general questions from meeting attendees and to refer questions to appropriate ORO staff.

"	Be personable and willing to outreach to the public and work well with ORO staff.

"	Be able to coordinate with ORO staff by email and telephone concerning arrangements for shipping, display logistical arrangements of setting up the booth, staffing of the booth.

"	Occasionally come to the ORO Central Office to arrange moving the display or for updating or repair of the display at the direction of ORO staff in coordination with VA graphics or other resources.


D.	The contractor shall provide requested personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services related to Office of Research Oversight at public outreach and education site (s) in the United States to be specified by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Research Oversight.

<DESC>The VA Northern California Health Care System intends to negotiate a noncompetitive award with Vertical Product Development, a Small Business for continuation of an order to create a mobile software application for iPhone and iPod to support evidence-based psychotherapies for VA Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto CA. This procurement is a sole source award in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1. Sole source justification has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Sole source justification has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-42.  The NAICS code is 541511 and the small business size standard is $25 million. 

Scope of Work:

The contractor shall create a mobile software application for iPhone and iPod touch that will serve as an adjunct to evidence based psychotherapies that are currently being disseminated in the Department of Veterans Affairs. This application will be expandable to include more functionality and more interventions as these are desired.

A single application will be developed that includes the following five sub-applications:
 Are there really five sub-applications or just five as seen below  (please clarify)
"	Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
"	Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)
"	Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)
"	Prolonged Exposure (PE)
"	Psychological First Aid (PFA)

Each of these will be aimed at current VA patients and providers as an adjunct to care rather than a replacement for care. Applications are expected to share various components as possible and to have a single "look and feel." The specific elements of each of the sub-applications will be determined and crafted with collaboration between core team members, domain-specific subject matter experts, a content manager, and student contributors. 

Following development, these applications will be tested for efficacy and effectiveness for Veterans with PTSD who are currently patients within the VA system. This will require purchasing iPod touch devices.

Contractor will provide expertise and development including:

"	Software project management
"	Software development
"	User experience design
"	Media development (as needed)

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;&nbsp;quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote(RFQ)#NLRB-F0-246-06. This RFQ will result in the award of a Firm Fixed Price contract for flooring installation for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-42, effective June 16, 2010.</p>
<p><strong>1. Scope: <br /></strong>1.1 Objective. <br />The objective of this proposal is to procure a contractor's service to professionally install a new flooring (according to manufacturers installation techniques) after first removing and disposing of the current flooring in a manner stipulated by environmental regulation and law in the Aerobic Room of the Fitness Center which is located in the NLRB Headquarters Building, 1099 14th Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20570. The dimensions of the Aerobic Room are 47'x25'x6'.</p>
<p><strong>2. Tasks Including But Not Limited To: <br /></strong>The successful bidder shall at a minimum furnish all labor and materials to accomplish the following: <br />2.1 Remove existing strip flooring in the Aerobic Room (47'x25'x6') and dispose the removed material in an environmentally safe manner.<br />2.2 Supply and install six (6) mil plastic barriers.<br />2.3 Supply and install two (2) layers of plywood: <br />2.3(a) One layer 5/8" tongue and grooved and the other layer &frac12;" with 3/8" cushioned "thrust-a-pads" attached to the first layer to add bounce.<br />2.4 Supply 2-1/4" wide x &frac34;" thick oak flooring nailed directly on plywood. <br />2.5 Sand and finish with three (3) coats of water based urethane-satin finish.<br />2.6 Install new vent cove base on walls.<br />2.7 Install a new threshold at doors.<br /><strong>The MLRB may consider alternative technical proposals to achieve the same results.<br /></strong><br /><strong>3. Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR)</strong> <br />3.1 The COTR will be Michael Havas, Inventory Management Specialist, Property and Facilities Branch, National Labor Relations Board, telephone (202) 273-4040 and facsimile (202) 273-2849. The COTR has the responsibility for monitoring the performance of the contract. In no event is the COTR empowered to change any of the terms and conditions of the contract. The Contracting Officer (CO) is the only individual authorized to make changes to the contract, and will do so by properly executing necessary modifications.</p>
<p><strong>4. Period of Performance. <br /></strong>4.1 The period of performance will start the date of award and end in 90 calendar days at which time the requirement shall be completed. Work shall be performed Mondays through Fridays, during NLRB's regular business hours, 8:30am to 5:00pm</p>
<p><strong>5. Basis For Award: <br /></strong>The objective of the NLRB is to select the&nbsp;quote that represents the best value to the government while meeting or exceeding the flooring installation requirements covered in this solicitation.&nbsp; The award may be made based on the initial submission, with or without discussion, so contractors should submit&nbsp;quotes that clearly meet or exceed the requirements of the SOW. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the NLRB. To be eligible for an award, the contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration&nbsp;(CCR) database.&nbsp; The NLRB is a tax exempt Federal agency; please do not include any sales taxes in the price proposal for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p><strong>6. Evaluation Criteria: <br /></strong>The award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is evaluated as the best value to the Government based on&nbsp;the requirements stated in this solicitation.&nbsp;Award will be made to the offeror deemed the Lowest Price Technical Acceptable (LPTA) offer. The Government intends to evaluate&nbsp;quotes and make award without discussions; however, this does not preclude the Government from having discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government to do so.<br />In case of a receipt of a large number of quotes, the Contracting Officer will evaluate proposals in phases in order to progressively reduce the number of proposals being considered for contract award.<br />First, technical proposals will be evaluated using streamlined methods to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be as good as proposals remaining in the competition.<br />a. If a large number of offers still remain, price proposals will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are either unacceptable or are not considered to be valued as well as proposals remaining in the competition.<br />b. If a large number of offers still remain, past performance will be evaluated to eliminate those proposals that are not sufficiently competitive to be selected for award.<br />c. After the number of offers is reduced to a reasonable number, if needed, site visits and/or discussions will be conducted with those remaining in the competition.<br /><br />The decision to eliminate any offers through this contingency procedure does not constitute the establishment of a competitive range, and will not obligate the NLRB to conduct discussions or to solicit or entertain proposal revisions.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Quote Submission:</strong><br />Quotes are to provide the requested information in a brief and succinct manner, making every effort to present information clearly and concisely. Proposals should address the requirements of the project consistent with the evaluation criteria described in this solicitation. Lengthy narratives containing extraneous information are discouraged. All information shall be submitted in English.&nbsp;The Quote submission shall include a tecnical proposal and a price quote. The Technical proposal shall address all the salient points of this solicitation and provide confidence in the ability of the contractor&nbsp;to properly complete the&nbsp;instsallation of&nbsp;the Aerobic Room flooring.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Quotes are due by 4:00 p.m. EDT on July 16, 2010 </strong>via email to Douglas Wolf at doug.wolf@nlrb.gov or by regular mail.

<p>Statement of Work (SOW)</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced in August 2003 its intention to make its animal feed safety regulatory program more risk-based and comprehensive. The modernized Animal Feed Safety System (AFSS) will incorporate risk-based, preventive control measures for ensuring the safety of animal feed.</p>
<p>The work of the AFSS Team is guided by a Framework Document, first drafted in 2005, that identifies the current processes, guidance, regulations and policy documents that address feed safety and the documents that should be developed to make the Agency's feed safety program comprehensive and risk-based. The Framework Document has been revised three times and will undergo additional revisions as needed.</p>
<p>One of the gaps identified in the AFSS Framework Document is the need for a more comprehensive animal feed safety program in the United States. To address that gap, the AFSS Team has written process control regulations that cover receipt, manufacture and distribution of all animal feed, including pet food and feed ingredients. These proposed regulations are presently in Agency clearance.</p>
<p>Critical to each step in the process is the identification of potential feed hazards and the implementation of steps to ensure that the hazards are controlled so they do not present an unacceptable risk to animal or human health. The FDA plans to release guidance on feed hazard identification and control to assist manufacturers and transporters of animal feed to comply with this requirement and thereby ensure the safety of their feed products. One challenge in drafting the proposed rule is defining terms in a way that takes into account the fact that the presence of certain feed hazards in animal feed or the existence of certain conditions offered does not always pose a significant risk to animal or human health.</p>
<p>Duties</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide expert services to the Center for Veterinary Medicine <br />(CVM) for development of guidance for industry which explain how to identify feed <br />Hazards of concern and steps to control the presence offered hazards in feed products so <br />animal or human health is not compromised. Specifically, the Contractor will be responsible for the timely drafting of guidance documents and efficient revision of the <br />documents based on comments from the AFSS Team.</p>
<p>The Contractor should have extensive experience and knowledge regarding the presence offered hazards in animal feed and the measures the feed industry has at its disposal for handling such hazards. The Contractor needs to understand the principles of risk and relative risk assessment. Also, the Contractor needs wide-ranging knowledge of the regulatory and stakeholder groups that could be impacted by the guidance. Furthermore, the Contractor must have a working knowledge of the feed industry as it currently exists</p>
<p>and operates, as well as the goals, objectives and premises of the AFSS. The Contractor will need to be available to travel on occasion.</p>
<p>Location</p>
<p>The work will take place at the contractor's place of business and on occasion at CVM, 7519 Standish Place, Rockville, MD. <br />Equipment - Use No government funded nor extraordinary equipment is needed.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria <br />A. Experience and Capability of Contractor (60 points) Describe experience and capability to provide guidance services on feed hazard identification and control in animal feed manufacturing. <br />1. Describe ability to: <br />&bull; Identify common and occasional chemical and microbiological hazards in feed; <br />&bull; Develop written materials explaining control offered hazards at sites of feed manufacture, storage and distribution; <br />&bull; Translate regulatory requirements into materials useful to the feed industry in understanding what is required to be in compliance; and, <br />&bull; Communicate using written materials.</p>
<p>2. Describe expert knowledge of the animal feed industry and its regulation. The Contractor should have experience with: <br />&bull; Technical/Scientific factors relating to animal feed, especially in the areas of feed hazards, quality control, animal drugs, toxicology, and feed manufacturing; <br />&bull; Regulation of animal feeds, including the processes used by the FDA to ensure regulatory compliance; and, <br />&bull; Conducting research on animal feed hazards</p>
<p>B. Technical Approach (10 points) Describe the technical approach to be used for providing FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) with guidance materials that explain how feed establishments can have adequate plans for identification and control offered hazards.</p>
<p>C. Understanding the Scope of Work (20 points) <br />. Provide a comprehensive statement of the scope and purpose of the project to the intent and requirements. State the overall objectives and the specific accomplishments you hope to achieve. Indicate the rationale for your plan, and the relationship to comparable work in progress or completed elsewhere.</p>
<p>1. Knowledge and understanding of the Scope of Work is demonstrated by the clarity, practicality, and appropriateness of the contractor's proposal and plan to accomplish the effort.</p>
<p>2. Demonstrate recognition and ability to overcome potential difficulties in the performance of the project.</p>
<p><br />D. Past Performance (10 points) The contractor shall describe past performance, identifying other organizations with which he/she has participated in similar efforts including the degree of involvement, the size and complexity of the organization, and other information describing his/her experience. <br />Contractors shall submit a list of three (3) references. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of State and local governments, and commercial customers. Contractors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for all key personnel.

<p>6. Contracting officer and telephone number;</p>
<p>7. Program manager and telephone number; and</p>
<p>8. Administrative contracting officer, if different from number 6 above, and telephone number.</p>
<p>Each contractor will be evaluated on his/her performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used as an evaluation factor against which contractor's relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 3 to Solicitation Number N10PS18269
Due to the changes as stated below: the closing date is changed from 2:00pm Eastern Time on July 13, 2010 to 2:00pm Eastern Time on July 19, 2010. 

This amendment replaces in its entirety FAR Clause 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items.   (Jan 1999) with the revised version as stated below:
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items.   (Jan 1999)(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(i) Technical approach to meet the Government requirement;
(ii) Project Management (WBS Delivery Schedule and Qualtiy Control Plan);
(iii) Past performance (see FAR 15.304);
(iv) Price
The two (2) technical factors (i) and (ii) are of greatest importance, but are equal to each other.  The technical factors are more important than past performance and price. The past performance factor is more important than price.  As such, the technical factors and past performance factor in combination are more important than price.  Selection of the firm to perform this task order will be based on the Government's assessment of the best overall value. Technical quotes will be given adjective ratings. 
1.0 Technical Evaluation Factors (in descending order of importance):
Technical Approach:  The government will use the offeror's technical approach discussion (see Attachment 1, Proposal Instructions), the Government will evaluate the offeror's planned approach for reviewing the factors that RMA is considering including in the historical experience of the Actual Production History (APH) yields under the Federal Crop Insurance Program along with the originality of factors to examine with consideration made to RMA's current operating procedures.  The contractor's proposal should outline their plan to include the following crops in the analysis: wheat, cotton, corn, soybeans, grain sorghum, barley, rice, apples, and potatoes. Key Personnel will be evaluated based on the individual skills, education, the techniques the offeror will utilize to assess and quantify the risk associated with covering this topic specifically in anticipation of a limited data scenario, implementation feasibility, concerns, and experience of the key personnel proposed for this project.  

Project Management Plan (WBS, delivery schedule & Quality Control Plan):  
Proposals will be evaluated on the work breakdown structure, the proposed delivery schedule and the Contractor's Quality Control Plan. The government is looking for the Contractor that demonstrates the most effective, efficient and optimal technique to meet the solicitation's goals, objectives, and requirements.
Selection of the firm to perform this task order will be based on the Government's assessment of the best overall value. Technical quotes will be given adjective ratings.

Past Performance:  
The Government will evaluate the quality of previous work products the Offeror and its key personnel have produced on efforts similar to the size, scope and complexity of requirements within this statement of work and the organizations history of successful completion of projects; history of producing high-quality reports and other deliverables; history of staying on schedule and within budget.  The organization's specific experience working with clients in the business of developing crop insurance programs or similar programs.  Aspects to be considered include the customer's perspective on:
Usefulness and value of the services and products delivered (e.g., recommendations in previous work products were generally adopted);
The key objectives and initial intent of the contracts were met (customer expectations);
Previous work products contained relatively few substantial deficiencies; and the requested corrections were quickly and correctly made or satisfactorily explained; and
Previous work products contained detailed, logical, and insightful analysis and recommendation, use of appropriate statistical methods, insight into potential program vulnerabilities, etc.

This amendment reflects changes located on page 45 of the Solicitation to read as shown below:
Section 2.3 specifically paragraph 6 is changed to the following, [changes as noted within the brackets]:
However, the investigation need not be limited to these variables or approaches.  Additional variables or approaches may be presented in the proposal for consideration. [The contractors report shall include the following crops: wheat, cotton, corn, soybeans, grain sorghum, barley, rice, apples, and potatoes.]

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quote which shall be considered by the agency. Any amendment and documents related to this procurement will be available electronically at the Internet site: http://www.fbo.gov. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the documents related to this procurement, if any.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of offers is July 12, 2010 at 3:00 P.M., EST. Anticipated award date is on or about July 14, 2010. Contact Renee Wood at Renee.L.Wood@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation.

<DESC>TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
In the RFP the Government indicates that the contractor will "maintain the Air Force Toolbox of future weapons systems and capability descriptions for use in these games to include testing the existing database to determine the extent and scope of the problems with the Toolbox."Question 1.  Are there currently problems with the Tool Box's operation, performance and/or technologies (database)? If so what are they?Answer 1. The toolbox is difficult to update.  There are less than 1,000 entries in various states of currency. The Tool Box requires a special script run by administrators due to software updates to server.  The current Toolkits don't run correctly
Question 2.  When was the last time the Tool Box was tested and what were the results?Answer 2. The Tool Box has not been tested.  Only band aid repair has been accomplished.  
In the RFP the Government indicates that the contractor will be responsible for "updating the system [Tool Box] to ensure compatibility with Air Force relational database management systems and servers"Question 3.   Is the Tool Box currently incompatible with AF RDBMS and servers? If, so in what way?Answer 3. The Tool Box is currently incompatible due to software changes.  Only administrators have authority to run scripts.  These scripts are often hit or miss.  Software is cold-fusion and an oracle database.
Question 4.  What version(s) of information technology are the Tool Box's component parts developed from?Answer 4. Oracle relational database running on a cold-fusion backbone server.  Access is web-based.  
In the RFP the Government indicates the contractor will provide "training to database users and providing technical documentation and additional training to allow AF/A8XC to assume control and maintenance of database upon completion of task" Question 5.  What type of database is the Tool Box? Answer 5: Oracle relational database running on a cold-fusion backbone server.  Access is web-based.  
Question 6.  Approximately how many users will be trained and when?Answer 6. Not more than two should receive training.  Training should be made available within 2-3 months of contract award. It is preferred to have the vendor develop a step-by-step user guide for both administers and users.
Question 77.  Does "assume control and maintenance" mean that the contractor will train the Government to technically maintain the database? to maintain the data within? or both? Answer 7. It is intended that the contractor will maintain the integrity of the program to run correctly during the contract period.  Routine maintenance should be done quarterly to update the database as information becomes dated. 
In the RFP the Government indicates that contractor efforts will generate the cause and the extent of Tool Box errors, "resulting in the modification of the current application or in the development of a replacement system"Question 8.  Is the modification of the current Tool Box database system within the scope of this effort?Answer 8. It will be up to the contractor to determine to extent of errors and correct them, and subsequently maintain the integrity of the program and perform quarterly updates and maintenance.  The contractor should be ready to present options to the government of courses of action to repair the system and maintain health during the contracted period.
Question 9. If required, is the replacement of the Tool Box within the scope of this effort?Answer 9: Replacement is within the scope of this effort. 
Question 10.   What skill sets and numbers of personnel (by skill set) currently support the Tool Box?Answer 10: A GS-12 position is dedicated to support day-to-day operations of the toolbox. 
Statement of Work Paragraph 4.1, page II-2 and 6, page II-8Question 11.  Do the workshops and seminars require discussion of classified data?Answer 11: Yes, the workshops often require discussion of classified data. The information in the database is currently unclassified and access is via unclassified.  The Government normally request users to have a .mil address.
Section II, Page 6 refers to the CIPL and EA databases.  Question 12.  Would the government please provide explanations of these databases?Answer 12.  The Combatant Commander Integrated Priority List (IPL) database is the AF's assessment of program support to the IPLs.  The database is updated annually and includes COCOM IPL capability gaps, and support ratings/rationale and program support for each IPL.  The database is used to inform program deliberations and advocate the AF program.  Executive Agent (EA) database lists the information for all the AF's DoD Executive Agent designations.  The database is used for reference and to provide the data behind the abstracts for the AF's EA responsibilities on the OSD EA website.  
Question 13.  Does CIPL stand for COCOM Integrated Priorities List and does EA stand for Executive Agent database?  Answer 13. Yes
Section II, page 9 states the contractor shall "ensure full functionality of all user and administrative tools present prior to the award of this contract."  Question 14: Does the Government require Offerors to perform work prior to contract award? If not, what does this mean?Answer 14:  Contract award must occur first, and full functionality of all user and administrative tools would follow.  It is important for offerers to state when functionally is projected to occur.  The toolkit must be fully functional NLT 1 Nov 2010.  
Question 15. Is there an estimate of the percentage of work that will be on-site (in an A8 office) vs off-site (contractor facility)?Answer 15: This is dependent on the task order requirements.
Section 1 - Page 2 of RFP indicates "Significant experience with Application Design, Planning, Integration, Operations and Support" required. Question 16.  Does the work involve designing, planning, and integrating Applications?Answer 16: With regard to the AF Toolbox, designing and planning are envisioned as a part to improve the performance of the Toolbox.  
Section 1 - Page 2 of RFP indicates "Significant experience with Large Volume, High Transaction, Complex Systems". Question 17.  Which Complex Systems are referred here?Answer 17: There are many systems that may need to be addressed at the Task Order level.  The contractor must show experience in complex systems.  
Question 18: Will the customer provide the IT system required to support the Futures Capabilities Game events or will this contract award include the design and procurement of the IT system?Answer 18. The government retains the option to place task orders requesting IT support for the futures game.  Procurement of an IT system is not envisioned.
Question 19.  What is the current database architecture of the Air Force toolbox?Answer 19:  The toolbox database resides on a cold-fusion server containing less than 15M of active data.  Back-up services are essential.  There is archive and other data available summing to less than 100M but expandable to 500M.  It is available to users via a web-based application.  
Question 20.  I do not see any technical attributes like SharePoint or MS Surface?Answer 20: This would be based on the Contractor's technical approach to the task order statement of work provided. 
Section II 4.1 paragraph for it states that the working groups are to be created and managed by the contractor, however the location is not mentioned. Question 21.  Do the sessions travel or are they at a fixed location.Answer 21: Yes, there is travel involved with the various locations in CONUS.  
Question 22.   If they are at a fixed location then is this a contractor supplied or government supplied location?Answer 22: . Facilities are a mix of contractor and government provided.  Each will be determined at the task order level. 
5.3 Paragraph 4 states that contractor will provide press releases (applicable to A8PS).Question 23:   Are these briefings also require a lecture or meeting to the members?Answer 23: This will be determined at the task order level.   
Question 24:   Please clarify the requirement regarding "facility clearances" within the solicitation document.Answer 24:  Facility clearances will be determined at the task order level dependent on the requirements of the Statement of Work.   
Question 25.  Is the Air Force sponsoring SCIFs for this program? Answer 25: This will be determined at the task order level. Question 26:  Are potential offerors required to maintain a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility? If so, will the government offer sponsorship for SCIF accreditation and other clearance processes required under this program?Answer 26: This will be determined at the task order level.  
Section II, page 5 refers to A8PL. The May 2010 organization chart for A8 does not show A8PL.Question 27:   Is this a new division or a disbanded division? Answer 27: A8PL was disbanded.  However, A8PB (a brand new division in A8) subsumes most of the responsibilities and A8PE consumes the rest.
Question 28:  Would the Government please provide further explanation of A8PL and how it should be addressed in the RFP? Answer 28: A8PL is now disbanded.  A8PB now takes these responsibilities (per II-5):- [A8PB] "Produces timely and efficient quantitative and qualitative analysis of AF programs, resources, and capabilities using government-owned IT and web based tools. [A8PB] performs technical analysis to ensure that all aerospace vehicle disposition and migration plans and associated actions are accomplished." - [A8PB] "is responsible for ensuring all Force Activity Designator (FAD) and associated actions are accomplished and technical and analytical support to ensure maintenance of the classified CIPL database." - [A8PE] ensures maintenance of the USAF EA database by providing support to the AF EA corporate review process and preparing an AF EA analysis report.  Ensure all Program Change Requests (PCRs) and associated actions are accomplished.Additional RFP-related items are: A8PB develops and maintains all databases and tools for AF/A8P.  These tools are Basing Action Request Tracker, Aircraft Disposition Website, COCOM IPL website, Executive Agent website, Force Structure Announcement generator, Weapon System Roadmap generator, Corporate Structure Suite, and other applications.
Section 5.2 (Page II-5) references AF/A8PL - Combat Support and Analysis Division.  It is our understanding that this division is now A8PB - Strategic Basing Decision and includes responsibilities not included in the description on Page II-5.Question 29.  Does the Government want a response to the section as written or can they provide a clarification focused on responding to the A8PB division's increased range of responsibility?AF/A8PB is a division that falls under AF/A8P. AF/A8PB, Strategic Basing Division: The Strategic Basing Division provides AF senior leadership with a strategic basing process that is defendable, repeatable and transparent.  It supports SAF/IEI on all congressional basing inquiries, serves as SB-ESG secretariat, ensures all TFI and BRAC events are coordinated and synchronized, generates basing decision memoranda, provides policy and guidance, develops and maintains all databases and tools for AF/A8P, develops Weapon System Roadmaps, and assist Force Structure Announcement development.  Additionally, it acts as the AF single point for all basing and hosts and facilitates Basing Request Review Panel. A8PB develops and maintains all databases and tools for AF/A8P.

<DESC>Contractual Questions1.  Please confirm that the 40 page limit reference for the technical proposal on Page 2 of the RFP applies only to Volume I - Technical.  The 40 page limit only refers to Volume I - Technical
2.  Please confirm there are no page limits for Volumes II, III, and IV of the response.  Confirmed
3.  Is each of the four volumes for the response to be submitted as a separate document? Yes
Can the Government clarify their expectation for section 6 of the SOW (begins Page II-6)?  Section 6 repeats much of the content and appears to cover the same general scope as Section 4.1 but with significantly greater detail.  Additionally, Section 6 appears to focus on specific requirements for the current Futures Game vice more general requirements. 4.   Is Section 6 intended to be an initial or sample task order?  No section 6 is not an initial task order.  If so, there are no response instructions for preparing a technical or price quote for an initial or sample task.  Can the Government clarify their expectations for Section 6 and if a sample task is not intended, would the Government consider removing Section 6 from the SOW? No section 6 will not be removed.  Please define your technical capabilities for sections of the SOW.
5.  Is this a new requirement or if there is an incumbent?  Yes, this is a new requirement.
 6.  Please clarify the correct solicitation number. Correct solicitation number is N10PS18256
RFP Section M.3.4 Factor 4: Staffing states in part: "The Offeror's Labor Category Table will be evaluated to determine the consistency and reasonableness of the proposed labor category qualifications with the Government's labor category descriptions."  7.  Does the government intend to provide proposers its labor category descriptions, and if so, when?  No this has removed from the solicitation.  8.  How is the government going to evaluate fair and reasonableness of submitted labor rates? In accordance with FAR 15.4049.   How is the government going to evaluate cost (as part of the best value determination) on a fair and consistent basis between solicitation responses?  It is based on the offerors technical solution.  10. Once the contract vehicle is awarded, when does the Government expect the first task order to be issued (timing)?  As soon as practicable 
11.  For the Subcontracting Plan, are the percentage goals additive; i.e., if an offeror chooses to meet the Small Business goal of 10% and the Small Disadvantaged goal of 2% (assuming only 2 of 5 goals must be met), is the total goal 12% or 10% given that Small Disadvantaged is a subset of Small Business? No they are not additive 
12: How will the Government evaluate two offeror submissions with different percentage goals (e.g., 3% total to small businesses of all types, vs. 10%)?  Will two such proposals be considered equally acceptable?  Each offeror must meet at a minimum two of the five subcontracting goals. 
Under Factor 2 Evaluation instructions in Section I, pp. 5-6, in the following paragraph:  "Provides appropriate examples where the Offeror integrates partners and subcontractors into partner or subcontractor, and how roles and responsibilities are to be assigned, coordinated, managed, and implemented."  It appears that either something was unintentionally inserted or left out in this paragraph.  13.   Can the Government re-state this evaluation paragraph? Re-stated as follows"Provides appropriate examples where the Offeror integrates partners and subcontractors, and how roles and responsibilities are to be assigned, coordinated, managed, and implemented."


On Solicitation pp. III&IV, 4-5, the certification requirements are described regarding possible Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI), including both cases where offerors are aware and not aware of a possible OCI.  However, there is no indication in the solicitation of how this information will be evaluated.  Given current guidance from the Air Force and OSD that some conflicts cannot be mitigated (see SAF/AQC memorandum dated Nov 3, 2009, attached) , and GAO rulings supporting this point; and given FAR 9.504 "Contracting Officer Responsibilities," requiring that "contracting officers shall (1) Identify and evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest as early in the acquisition process as possible; and (2) Avoid, neutralize, or mitigate significant potential conflicts before contract award", 14. How does the government propose to evaluate OCI issues and disqualify conflicted offerors from receiving an award?  If there is an apparent OCI please submit a mitigation plan. 
Section II, Statement of Work, pages II-1 through II-13	15.  Would the Government accept proposals for a portion of the tasks or must Offerors address all tasks in the Statement of Work? All tasks must be addressed.
Section II, Statement of Work, Paragraphs 4, 5, & 6, pages II-2 through II-10	16.  The Statement of Work provides a substantial number of detailed subtasks that would be extremely difficult to address individually in a forty page technical volume.  May offerors provide a technical approach to types and groupings of tasks that would demonstrate its capabilities to address A8's requirements? Yes
	17.  SF1449 states 12:00am and page I-1 states 3pm.  Would the Government please clarify the due time for proposals? 3:00pm Eastern Time
	18.  Would the Government please clarify "Microsoft compatible format"?  Is that Microsoft operating system compatible or Microsoft Office compatible?  Microsoft Office compatible.
	19.  May offerors propose pricing based on GSA Schedules (e.g., MOBIS)?  Yes, but the terms and conditions of the IDIQ is what is to be conformed to.
Section I - Page 2 provides exclusions from the page limit.20.   Will the Government exclude the Conflict of Interest Certification/Disclosure, Completed 52.227-15, glossaries of acronyms and abbreviations, and cross reference matrices from the page count?  Yes 21.  What is the projected award date or award time frame?  Prior to September 30, 2010.
22.   Following award, what is the anticipated start date for specific task orders?  Do you expect to award tasks this FY?  As soon as practicable.  
23. Will the government also access the CPARs database for past performance?  Please refer to section I page 6.  
24. Does the government anticipate a continuous level of effort resulting from the award of each task order (i.e. on-site support services), or will the work be more short-term (i.e. off-site, product deliverables)? This is task order dependant.  
25. Besides the requirement for a Subcontracting Plan, do offerors have to list all planned subcontractors in the original proposal, or can the selection of subcontractors be deferred until future proposals on individual task orders?  Subcontractors must be addressed in the proposal.  
26.   Will there be any government approval process to add subcontractors after award? A formal modification to the contract will be issued.  
27.  Can we get clarification as to whether Page 3 or Page 6 is correct?  Page 3, Section I, says "three out of five," and Page 6, states "two out of five" as it relates to subcontracting goals. Two out of five subcontracting goals must be addressed.  
28.  Would the government provide an estimated breakdown of the level of effort for the tasks outlined-Administrative Support, Strategic Analysis, IT Support? Task order dependant.  
Section II - Page 10 of RFP mentions "The program manager will make a copy of the fully executed form available to the COR upon request. Obtain, store, maintain, and reproduce the required studies, reports, applicable staff documents, plan, etc. (up to the TOP SECRET classification level)."29.   Is a SCIF requirement for the prime, or can a sub-contractor firm provide the SCIF?  Task order dependant.   30.  What is the expected annual value of the resultant award(s)? The total IDIQ value is not anticipated to exceed $25million.
31.  Can a company propose only on a portion/section requirement of the RFP? All tasks must be proposed.  
32.  Will companies be required to submit a proposal for all individual task orders after winning an award?  It's the business decision of each Contractor to submit a proposal.  
In Section I-2 of the Solicitation under the instructions pertaining to the Technical Proposal Format, the Government states "Resumes of Key Personnel" shall be included in the offeror's response.  In Section III&IV-3 the Government further states that "for the purpose of the overall performance of this effort, the Contractor's Project Manager shall be designated as a key person." The Government does not identify any additional Contractor positions that are to be designated as Key Personnel under the IDIQ contract.33.   Based on this is it assumed that the Government will define all additional Key Personnel at the Task Order level.  Yes
The statement in Section I-2 seems to insinuate that the Government anticipates that the Contractor will submit more than one resume in response to the Solicitation.34.   If more than one resume is anticipated, then will the Government please state the additional position(s) that the Contractor is expected to provides resumes for in response to the Solicitation? Task order dependant.  
35.  Would the Government please advise whether the support that the winning bidders will provide under a resultant IDIQ contract is considered new work? Yes this is new work.  
The bidder recognizes that individual Task Orders issued under the IDIQ contract may be Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Time and Material (T&M) or other.  The bidder also understands that Task Orders issued may require Government site and/or contractor site work locations.  As an IDIQ pricing schema, the bidder intends to list each A8 appropriate labor category followed by two fully loaded rates; one which will apply for Government site work and another which will apply for contractor site work.  It is assumed that all work accomplished under this IDIQ contract will be done within the Washington Capitol Region. 36.  Please advise if it is the Government intention for the contractor to provide Government site and Contractor site rates for all proposed labor categories. Further-please confirm that the Government anticipates that all work under the resultant IDIQ contract will be accomplished within the Washington Capitol Region.  Yes the Govt. intent is for both on and off site.  All work will be accomplished in the Washington Capital Region. 
37.  If  performance locations in addition to those within the Washington Capitol Region are anticipated, does the Government anticipate that any of these additional locations will be OCONUS?  If so-would the Government please specify any such locations? No. All work will be accomplished in the Washington Capital Region. 
38.  If performance locations in addition to those within the Washington Capitol Region are anticipated, does the Government anticipate that these additional locations will include in any Gross Receipt Tax states under the resultant IDIQ contract? This includes work in New Mexico, Ohio, Arizona, Hawaii, Washington, and Delaware. Please advise.  All work will be accomplished in the Washington Capital Region. 
Section II, page 11 (Task 7): "The Contractor shall schedule a monthly consolidated Program management Review (PMR) that summarizes the results of all information required in the monthly progress reports to include work performed, the type and amount of effort (man-hours), expenses incurred, deliverables completed, work in progress, percentage of annual effort expended by effort, problems encountered, recommended solutions, and work planned during the next reporting period. The required reporting period will be on a calendar month basis regardless of the contractor's account period. The contractor shall provide copies of all required PMR reports to all attendees."39.  Is this requirement expected to be completed at the BPA level or task order level? This solicitation if for an IDIQ.  40.  Can a single offeror submit a proposal as a prime offeror and also compete as a member of another offeror's team and/or sub-contracting plan? Yes
There appears to be a sentence missing in RFP Section 4.3, Page II-3. The statement begins by noting that the "contractor will be expected to perform the following tasks: Provide analyses of to support the development of the Air Force's future Planning[.]" 41.  Can the government clarify what product or process is being referenced in this statement? Remove the word "of".  
42.  AQD is conducting this acquisition using the procedures as identified in FAR Part 12.  Therefore we respectfully request that FAR 52.244-2 be removed from Section I - Page 3, Volume IV- price/cost proposal and Section III & IV - 9, "FAR Clauses Incorporated By Reference" as this clause is not applicable to orders for commercial items. FAR 12 provides the policies and guidance in conjunction with the appropriate FAR part.  In addition to FAR 12, the guidance in FAR 15 is being utilized.  The clause will remain in the IDIQ.
43.   In Section 1 in the Format for Proposal paragraphs on Page 2 the page size, margins and font requirements are provided.  It does not provide a line spacing requirement.  Is there a specific line spacing requirement for the Technical Proposal? Single or double spaced.

The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization o the wastewater collection system for the Truax Field Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at the Dane County Regional Airport (IAP), to the City of Madison.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. The City (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: Truax Field is located at the Dane County Regional Airport, just on the northeast side of Madison, WI.  Truax Field is approximately 130 acres in size and has 59 buildings with a square foot total of approximately 750,000. The weekday workforce is approximately 350 persons and increases to about 1000 persons on a Unit Training Assembly weekend. The wastewater collection system consists of approximately 5100 linear feet of PVC pipe, 2700 linear feet of transite pipe; and 7400 linear feet of vitrified clay pipe, without tracer wire or warning tape and pipe diameters range in size from two to ten inches. There are 26 brick manholes ranging in depth from four to ten feet, 11 pre-cast manholes ranging in depth from four to six feet, five wastewater pumps from one to five horsepower and five lift stations. Truaxs wastewater collection system was originally installed in 1942.  It contains two lift stations and one 3-inch forced main at lift station #2.  Age of the system components ranges from 1942 to present, with (approximately) 35% being over 50 years old. The system consists of approximately 7700 linear feet of active piping ranging between 3 to 8 inches. The types of pipe include PVC, vitrified clay, concrete, and cast iron.  There are 30 manholes, the majority of which are pre-cast concrete and the remaining are brick. The two lift stations are in-ground packages installed in 1982 and 1994 with automatic controls incorporating audible/visual local alarms. There are three pumps; two are 3-hp and the other is 2-hp with rated flows of 175 gpm and 50 gpm respectively.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2000. No offers were received. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC><p><strong>THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING ADVERTISED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.<br /></strong><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking a qualified contractor to establish a Quality Management System (QMS) across the funded activities of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program, with the goal of identifying non-conforming data in a timely fashion to ensure data released to the public is of the highest quality possible. TCGA is a comprehensive, collaborative effort led by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to map the genomic changes that occur in major types and subtypes of cancer. Researchers throughout the nation are using various genome analysis technologies, including high through-put DNA sequencing, to carry out this effort. A pilot project initiated in 2006, focused on three tumor types (brain, ovarian, and lung), established the scientific infrastructure and demonstrated the "proof of concept" needed to mount a large-scale cancer genome mapping project. Based on the success of the pilot, TCGA announced in September 2009 that it will map the genomes of at least 20 additional cancers over the next five years. To facilitate expansion of the program, TCGA will focus on quality as a best management practice, and is seeking a qualified Contractor to define and implement a QMS. These services will include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall establish TCGA-Quality Management (QM) policies, processes and procedures in line with the program organization goals, implement the QMS, and train the staff within the Biospecimen Core Resources (BCR) and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). In addition, the Contractor shall provide a means to identify, track and report non-conforming data, establish and implement internal audit policies, processes, and methods to verify compliance with the QMS, and provide regular and detailed reports of the status of data quality at all stages in the TCGA workflow.</p>
<p>Key to the program will be the establishment of a process and system to ensure data completeness and quality. The Contractor shall establish a QMS congruent with the guidelines described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document HS1-A2, "A Quality Management System Model for Healthcare; Approved Guideline - Second Edition" (http://www.clsi.org/source/orders/index.cfm?section=Online_Store&amp;task=3&amp;CATEGORY=QM&amp;PRODUCT_TYPE=SALES&amp;SKU=HS01A2E). CLSI document HS1-A2 proposes Quality Management guidelines for organizations in the medical disciplines and these guidelines are based on a common set of 12 quality elements established by ISO 9001, typically referred to as Quality System Essentials (QSE). It is the intent of the TCGA Program Office to employ a minimal QMS based on 9 of the 12 QSEs. The Contractor shall define the quality policies, processes and procedures around these nine (9) QSEs as they relate to the TCGA program. The QSEs are (1) Documents and Records, (2) Organization, (3) Equipment, (4) Purchasing and Inventory, (5) Process Controls, (6) Information Management, (7) Occurrence Management, (8) Assessments, and (9) Customer Service. To overcome the late stage identification of non-conforming data, the Contractor shall provide a QMS that has the ability to implement a variety of workflow throughput measures and data quality checks across the BCR biospecimen repository, the clinical meta-data repository, and the data coordinating center. To support the regular data quality checks, the Contractor shall implement a QMS that, at a minimum, will provide the means to identify, manage, and track both throughput of samples and available data (including non-conforming data). Ideally, the QMS information management system (IMS) shall also support automated functions to reach into the various TCGA data repositories, perform a pre-defined list of data quality checks, capture the tests that passed and failed, and generate a summary report.</p>
<p>Request for Proposal (RFP) N02-CO-07030-36 will be available on or about June 10, 2010, and receipt for proposals will be due on or about 2:00 p.m., Eastern Prevailing Time on July 12, 2010.

The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and the National Institute of Environmental and Health Sciences (NIEHS) require the services of a contractor to establish, ...................."

The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and the National Institute of Environmental and Health Sciences (NIEHS) require the services of a contractor to establish, curate, and maintain an authoritative science driven nanomaterial registry, whose primary function is to provide consistent and authoritative minimal information about nanomaterials (MIAN) on the biological and environmental interactions of well-characterized nanomaterials, as well as links to associated publications, modeling tools, computational results and manufacturing guidances.  It will provide a curated data source and assessment information on the health and environmental effects of well-characterized nanomaterials.  A set of minimal information about nanomaterials, ontology, and standards will be developed through a community effort with broad representation to establish the authoritativeness of the registry.  Data evaluation criteria, the curation process, and the level of compliance will be established based on the MIAN, ontology, and standards to guide the curation and evaluate the data collected in the registry.  

The authoritativeness of this registry will be based upon community consensus and a quality compliance system. The MIAN and the Ontology must be developed with broad-based community consensus from the major nanomaterial, environmental, biomedical and regulatory stakeholders in academic, industry, and government agencies, and must incorporate the state-of-the-science and all applicable standards.

Specific services required under this contract include: demonstrated research experience, publication, and understanding of the importance of characterization parameters on nanomaterial-biological interactions and determining the capacity of biological assessment platforms to provide knowledge on the biological activity and toxic potential of nanomaterials; design, develop, maintain, operate, and upgrade a web-based nanomaterial registry; curate minimal information about nanomaterials for biological applications from existing databases; provide a single, authoritative source that links evaluated data for a particular nanomaterial or class of nanomaterials, from existing public databases; facilitate the efficient search, query, and reporting of the data; make it easy to compare physicochemical data, biological function, environmental fate, in vivo characterization information, and safety and toxicology data, etc. across different laboratories and data sources; facilitate the translation of new nanomaterials for biomedical and environmental applications; facilitate the development of new models, standards, assays and manufacturing methods; and provide a forum to engage the community in promoting standards, consistent information, and reliable information for regulatory decisions
The intended users of the registry are researchers who develop, characterize or utilize nanomaterials for biological, medical and environmental applications. The established nanomaterial registry will benefit users by providing a mechanism to find all types of data and information about a particular nanomaterial of interest. The nanomaterial registry shall provide a mechanism to allow interoperability among databases.

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement contract award will be made for a period of three years with three option years beginning on or about November 30, 2009. The solicitation will be made available electronically on or about August 26, 2009 and may be accessed through the Internet at the following address:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov .  Proposals will be due on or about September 28, 2009. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be may be issued by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>The Purpose of this Addition to the Description of the Mill Creek Project is to Post by answering a Couple of questions raised that were not Covered in the Specs.
This DOES NOT CHANGE the Sealed Bid Closing Date which Stays the same as:
 July 16, 2010 at 11:00am.
The Following are Questions with Answers:
 1.  What is to be done with tree stumps?  Answer: At the pre-bid, it was determined that the stumps be hauled or burnt at the contractors discretion.
                                
2.  Specs call for 2RC on Site 19, but not for Site 17.  Is this correct?  Answer: Yes,  according to illustration 5 on sheet 4 (drawing for Site #19) 8 inches of 2RC is required., and illustration  4 on sheet 2 ((drawing for Site #17) 8 inches of native granular material (not defined) is required.  In the pre-bid it was discussed that 2RC, which is equivalent to PennDOT 2A, may not be adequate in certain areas where the soil is saturated and the predominant soil type is a silty material.

3.  Shall both access roads have geo-textile?  Answer: No!  Specifications call for 2RC aggregate with AASHTO #1 at the entrances.  Geotextile was listed only at the entrances beneath the AASHTO #1.  
 
4.  Are all concrete structures (except weir) to be 6 inches thick? Answer:  No, thicknesses will depend on the span, internal pressures, and the casting procedures (in-place vs. precast).
 
5.  What size of 60% CaC03 is needed in the AeLB Pond?  Answer: AASHTO #3 (2.5 to 0.5) page 1000-2 in Technical Specifications.  Although illustration 3 of Sheet 4 lists TS 1008 as the reference document, it is actually TS1002.

These Questions and Answers DO NOT Change the Sealed Bid Opening date. The Sealed Bid
Opening Date remains the same which is: July 16, 2010 at 11:00am.

Please provide any supporting information in this regard.<BR><BR>*Please refer to National Industrial Security Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M, 28 February 2006) for further information.<BR><BR>5)   The government's intent is to provide/disclose all available software and documentation that supports the current JLCCTC model's baselines in the RFP. The government understands that there may be gaps/voids (i.e., conversion of software to a more open architecture) which are minor in nature when considering the JLCCTC system of systems. The government's intent is for the contractor to find solutions that will bridge/fill such gaps, both in software and documentation, with minimal impact on development schedules.  What would you suggest/recommend as an approach to overcome these kinds of gaps/voids?  Please provide any supporting information in this regard.<BR>

<DESC><p>This 02 July 2010 update is to provide the following:</p>
<p>1. Revised OCI language. When submission of a Mitigation Plan is necessary due to a potential, perceived or actual OCI; early submission of the plan is encouraged as the Offeror must have an acceptable and Government approved Mitigation Plan established prior to contract award. The Prime Contractor is responsible for submitting a Mitigation Plan when a potential, perceived or actual OCI exists with a subcontractor, teaming partner; etc.</p>
<p>a. Section H, Paragraph H.28 is revised to reflect the following:</p>

<p>"L8.7.4.5 Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Mitigation Plan. (Reference Draft RFP HC1028-10-R-2000, Section H, Paragraph H.28. The Government requires the work product provided by the GSM-O Contractor be uninfluenced by suggestions that the work product(s) from other GSM contracts/task orders (i.e., GSM-ETI and/or GSM-P&amp;S) or other DISA contracts unfairly benefited the non-GSM-O vendor. To prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might bias the GSM-O Contractor's judgement and/or prevent an unfair competitive advantage, the Government's preference is that the Offeror will not enter into business arrangements with any contractor awarded work on the GSM ETI, GSM-P&amp;S contracts and/or other DISA contracts. In the event that the Offeror determines it is necessary to enter into a business arrangement that that could be perceived as a potential or actual conflict of interest, the Offeror shall submit an OCI Mitigation Plan describing how the potential OCI will be avoided, neutralized or mitigated based on the general rules of FAR Part 9.505 for the Contracting Officer's review and subsequent negotiation."<br /><br />2. Provide notice that Offeror's Proposal will be due 60 days after release of the Final RFP for the GSM-O solicitation.</p>
<p>3. Interested Parties List (Attachment provided).</p>
<p>Additional Draft RFP updates are anticipated. It is the Government's intent to release information provided at the Pre-Solicitation Conference and to respond to all questions as soon as possible.</p>

<DESC><p>This 02 July 2010 update is to provide the following:</p>
<p>1. Revised OCI language. When submission of a Mitigation Plan is necessary due to a potential, perceived or actual OCI; early submission of the plan is encouraged as the Offeror must have an acceptable and Government approved Mitigation Plan established prior to contract award. The Prime Contractor is responsible for submitting a Mitigation Plan when a potential, perceived or actual OCI exists with a subcontractor, teaming partner; etc.</p>
<p>a. Section H, Paragraph H.28 is revised to reflect the following:</p>
<p>H.28 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI)/MITIGATION PLAN.&nbsp; A conflict of interest (COI) occurs when an individual or organization is involved in multiple interests, one of which could possibly corrupt the motivation for an act in the other. The Government seeks to acquire unbiased advice and/or goods and services from Offerors/Contractors that are free from, or have mitigated, such conflicts.</p>
<p>b. In order for the Government to try to prevent conflicting roles that might bias a Contractor's judgment or objectivity and potentially create a competitive advantage for that Contractor, the parties to this contract agree that the Contractor's future contracting with the Government shall be restricted as outlined in FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest, and as provided in this clause.</p>
<p>c. DISA will not intentionally exclude a vendor from a competitive acquisition due to a perceived OCI. The Contracting Office is committed to working with potential vendors to eliminate or mitigate potential, actual and perceived OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the DISA mission, or the legitimate business interests of the vendor community.</p>
<p>d. While there are no specifically-identified exclusions by type of work or by participation in other on-going DISA contracts, it is DISA's belief that an OCI may exist when the GSM-O Prime Contractor and/or its subcontractors, at any tier, their parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates, if any, are parties to any of the following situations:</p>
<p>(1) Are a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor, at any level, to another existing DISA contract (e.g., a provider of capabilities under the DATS contract; see table below) and/or <br />(2) Are a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor, at any level, under the existing GSA Alliant-Small Business GWAC contracts (which is to be used as DISA's source for support of the GSM-Projects and Support (P&amp;S) requirements), and/or<br />(3) Become a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor, at any level, in the upcoming contract award(s) of the GSM-Engineering/Transition/Implementation (ETI) solicitation (HC1028-10-R-2001).</p>
<p>e. Offerors/Contractors shall submit a Mitigation Plan to the Contracting Officer which concisely describes all relevant facts concerning any past, present or current planned interest, (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to work to be performed under the GSM-Operations contract/task orders that has/have bearing on whether the Offeror or Contractor has a possible OCI. The Mitigation Plan shall explain how the OCI will be minimized to a level acceptable to the Government. An Offeror's Mitigation Plan shall be submitted as soon as possible. If applicable, the Government may enter into negotiations with the Offeror/Contractor to address any unresolved issues within the Mitigation Plan; these negotations are not considered discussions. Note: No contract award can be made without an approved Mitigation Plan.</p>
<p>f. If the Offeror or Contractor is aware, or should have been aware, of an OCI before award of this contract or any task under against the contract, and does not fully disclose that conflict to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contractor for default.</p>
<p>g. The Offeror or Contractor, by submitting an offer and/or signing the contract, warrants that to its best knowledge and belief, no additional facts exist relevant to a possible OCI.</p>
<p>h. After contract award, the Contractor shall have an ongoing obligation to make "a prompt and full disclosure" to the Contracting Officer of any OCI that arises during the performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed before contract award.</p>
<p>i. The Mitigation Plan shall become part of the resultant contract and the Contractor shall update its Mitigation Plan within 30 days of any changes to the legal construct of the organization, subcontractor changes, or significant management or ownership changes.</p>
<p>j. Should an Offeror or Contractor refuse to disclose, or misrepresent, any information regarding a potential, actual or perceived OCI, one of the following remedies shall apply:</p>
<p>1) Disqualification for award;<br />2) Termination of the contract;<br />3) Disqualification from subsequent awards; or<br />4) Other remedial action as may be permitted or provided by the law or in the resulting contract</p>
<p>k. The following OCI Matrix provides potential Offerors/Contractors with examples of situations where Mitigation Plans may or may not be required by the Contracting Officer.</p>

<br />Notes:<br />1. While each case is analyzed on its own facts, there is no generalized need for mitigation in this situation.<br />2. While a case-by-case analysis will be required, based on the PWS current at the time of analysis the<br />Offeror/Contractor will likely be required to submit a Mitigation Plan, and the Contracting Officer may<br />implement its own Mitigation Plan.<br />3. Mitigation Plan may be required.</p>
<p>l. The Mitigation Plan shall be included as part of the resultant contract/task order.</p>
<p>m. A clause, similar to H.28, must be included in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Section I, 52.209-9000 ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (OCCI) (DEC 2005) is hereby removed.</p>
<p>c. Section L, Paragraph L8.7.4.5 Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Mitigation Plan is changed to reflect the following:</p>
<p>"L8.7.4.5 Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Mitigation Plan. (Reference Draft RFP HC1028-10-R-2001, Section H, Paragraph H.28. The Government requires the work product provided by the GSM-ETI Contractor be uninfluenced by suggestions that the work product(s) from other GSM contracts/task orders (i.e., GSM-O and/or GSM-P&amp;S) or other DISA contracts unfairly benefited the non-GSM-ETI vendor. To prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might bias the GSM-ETI Contractor's judgement and/or prevent an unfair competitive advantage, the Government's preference is that the Offeror will not enter into business arrangements with any contractor awarded work on the GSM O, GSM-P&amp;S contracts and/or other DISA contracts. In the event that the Offeror determines it is necessary to enter into a business arrangement that that could be perceived as a potential or actual conflict of interest, the Offeror shall submit an OCI Mitigation Plan describing how the potential OCI will be avoided, neutralized or mitigated based on the general rules of FAR Part 9.505 for the Contracting Officer's review and subsequent negotiation."</p>
<p>2. Interested Parties List (Attachment provided).</p>
<p>Additional Draft RFP updates are anticipated. It is the Government's intent to release information provided at the Pre-Solicitation Conference and to respond to all questions as soon as possible.</p>

<CONTACT>Captain Wayne Geschwindt 910-451-7854
<DESC>Q.  In the original Solicitation, Section H.1 Special Contract Requirements - Wage Determinations 1997-0304 and 1195-0751 are incorporated into this contract.  Both of these determinations are for North Carolina.  Which wage determination should a contractor use who is performing services under the contract in Area 3 (Albany, GA)?
A.  The Wage Determinations for all the counties in Area III are 95-0574 Rev. 27, 95-0611 Rev 25, 01-0032 Rev. 16, 95-0611 Rev 25, and 95-0646 Rev 25 dated 22 June 2010. 
Q.  With two North Carolina Wage Determinations having been incorporated into the Solicitation, how is the Contractor to determine which Wage Determination to use.  In previous Direct Procurement Method contracts and in the current active contract, Wage Determination 1997-0304 is the Wage Determination that has been incorporated.  I would respectfully suggest that this is the more appropriate Wage Determination for the Area 1 (Camp Lejeune) and Area 2 (Cherry Point) services.  Please clarify.
A.  The correct Department of Labor Wage Determination for Areas I and II is No. 95-0751 Revision No. 25 dated 22 June 2010.
Q.  In CLIN 0003, Item 0003 AA and Item 0003 AB (Base Year), the Estimated annual quantities are listed as "NR".  However, in the subsequent Option Years there is an Estimated annual quantity listed.  Is this accurate?
A.  No.  The subsequent option periods should read NR.  See M67001-10-R-0002-0003 for changes to subCLINs 1003AA and AB, 2003AA and AB, 3003AA and AB, and 4003AA and AB.
Q.  In CLIN 0004, Item 0004 AA (Base Year), the Estimated annual quantities are listed as "NR".  However, in the subsequent Option Years there is an Estimated annual quantity listed.  Is this accurate?
A.  No.  The subsequent option periods should read NR.  See M67001-10-R-0002-0003 for changes to subCLINs 1004AA, 2004AA, 3004AA, and 4004AA.
Q.  In CLIN 0005, Item 0005 AA (Base Year), the Estimated annual quantities are listed as "NR".  However, in the subsequent Option Years there is an Estimated annual quantity listed.  Is this accurate?
A.  No.  The subsequent option periods should read NR.  See M67001-10-R-0002-0003 for changes to subCLINs 1005AA, 2005AA, 3005AA, and 4005AA.
Q.  In CLIN 0047, Item 0047 AC (Base Year) and Item 2047 AC (Option Year 2), the Item "47 AC" is "Disassembly of Government-Owned Containers", yet in Option Year 1, Option Year 3, and Option Year 4, Item "47 AC is for Assembly of Government-Owned Containers.  In those same Option Years (1, 3, 4), Item "47 AD" is for Disassembly of Government-Owned Containers.  In the Base Year and Option Year 2, there is not an Item "47 AD" listed at all.  Please clarify.
A.  The correct subCLIN structure was used in Option Periods 1, 3, and 4.  The base period and Option Period 2 have been changed in M67001-10-R-0002-003 so all these services are described the same way for each period.
Q.  In the Solicitation section for Area 1 (Camp Lejeune) CLIN 0013, there are three different services listed as requirements:
1)      A. Item 0013 AA - HHG - Attempted Pickup
B. Item 0013 AB - Unaccompanied Baggage - Attempted Pickup
2)  Item 0013 AC - Extra Pickup
3)  Item 0013 AD - Cancellation of Previously Scheduled Move
 However, in Area 2 (Cherry Point, NC) for the same Item 13, only one service is listed - Attempted Pickups for HHG and Unaccompanied Baggage.  Extra Pickups and Cancellations of Previously Scheduled Moves are not listed at all.  Please clarify.
A.  These services have been added to Area II and Area III.  As a result the subCLINs for 0049, 1049, 2049, 3049, 4049, 0079, 1079, 2079, 2079, and 4079 have changed in M67001-10-R-0002-0003.

<DESC>Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) has issued the VA Innovation Initiative (VAi2) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Industry Innovation Competition (Industry-IC), see attached file. The Industry-IC invites interested contractors to contribute ideas (within the topics of this BAA) for innovations that increase Veteran access to VA services, reduce or control costs of delivering those services, enhance the performance of VA operations and improve the quality of service that Veterans and their families receive. 
Proposals can be submitted to vai2baa@va.gov during the life of the BAA. The BAA is open until September 30 and while proposals may be submitted any time up to that date, in order to make project awards before the end of the fiscal year (September 30), VA will begin the evaluation process on July 6. Evaluations will be conducted on a rolling basis and awards will continue until available funds have expired. It is VA's intent to finish as much of the selection process as possible by early August.
Proposals can be submitted under one or multiple topics and must be clearly stated so within the proposal. The BAA allows for multiple awards. Each award will have a period of performance of up to twenty-four months. VA intends to maximize use of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contracts resulting from this BAA; however, offerors may propose alternate contract types providing that the alternative is supported in the proposal.
The Government is not entertaining pre-proposal meetings and/or pre-proposal discussions.  It is not at the Government's discretion to determine if and where innovative ideas fall within the BAA. Specific questions may be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer and we will post all questions and answers to the VAi2 website at www.va.gov/vai2 under the FAQs in the About Tab. 
All questions and responses from the June 16th Webinar can be found here: VAi2 Webinar Question and Answers.  
This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this BAA. No contract award(s) will be made unless funds are available.
The point of contact for any questions related to BAA may be addressed to Ms. Lauren Oliver, Contract Specialist, email: Lauren.Oliver@va.gov and Mrs. Carol Newcomb, Contracting Officer, email: Carol.Newcomb@va.gov.

The Industry-IC invites interested contractors to contribute ideas (within the topics of this BAA) for innovations that increase Veteran access to VA services, reduce or control costs of delivering those services, enhance the performance of VA operations and improve the quality of service that Veterans and their families receive. 
Proposals can be submitted to vai2baa@va.gov during the life of the BAA. The BAA is open until September 30 and while proposals may be submitted any time up to that date, in order to make project awards before the end of the fiscal year (September 30), VA will begin the evaluation process on July 6. Evaluations will be conducted on a rolling basis and awards will continue until available funds have expired. It is VA's intent to finish as much of the selection process as possible by early August.
Proposals can be submitted under one or multiple topics and must be clearly stated so within the proposal. The BAA allows for multiple awards. Each award will have a period of performance of up to twenty-four months. VA intends to maximize use of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contracts resulting from this BAA; however, offerors may propose alternate contract types providing that the alternative is supported in the proposal.
The Government is not entertaining pre-proposal meetings and/or pre-proposal discussions.  It is not at the Government's discretion to determine if and where innovative ideas fall within the BAA. Specific questions may be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer and we will post all questions and answers to the VAi2 website at www.va.gov/vai2 under the FAQs in the About Tab. 
All questions and responses from the June 16th Webinar can be found here: http://www4.va.gov/VAI2/VAi2XFAQs.html. 
This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this BAA. No contract award(s) will be made unless funds are available.
The point of contact for any questions related to BAA may be addressed to Ms. Lauren Oliver, Contract Specialist, email: Lauren.Oliver@va.gov and Mrs. Carol Newcomb, Contracting Officer, email: Carol.Newcomb@va.gov.

In compliance with this Act, the Government posts this notice that TaskOrder (TO) 48 was issued under contract NNJ08JB01C, the Environmental Contract, toprocure environmental services in support of the JSC Building 16E and 48 Roof Replacementfunded by the Recovery Act. The environmental services include technical support such astransportation and disposal of Industrial Solid Waste (asbestos containing material, leadwaste etc.) and project oversight.  In addition modification 108 was issued for fundingTask Order 48. &lt;P&gt;The Environmental Contract was awarded on a competitive basis. These Task Orders wereissued under the cost-type contract arrangement in accordance with the contract. Acost-type arrangement is appropriate due to uncertainties involved in contractperformance that do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use anytype of fixed-price contract. In addition, a cost-type contract was selected to providethe contractor the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given thetypes of services to be performed. This Environmental Contract has experienced personneland documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet therequirements of the Recovery Act in the most prudent business manner, with the timeconstraints imposed, the existing Environmental Contract is the most appropriatecontractual vehicle for the work required.

<DESC>(Subject Continued)  and parking lots at Alabama River Lakes.<br><br>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER W91278-08-C-0028.<BR><BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-08-C-0028, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Alabama River Lakes Project, awarded to Eagle Aviation Services and Technology, Inc., 1801 Robert Fulton Drive STE 450, Reston, Virginia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for in order to complete the upgrading of Gunter Hill Campground, specifically to renovate the existing sewer system, provide sewer service to all camp sites, and pave/re-pave all campground roads and parking lots.  The work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions which includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems in all of the recreation areas.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of this recreation area.  2)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20,  Puget Sound Seattle VA  Medical Center

2.  Description of Action:  This justification for other than full and open competition for 
Comprehensive BRACHanalysis testing to be performed by Myriad Genetics Laboratory. 

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  This requirement is for specialized genetic testing for BRACAnalysis - BRAC 1 and BRAC 2 gene analysis for susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. There is a history of breast cancer in the patient's family and testing is required for patient's treatment. 

4.  Statutory Authority:  
	( X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will 
 		Satisfy Agency Requirements;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, 
		or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  IAW FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2) this test is uniquely offered by only one vendor. IAW FAR 6.302-2(a)(2)(b)(2) delay in the award of this requirement will result in specimen decay and inability to perform the test.  This delay could result in serious injury to the Government and its ability to service its Veterans.

6.  Actions to Promote Competition:  IAW FAR 5.202(a)(2) the proposed contract action is urgent and compelling.  The requesting service will attempt to utilize mandatory sources of reference laboratories in future acquisitions.  The referenced vendor is the only known source for this testing, there is no known secondary source.  

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $ 3,400.00  IAW FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii). Myraid is the only reference laboratory offering this test.  Pricing is determined fair and reasonable based on vendor availability. 
  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  
Mandatory sources of supply were contacted and do not offer the testing done by Myriad.  
                                              
9.  Other Considerations: No other considerations. 

10.  Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<AWDNBR>HSTS07-10-D-00083
<ARCHDATE>07062010
<DESC>The Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition has been reviewed and approved in accordance with established TSA procedures and FAR 6.305.
The Government schedules mission status travel through a Computer Reservations System (CRS).  These automated systems are used to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related to air travel.  Major CRS operations that book and sell tickets for multiple airlines are known as Global Distribution Systems (GDS).   The Government requires a full range of automated travel services including the ability of the GDS to internally house/store all data records for up to three years, prioritize access in times of heavy system usage, and include the ability to electronically submit a weekly reconciliation report.  In addition, the contractor must provide 24 hour/7 day a week support contact for all hardware and software issues including advance notification of all scheduled system changes and/or downtime.  
The Government's technical requirement is for three primary segments of a solution: GDS services, GDS connection, and GDS desktop software. The Government requires a GDS that will provide the full range of services for travel services, including but not limited to: automated system capabilities, help desk and support services, electronic data storage and records management related to travel records, priority access in times of heavy system usage, direct connection or answer back capability with US flagged commercial airlines and hotels, ability to electronically submit a weekly reconciliation report, queue placing, guaranteed teletype resolution for all messaging between native system and air carriers. Additionally, the contractor's facilities and electronic systems shall adhere to Government security requirements, including all infrastructures supporting the system, which includes but is not limited to-- data, software data, and storage facilities-- shall be physically located within the United States.  All network data must be encrypted using government approved ciphers.
Only Sabre Incorporated can meet the Government's GDS requirement for the following reasons:
Due to the enormous complexity of ensuring the multiple systems interface seamlessly both the Government's internal and external applications have been customized to interact with Sabre's GDS. Sabre Incorporated is currently the only responsible source capable of satisfying this requirement.
Since the government's reservation information has been determined SSI, only sources who have infrastructure, including servers, networks, and data storage facilities, located in the United States and are administrered by U.S. citizens can meet the government's requirement.  .
Based on the extensive modifications and the estimated cost necessary to develop compatibility testing, without even the certainty that at that time, there would be other GDS who could meet the Governments technical and security requirements, it has been determined that it is not in the Government's best interest to pursue this effort at this time, as it would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that could not be recovered through competition over time.
Several types of Market Research were conducted in support of the current requirement.  
-Review of Historical acquisition information contained in the current contract.
-Knowledge Sharing Meeting with the Program Manager and COTR to discuss current Business Practices in this industry.
-Review of Internet Sources to determine commercial practices for GDS.
-Search via Internet to compile a possible list of available sources that operate GDS. 
-Public posting of a synopsis on FedBizOpps with a statement addressing potential interested parties.
This requirement was previously awarded on a Sole Source Basis to Sabre Incorporated, under the authority Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.3.8, because of the customizations and level of integration required under the governments internal and external systems.  
Based on the synopsis posted March 19, 2010 on FedBizOpps, at this time no additional sources have indicated an interest in meeting the Governemnt's requirement or requested additional information.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1

Upon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the Contractual action described below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.

1.	Agency and Contracting Activity

Department of Veterans Affairs		VA Medical Center
Network Heartland VISN 15			800 Hospital Drive
4101 S. 4th St. Trafficway			Columbia, MO  65201
Leavenworth, KS  66048-5505

2.	Description of Action Being Approved

Proposed sole source procurement for three Arthroscopic sets. The estimated cost is projected to be $42,660.00.

3.	Description of Supplies Required to Meet Agency's Needs

The replacement parts must meet the exact specifications of the originals to be compatible in form, fit, and function. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition

The authority permitting other than full and open competition in this instance is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source is available and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements".

5.	Rational Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above

These are specialized instruments which have a low profile head for hard to reach areas and have unique shapes, sizes, and angles that are not found with other manufacturers. Confirmed by market research from Olympus, Karl Storz, and Linvatec the Arthrex instruments have wider tips, angles and handle styles that other vendors cannot provide. These instruments also match and work with the existing Artrex sets used at the Columbia, VAMC.  

6.	Efforts to Solicit Potential Sources

The Columbia Station Inventory Manager has checked FSS, NAC, Medcompare, and Google websites and could not find any other vendors which sold that specialized type of instruments requested.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost by Contracting Officer

Cost to the Government is deemed fair & reasonable compared to similar instruments of this nature.  

8.	Market Research

Market research was conducted by the Contracting Officer and there were no available items of these exact specifications available from FSS, NAC, Google or other available vendors that sell these exact type of instruments.

9.	Other Facts Supporting Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition

a.	Arthrex is the only distributor and manufacture of the items.

b.	No other sources will meet the needs of the Columbia VAMC.

c.	Other sources will be evaluated or considered as they become available.


10.	Listing of Sources That Expressed in Writing an Interest in the Acquisition

N/A

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 18,  Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System

2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of a construction project to construct an 8,200 SF MRI Suite, Bldg 81 on the Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System campus, project number 678-CSI-102.  

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  Completely prepare site for building operations, including demolition and removal or existing structures, and furnish labor and materials and perform work for construction of new MRI facility, approximately 8,200 SF as required by specifications and drawing  

4.	Statutory Authority:  

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability,
		 or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(X)  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  IAW VAAR 819.7007(a) the contracting officer may award contracts to SDVOSB concerns on a sole source basis provided the anticipated award price will not exceed $5 million; the requirement is synopsized in accordance with FAR part 5 and the SDVOSB has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance and award can be made at a fair and reasonable price.  IAW VAAR 819.7007(b) the contracting officers determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer.   A determination that only one SDVOSB concern is available to meet the requirement is not required.       

6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  There will be no action taken to increase competition for this acquisition.  Upon approval of this J&A, a formal solicitation (Solicitation Number VA-258-10-RP-0094) will be issued in April 2010.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The magnitude of this project is between $2-5 million.   The contractor will be required to break down his proposal into line item detail and that will be compared against the independent government furnished cost estimate provided by the Architect and Engineer (A & E).   

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10): The proposed contractor (Sygnos, Inc of out San Diego, CA) is on the list of SDVOSB potential contractors in CCR. Sygnos, Inc is a SDVOSB construction firm who is technically capable/acceptable for performing general construction projects for SAVAHCS.  Sygnos, Inc has presented itself at a capability presentation at this facility, the most recent being April 23, 2009.   An inquiry to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) revealed three previous projects that were all favorable rated.  The company has also performed several contracts at other VA facilities.  Additionally, the Contracting Officer checked for the contractors registration on VETBIZ.  Additional market research consisted of searching the following various databases:  Dun & Bradstreet, CCR.gov, PPIRS, ORCA, and EPLS as well as other debarred web sites.  It is in the governments best interest to utilize VAAR 819.7007(a) and pursue a sole-source award to Sygnos, Inc for this requirement.   

9.	Other Considerations:  The selected SDVOSB contractor has been looking for opportunities to develop a better working history with the Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System.  They have performed successfully at other locations within VISN 18 as well other VA facilities.  A project such as this would be a good opportunity for the VA to expand its contractor base, and potentially test out a new SDVOSB for future projects.

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: N/A

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: Not applicable.    This sole source procurement is permitted under VAAR 819.7007  

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
