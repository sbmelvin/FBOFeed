<CONTACT>Henry Rodriguez, Contract Negotiator, Phone 405-739-3363, Fax 405-739-7857, Email henry.rodriguez@tinker.af.mil
<DESC>The internal liner and hearth for vertical loading high temperature vacuum furnace #37 at Tinker AFB, OK 73145, provide a uniform insulation area for heat-treat processing of a complete spectrum for jet engine components.  The Hearth and Liner are unique to Vacuum Furnace Systems model VEQ 5654-2, (Part No. DB18653) and the Original Equipment Manufacturer is the only cognizant source with a manufacturing capacity to satisfy agency requirements to presently known true OEM specifications.  Tinker AFB has neither the specifications (which are proprietary data) nor direct knowledge to properly reverse engineer hot zone assemblies.  Please note:  The massive nature of VFS Graform graphite heating elements prove to be too heavy for utilization of the existing hot zone power supply and any form of conversion is not an option.  Additionally, a Metal Shielded Hot Zone is disadvantageous to an Insulated Hot Zone in regards to power consumption, life expectancy of the zone, lower replacement/rebuild cost, and under bake out when dirty conditions, ability to increase furnace temperature above 2,400 degrees F.  Solicitation of hot zone and hearth assembly for vacuum furnace shall be sole source to Vacuum Furnace Systems, Souderton, PA  18964.

The Government is conducting an Advisory Multi-Step Process in accordance with FAR Part 15.202. The acquisition will unfold in two phases as described below: 

Phase 1  Advisory Evaluation

In the initial phase of the acquisition, the Government is requesting interested parties to submit existing product literature generally available in the industry. Vendors are invited to submit literature for more than one product that will meet the Government's needs. Once received, the Government will evaluate each submission on whether 1) the information satisfies minimum technical requirements listed above, 2) expandability of the recorder, and 3) additionally supported interfaces. After completion of the evaluation, the Government will notify, in writing, each submitter whether the Government believes, based upon the submission, it would likely be a viable competitor in the resultant acquisition the Government expects to conduct. Any potential offeror that provides literature may, at its election, participate in the expected acquisition regardless of advice provided by the Government in response to its submission. 

Please make submissions electronically to the attention of Anthony Gatlin at anthony.gatlin@navy.mil. Submissions are due no later than 4:00pm on December 11, 2006 Eastern Standard Time. Literature is limited to no more than 10 pages per product. Point of contact is Anthony Gatlin 301-757-9766.

Phase 2  Award of Multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts

Upon completion of advisory evaluation, Phase 2 will be initiated by issuing a formal Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government anticipates issuing an RFP in January 2007.  Offerors will be required to submit firm-fixed price proposals.  The Government will evaluate offers and intends to award one or more IDIQ contacts to offerors that represent the best value to the Government. Each contract award will be for a minimum quantity of one (1) recorder with an Option to order up to 150 recorders under individual delivery orders. The order of one (1) will meet the minimum quantity requirement for the contract. Initial quantity one (1) will be acquired for further evaluation. During this evaluation, the recorder will be examined under a simulated real-world environment. 

The Government intends to exercise the option under one (1) contract based on the results of the hands-on evaluation.

<SUBJECT>D -- PERSONNEL SERVICES DELIVERY TRANSFORMATION
<SOLNBR>R1436
<CONTACT>David Bailey david.m.bailey@randolph.af.mil
<DESC>Personnel Services Delivery Transformation seeks to replace face to face, paper based personnel transactions with web-based, collaborative, automated self-service applications that require little, if any, face to face efforts and entail electronic document preparation, routing and storage thus eliminating the need for the preparation, storage, and routing of paper documents. The objectives and ultimate goal of the program is to modernize personnel services delivery to enhance warfighting capabilities, provide more responsive and better support to Air Force personnel, and reduce the resource footprint dedicated to managing personnel and personnel transactions. AF/A1, Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC), Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC), and Air National Guard A1 (NGB/A1) are deeply involved in transforming personnel processes and modernizing infrastructure. Civilian, active duty military and reserve Contact Centers have been established and are currently providing support for a limited number of personnel transactions. Transformation activities are scheduled to continue through 2011. Additionally, the Air Force is preparing for the fielding of several DoD systems that will replace current service applications in part or whole. The Air Force PSDT program facilitates the preparation for these systems and provides capability the Air Force requires over and above that anticipated in these DoD wide systems.  The AF is looking to employ a Strategic Partnership concept that seeks to replace a myriad of existing support contractors with a single provider. This service provider will provide a team of talent capable of maintaining current operations and legacy systems, streamlining transaction process transformation, provide systems integration expertise to ensure a transition to Total Force Service Centers that provide seamless services regardless of component affiliation. They will also provide insight and advice on system integration requirements with the new DoD and Air Force systems and processes. The establishment of a Strategic Partnership will be an integral part of any resulting contract. This will facilitate future transformation activities and provide a forum to identify commercial service and IT innovations that may enhance future Air Force operations.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

For this item, the offeror must identify the production source or his intent to produce the it em himself.  Award consideration will be given to an offeror who produces the item or acquires it from a second source in the United States.  This criterion is based on FAR excerpts as follows:  Per FAR 6.202 (a)(1), establishing or maintaining alternative  sources, a particular source may be excluded from this contract action in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources for the supplies because it would be in the interest of national defense in having a facility (or a producer, manufac turer, or other supplier) available for furnishing the supplies in case of a national emergency or industrial mobilization.  As per FAR 6.302-3(b)(v)(A), it is necessary to create the required domestic capability for production of supplies by limiting comp etition to items manufactured in the United States or divide current production requirements among two or more contractors to provide for an adequate mobilization base.

One Indefinite Delive ry Contract (IDC) will be negotiated and awarded, with a total contract period not to exceed five years. The contract may consist of a base period not to exceed one year, with a maximum of four one-year option periods. Alternatively, the contract may consi st of one five-year contract period. The total amount of work will not exceed $2,225,000 per contract. An option period may be exercised when the contract amount for the base period or preceding option period has been exhausted or nearly exhausted. Work wi ll be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price Task Orders. Award of the contract is anticipated in 2nd quarter, FY07. The method used to allocate task orders among contracts will include consideration of experience and user needs, capacity to accomplish the order in the required timeframe, performance. Funds are not presently available for the contracts. THIS PROCUREMENT IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. The small business standard for this effort is based on the average number of employees being less than 500. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employees office location (not  the location of the work). To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offer or ineligible for award. Task orders may be assigned for any work within the jurisdiction of North Atlantic Division but the selection will be based on criteria within the Norfolk District.  DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT 1.1	Contract Description.  This contract effort includes but is not limited to analytical services support for the GeoEnvironmental Engineering (GeoE) Branch of the Norfolk District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), for the chemical analysis of soil, sediment, sludge, ground water, surface water, oil, waste, and other environmental samples.  Analytical services will be performed by the Contract Laboratory in support of the GeoE Section programs.  In most instances, the Contract Laboratory shall be resp onsible for providing coolers, sample bottles, preservation solutions, trip blanks (if applicable), and supplies.  All costs associated with these tasks shall be borne by the Contractor and not billed separately. 1.2	Contract Background.  The Norfolk District GeoE Section routinely collects or receives primary samples and quality assurance samples that have been collected from various hazardous and toxic waste (HTW) sites, military installations, process streams or  waste streams, or typical environmental sources, such as rivers, lakes, and streams.  The sampling and analytical work will primarily be in conjunction with investigations for the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERC LA); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA); the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); and others, including underground storage tank (UST) investigations, the Department of Defense Environm ental Restoration Program - Formerly Used Defense Sites (DERP-FUDS), and the Installation Restoration Program (IRP).    1.3	Contract Objectives.  The objective of this contract is to obtain an analytical laboratory which can provide technically valid and legally defensible environmental data that will meet or exceed the required site-specific Data Quality Objectives (DQOs).   This contract describes the management policies, objectives, principles and procedures which wil l be used to generate data of the required quality.  This contract also defines the quality assurance program for oversight of the Contract Laboratory activities and for the evaluation of the analytical data generated by the Contract Laboratory.  All work performed under this contract shall meet the applicable portions of the USACE Engineering Regulation 1110-1-263, Chemical Data Quality Management for Hazardous Waste Remedial Activities, and any revisions to that document.  Revisions shall be forwarded to the contractors as they are approved by the USACE.  A copy of this regulation may be obtained by contacting Mr. Marc D. Gutterman at 757)441-7668. 1.4	Contract Estimated Quantities.  It is estimated that requests for approximately 300 analyses may be submitted yearly.  The Contract Laboratory shall be required to furnish all labor, instrumentation, equipment, tools, and supplies required to perform t he analyses.  Subcontracting of samples sent to the laboratory shall not be permitted without written approval from the Norfolk District Contracting Officers Representative (COR). 1.5 	Contract Delivery Orders.  Any service required under this contract will be ordered by the issuance of a delivery order.  In addition to sample type, quantity and analyses required, the delivery order shall specify whether coolers and sample container s are needed for sample collection.  Quantity of samples sent on a delivery order will vary based on project requirements and could even be a single sample.  Work accepted by the Contract Laboratory is expected to meet all of the conditions and requirement s of this contract. 1.6	Notification of Equipment Failure.  If the Contract Laboratory experiences a breakdown of equipment such that samples for a particular test cannot be analyzed, the Contract Laboratory must notify the Norfolk District GeoE Section within one (1) day.  T his notification will allow the Norfolk District to stop sending samples requiring that particular test.  Once the Contract Laboratory can begin performing that analysis again, it must notify the Norfolk District GeoE Section in order to begin receiving sa mples with that particular analysis again.  If the Contract Laboratory has samples in-house with analysis which require the disabled equipment and either the holding time or turnaroud time will expire before the Contract Laboratory can replace or fix the e quipment, then the Contract Laboratory must send the samples back to the Norfolk District GeoE Section.

The wages and benefi ts of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employees office location (not the location of the  work). To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for aw ard. Task orders may be assigned for any work within the jurisdiction of North Atlantic Division but the selection will be based on criteria within the Norfolk District.  DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT 1.1	Contract Description.  This contract effort includes but is not limited to analytical services support for the GeoEnvironmental Engineering (GeoE) Branch of the Norfolk District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), for the chemical analysis of soil, sediment, sludge, ground water, surface water, oil, waste, and other environmental samples.  Analytical services will be performed by the Contract Laboratory in support of the GeoE Section programs.  In most instances, the Contract Laboratory shall be resp onsible for providing coolers, sample bottles, preservation solutions, trip blanks (if applicable), and supplies.  All costs associated with these tasks shall be borne by the Contractor and not billed separately. 1.2	Contract Background.  The Norfolk District GeoE Section routinely collects or receives primary samples and quality assurance samples that have been collected from various hazardous and toxic waste (HTW) sites, military installations, process streams or  waste streams, or typical environmental sources, such as rivers, lakes, and streams.  The sampling and analytical work will primarily be in conjunction with investigations for the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Li ability Act (CERCLA); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA); the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); and others, including underground storage tank (UST) investigations, the Department of  Defense Environmental Restoration Program - Formerly Used Defense Sites (DERP-FUDS), and the Installation Restoration Program (IRP).    1.3	Contract Objectives.  The objective of this contract is to obtain an analytical laboratory which can provide technically valid and legally defensible environmental data that will meet or exceed the required site-specific Data Quality Objectives (DQOs).   This contract describes the management policies, objectives, principles and procedures which will be used to generate data of the required quality.  This contract also defines the quality assurance program for oversight of the Contract Laboratory activit ies and for the evaluation of the analytical data generated by the Contract Laboratory.  All work performed under this contract shall meet the applicable portions of the USACE Engineering Regulation 1110-1-263, Chemical Data Quality Management for Hazardou s Waste Remedial Activities, and any revisions to that document.  Revisions shall be forwarded to the contractors as they are approved by the USACE.  A copy of this regulation may be obtained by contacting Mr. Marc D. Gutterman at 757)441-7668. 1.4	Contract Estimated Quantities.  It is estimated that requests for approximately 300 analyses may be submitted yearly.  The Contract Laboratory shall be required to furnish all labor, instrumentation, equipment, tools, and supplies required to perform t he analyses.  Subcontracting of samples sent to the laboratory shall not be permitted without written approval from the Norfolk District Contracting Officers Representative (COR). 1.5 	Contract Delivery Orders.  Any service required under this contract will be ordered by the issuance of a delivery order.  In addition to sample type, quantity and analyses required, the delivery order shall specify whether coolers and sample container s are needed for sample collection.  Quantity of samples sent on a delivery order will vary based on project requirements and could even be a single sample.  Work accepted by the Contract Laboratory is expected to meet all of the conditions and requirement s of this contract. 1.6	Notification of Equipment Failure.  If the Contract Laboratory experiences a breakdown of equipment such that samples for a particular test cannot be analyzed, the Contract Laboratory must notify the Norfolk District GeoE Section within one (1) day.  T his notification will allow the Norfolk District to stop sending samples requiring that particular test.  Once the Contract Laboratory can begin performing that analysis again, it must notify the Norfolk District GeoE Section in order to begin receiving sa mples with that particular analysis again.  If the Contract Laboratory has samples in-house with analysis which require the disabled equipment and either the holding time or turnaroud time will expire before the Contract Laboratory can replace or fix the e quipment, then the Contract Laboratory must send the samples back to the Norfolk District GeoE Section.  The GeoE Section will then send them to another MRD Chemistry Branch validated laboratory.

1) Synopsis of Statement of Work: Full text of draft SOW can be provided upon request.

5) Any other recommendations or comments regarding this Draft that will aid the Government in placing this requirement competitively.

The lead firm(s) selected for contract award will be engineering design firm(s) as the majority of services to be performed under this contract(s) will generally be civil/environmental engineering in nature. The contract type will be firm fixed-priced. The Government may, if appropriate, elect to award a single task order contract or to award multiple task order contracts to one or more sources under this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award contracts, based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference, to the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work. Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued. FAR Part 16 requires that each multiple awardee be given a fair opportunity of consideration for each proposed task order award. In order to provide a fair opportunity and equitable distribution of task orders amongst the awardees, the Contracting Officer will rotate the selection of equally capable awardee based on the location of project, technical capability, capacity, experience, past performance, quality of deliverables, timeliness, and other factors that the Contracting Officer, in the exercise of sound business judgment, believes are relevant to the placement of orders.  2.

Paragraph 8, SPECIALIZED SERVICES, is hereby revised and the following shall be inserted in lieu thereof: In the course of doing business with A/E firms under contract with the NPS, our office occasionally needs to obtain specialized services that may be provided by a subcontractor under the prime contract for A/E services.  Where the majority of work may be performed solely by the sub consultant with little involvement of the prime contractor, NPS does not intend to approve or consent to the prime contractor receiving an administrative handling, coordination or related overhead charge for the sub contractor's services.  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications should take this into consideration. 4.  Paragraph 10, REQUIRED REGISTRATION, is hereby revised and the following shall be inserted in lieu thereof: To be eligible for award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) registrar via the CCR Internet site at www.ccr.gov and to have completed the electronic Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov. 5.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR PAVING AT THE URBAN WATERSHED RESEARCH FACILITY (UWRF).  THE SOLICITATION WITH THE STATEMENT OF WORK, DRAWING, SITE VISIT INFORMATION, AND APPLICABLE ATTACHMENTS HAS BEEN POSTED ON THE INTERNET AT THE FEDBIZOPPS WEBSITE UNDER THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Water Supply and Water Resources Division, 2890 Woodbridge Avenue, Edison, New Jersey, requires paving for the Urban Watershed Research Facility (UWRF).  The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials, tools, equipment, hardware, and documentation necessary to complete the project.  The project consists of two objectives:  (A) Connect parking lot and laboratories to the road leading up to the UWRF via Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) of Parking Lot Grade.   (B) Allow for the collection of Stormwater Runoff from the newly paved area.   The Contractor shall:  (1)  Grade and trench the site as necessary so that the pavement can be installed.  Approximately 2300 sq ft will need to be graded.  There are remnants of existing pavement under much of this area. Where possible, grading should adhere to current grade.   (2)  A 10 ft wide, 140 ft long vehicle access run of hot mix asphalt of parking lot grade is required from the end of the existing road to the greenhouse.  This should be straight as possible given the layout of the facility. In addition, asphalt shall be used to connect the concrete pavement in front of the high bay to the new strip of asphalt.  Two 4 ft walkways are required and pavement should abut ramp for handicap access by back stairs.  To connect the existing parking lot to the high bay and laboratory, additional sections of asphalt are anticipated.  The Drawing provided with the solicitation provides a proposed layout.  This drawing is only partially to scale.  Total estimated area of coverage is approximately 2300 sq ft.   (3)  Curbs or an appropriate alternative are to be provided at grade of pavement to keep asphalt from spreading and cracking.  Curbing at grade level with pavement will be required around the 20 ft section leading to the parking lot due to the change in slope.  Surface drainage shall be routed to collect in three central locations and away from walkways. Upon completion of each task identified above the EPA Project Officer will inspect the work for acceptance. A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.  Contract award will be made using best value methodology.  Two (2) evaluation factors will be used: Past Performance and Price.  Past Performance and Price are approximately equal in importance.  The anticipated contract performance period is four (4) months after receipt of the notice to proceed.  The estimated price of the work is between $25,000 and $100,000.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  All prospective offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration system in order to be eligible for contract award.  See the website www.ccr.gov for information about registration. PROPOSALS ARE DUE BY WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2006.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided.  Interested parties may contact Scott Tharp, in writing, via fax (513) 487-2107 or email at Tharp.Scott@epa.gov with questions.

<DESC>Product Improvements for the BQM-167A Subscale Aerial Target - The Air Armament Center, Air-to-Air Missile Wing, Aerial Targets Squadron, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL. BQM-167 subscale aerial targets are being procured under a competitively awarded contract with Composite Engineering, Inc., using full and open competition procedures.   691st ARSS plans to contract for development efforts to enhance system maintainability and the ability of the BQM-167A to meet operational performance objectives not attainable in the baseline target configuration and for support to BQM-167A pre-operational ground and flight test activities.  Improvements anticipated by the Government include recovery system maintainability enhancements, launch phase improvements, radar cross section augmentation and reliability growth.  
Maintainability improvements include, but are not limited to, reduction of resources and schedule required for recovery system preparation for flight.  The BQM-167A parachute configuration, driven by the heavy weight target launch configuration, takes significantly longer to prepare and pack than legacy subscale target systems impacting availability and supportability.  A study to identify alternatives to reduce this maintenance impact without adversely impacting the target survivability during recovery is anticipated with a follow-on development, integration, and test activity to verify operation and maintenance performance of the selected alternative.  
Improvements in the system to ensure consistent target system performance during the launch phase of the flight will also be pursued.  This effort is expected to include design modifications to the BQM-167A launch rail, as well as, on-target Rocket Assisted Take-Off (RATO) bottle attachment equipment in order to achieve consistent performance during target departure from the rail and during RATO separation from the target.  In addition, the launch phase improvements will include and effort to enhance the robustness of the launch phase portion of the BQM-167A flight simulator.  Under reliability growth a study to assess the target design and determine opportunities to increase system reliability and follow-on development, integration, and test activities to incorporate and verify selected system design changes is planned.  
Finally, support to Government conducted pre-operational ground and flight test activities, including participation in test planning, test conduct, and data analysis, will be required.  Completion of these tasks is required prior to September 2007.  A Government-owned technical data package of the baseline AFSAT design does not exist to provide interested parties for use in these development efforts. The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336411 with a size standard of 1,500 employees. Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) demonstrating their ability to meet the requirements of these efforts within the required schedule. Responses are required NLT 22 Dec 05. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This Sources Sought Synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort. See Numbered Notes 25 and 26.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Weather Service (NWS) is conducting market research for the replacement of a thermostatic switch in its NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radar WSR-88D. The thermostatic switch is intended to open when the high-voltage oil reservoir overheats in the WSR-88D transmitter. However, the setpoint temperature of the existing thermostatic switch is too high to protect the transmitter. Overheating has occurred, causing transmitter shutdown due to component failures, without ever reaching the setpoint of the thermostatic switch. The existing thermostatic switch is model M24236/25-HHJBA, which opens between 178 degrees F and 189 degrees F. The desired replacement switch will be form-fit-function compatible, but with the contacts opening between 123 degrees F and 134 degrees F  (e.g. M24236/25-HFHBA or -HFCAA). The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from thermostatic switch manufacturers relating to the availability of compatible thermostatic switches in the commercial market. The following are the pertinent characteristics of the replacement thermostatic switch, which does not need to fully conform to MIL-PRF-24236/25C.
The thermostatic switch must provide an output consisting of a switch contact opening.  The contact opening temperature minimum is 123 degrees F  and the maximum is 134 degrees F. The contacts must be rated at 1.5 Amperes (inductive) for 115 VAC, 60 Hz. The switch must screw into a one half inch threaded hole with 0.5-14 threads. It must have a hexagonal section on the switch body to tighten the switch with a wrench. The temperature probe section of the switch must not exceed 1.53 inches long, measured from the under surface of the hexagonal section. The probe diameter must not exceed 0.665 inches except at the threads. The leads must be AWG No. 18 wire and must be at least 11.5 inches long. The switch must withstand temperatures from negative 31 degrees F to 250 degrees F. The minimum dielectric withstanding voltage is 350 VAC at 11,000 feet ASL.
The NWS will not fund the development of a new design to support this requirement.  Responses to this market survey should only include products that support all stated requirements in a current commercially-available configuration, or could be made fully compliant through minor modifications.  Responses to this market survey must include the device manufacturer, a product description with performance parameters, a statement regarding current availability and lead time, a statement describing any required modifications, and the estimated cost of the product including any required modifications.  These cost estimates must include cost for 200 production units, and the cost to provide one test item for evaluation. This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes. Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  The NWS will use the results of this RFI to estimate expected cost and identify possible sources to support this future requirement.  Any contractors doing business with the Government must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry.  The web site is http://www.ccr.gov/ .  
All information should be submitted in writing to: Kelly Rima, U.S. Dept. of Commerce/NOAA/MRAD, Acquisition Division, MC3, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO  80305 no later than December 20, 2006.  No telephone calls will be accepted or returned.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is hereby soliciting information about potential  sources capable of providing the agency with a rapid, automated, multi-analyte test system to identify classes of antimicrobial drugs such as tetracyclines, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, phenicols, and sulfonamides.  The system will be used to identify those animals whose tissues will be tested by chemical methods to quantify and confirm specific compounds in the classes identified.   The product will be used to detect controlled or banned residues in food animal tissues as provided under the code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Parts 530 and 556, Title 40 and the Federal Meat Inspections Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act and the Egg Products Inspection Act.  Last calendar year, FSIS ran approximately 10,000 tests for antibiotic residues.  Although FSIS cannot identify how many tests will be needed in the future, this figure should be used as a guide when providing price estimates in response to this sources sought synopsis.   

(1) Description of Requirement:  

The automated test system shall screen for antimicrobial residue classes in tissues or tissue extracts.  Specific residue classes to be identified for further testing shall include those in the sulfonamide group, tetracyclines, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, phenicols, macrolides, and other antimicrobials. The test must differentiate each of these drug classes when present in food animal tissue.  The test system must have the capability to perform multi-analyte testing on single individual samples.  The test system must have the ability to detect down to the part-per-billion (ppb) level for select drugs.   The Contractor will be responsible for Quality Assurance functions of the project.  Contractor personnel must possess extensive knowledge of laboratory procedures and laboratory safety practices.  

(2) Specific Requirements:  

The potential suppliers will need to describe the method used to determine the limits of detection, and the limits of detection for each drug tested.  A complete description of the procedure, along with estimated times required per analysis, should also be submitted.   

 (3) Interested respondents should be aware that they may be required to provide test validation data based on the following parameters. Four months will be provided to produce such a data package. The test system must be validated for use with the tissue matrices used for FSIS regulatory testing, which are: liver, kidney and muscle tissues or tissue extracts from cattle, swine, poultry and eggs.  Test system validation results must be provided to FSIS.   FSIS Regulatory testing information can be located at the following websites:   

Chemistry lab guidebook-
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/science/Chemistry_Lab_Guidebook/index.asp.    

Micro lab guidebook-
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Science/Microbiological_Lab_Guidebook/index.asp

(4) Response Requirements-Technical:

Interested respondents having the specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  Discuss the proposed testing equipment, procedures, methods, options or technologies you believe would benefit FSIS. The respondent needs to submit a description of the protocol used to determine the limits of detection, which should reflect tests run in the appropriate matrices (not water or buffer).  

Submissions shall not exceed ten pages (8 a half X 11) not including test data.  Information submitted to FSIS in response to this Sources Sought will be treated as strictly proprietary unless otherwise indicated.  

If validation data should be required it must include sensitivity, specificity, limits of detection, limits of quantitation, ruggedness and method uncertainty.  The test must be on a scientifically recognized platform such as a 96-well plate or biochip format and be fully automated for ease of use.  The test system must be such that one person can analyze one or more batches of samples within a standard work day, or automated for overnight analysis.  The respondent shall generate or submit data on a range of drugs from each compound class. As mentioned above the respondent should plan on completing the data package in four months if so required.  

It is emphasized that this Sources Sought notice is for information only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  No solicitation exists; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.   Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information they provide.  No contract award will be made on the basis of the responses received; however, the information will be used in FSIS?s assessment of capable sources.     

(4) Pricing:

Cost will be reviewed along with technical ability.  Respondents are asked to provide pricing information.

Ideally, the UGS are small, low cost and robust, and are expected to last in the field for extended periods of time after deployment. They are capable of transmitting target information back to a remote op erator. These devices could be used to perform various mission tasks including perimeter defense, border patrol and surveillance, target acquisition, and situation awareness.  UGS Devices consist of a battery-powered, single or multiple co-located sensors,  with signal processing capability to analyze target characteristics, and transmit target recognition information to a remote monitoring location. UGS can be deployed by one of many different techniques.  The operational life of UGS can be greatly extended  with smart power management, which can extend the useful life of the device beyond that of normal, continuous operation.  Currently the U.S. military uses a variety of unattended sensor for reconnaissance and detection.  These sensors are crucial to savin g lives and situational awareness.  Currently sensors are powered by military battery technology.  In many cases the available batteries only power the sensor for a limited amount of time, requiring individual to return to the sensor to change out the powe r source.  This may be in very remote and sometime dangerous situations.  An ideal mission for an unattended aground sensor would be operation without re-supply for 30-60 days.   The U.S Army CERDEC is interested in determining companies that have the capa bility to develop a fuel cell power source for unattended ground sensors.  The goal of the program would be to develop a lightweight, silent, fuel cell system capable of providing between 5 and 10Watts of power (depending on sensor chosen).  The fuel cell system should be designed to power the sensor unattended for 30-60 days without refuel.  Commercial firms shall select a military sensor or several military sensors and submit an analysis of capability and benefit in comparison with currently used battery technology. The CERDEC Power Technology Branch is interested in obtaining white papers, not exceeding 10 pages in length, describing the contractor's experience in design, development, fabrication and testing of fuel cell power source for unattended ground  sensors, detailed specifications of their power source, organizational capabilities, and a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit cost for potential future government procurements. Technical Information submitted should include: Fuel cell technology proposed  and fuel type; size and weight of the system with fuel and without fuel; overall power output; energy density of the system; size and weight of fuel required for 30-60 day mission duration; volume and form factor; and analysis of benefit over current batt eries used.  The data received in response to this RFI is for information purposes only and does not mandate or impose requirements. It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government. However, we recognize that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. If so, clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum. All responses to this market research shall be submitted within 30 calendar days of th e date of this announcement. Responses must be submitted via electronic mail to Ms. Elizabeth Bostic, Project Engineer at elizabeth.bostic@armypower.army.mil. All questions of a technical nature should be directed to Ms. Bostic the above email address.  Al l questions of a contractual nature shall be directed to Ms. Patricia Davis, Contracting Officer at pat.davis@cacw.army.mil. No telephonic inquiries or requests  will be honored. Please reference solicitation number W909MY-07-R-PUGS in all request for information and in the White Paper submission.  See note 26.

2.03	UPS MODULE

A. 	DESCRIPTION
	
The UPS module shall be a single conversion design. The input to the UPS module shall be connected to an electrically operated input breaker. The output of the breaker shall connect to the input of the static disconnect switch and the static bypass switch. The output of the static disconnect switch shall connect to the line side of a line inductor. The load side of the line inductor shall be connected to the utility side of UPS converter. The other side of the UPS converter shall connect to the DC bus of the UPS module. The DC bus shall connect to 4 flywheel energy storage modules (FES). The load side of the line inductor shall also be connected to the load side of the static bypass switch and to the output of the UPS module. The UPS module shall have the space and means to include a 1600 amp output circuit breaker. 


B.	OPERATION

1.	The UPS shall operate continuously while maintaining specified output power quality whenever the AC input power is within specified steady state limits. The UPS shall operate properly from turbo-charged diesel generator sets equipped with electronic isochronous governors and three-phase sensing voltage regulators provided the generator sets are rated to support the critical load at rated UPS power plus UPS losses and recharging power for the FES. The UPS shall not require over sizing of engine generator sets to accommodate UPS input harmonics. The UPS shall be compatible with the Caterpillar 2250 generator set.

2.	In normal mode operation, the input breaker, static disconnect switch, and output breaker are closed and the static bypass switch is open. The input source supplies real power to the UPS module to support the load and to keep the energy storage charged. The utility converter shall exchange reactive current through the line inductor to regulate the output voltage. The utility converter shall also supply reactive current and harmonic current required by the load. The static disconnect switch shall be phase controlled to block reverse power from flowing from the utility converters to the input source. UPS output voltage shall remain within 10 degrees of the input voltage during steady state operation at all load levels between no load and full load and shall not deviate by more than 15 degrees at the overload level that triggers an instantaneous transfer to bypass. It shall not be necessary for the UPS to draw power from the FES modules to support 100% step loads in normal mode operation. 

3.	When input frequency or voltage deviates outside pre-determined limits, the static disconnect switch and input circuit breaker shall open. At the same time the utility converter shall draw power from the FES modules to maintain uninterrupted power to the load within specified tolerances. The load shall continue to be supplied power from the FES until they are fully discharged or until the input returns within specified tolerances and the UPS resynchronizes, reconnects and ramps the load back onto the supply. The UPS shall resynchronize in the direction of the smaller angular difference and the maximum frequency slew rate shall be adjustable. The default slew rate shall be one Hz per second and shall accomplish resynchronization in less than 2.5 seconds when the frequency of the returned source is the same as the frequency prior to the input disturbance. The synchronization process shall not use phase jumps that appear to the load as high slew rate frequency changes.  When the UPS module reconnects to the input the current walk-in shall be linear and without steps. 
4.	If the input does not return to within normal limits before the stored energy in exhausted, or if the UPS has not resynchronized to the input one of the following customer selectable choices shall occur:

a.	The UPS shall shut down without damage or clearing fuses and the output voltage shall cleanly transition to zero without spikes or surges.  This shall be the default setting.

b.	An alternate firmware setting shall cause the UPS to attempt to maintain power to the load by making a break transfer to bypass if the bypass source is available. In this case, the Converters shall shut down and the bypass shall turn on after a programmable delay provided the bypass source is within limits specified herein. The delay shall be programmable over a minimum range of 0 seconds to 2 seconds. 


5.	When the UPS has walked in following reconnection to the utility source or following a discharge of stored energy for any reason, the UPS shall recharge the FES modules. The recharge current shall ramp up to a level corresponding to the preset, programmable recharge rate and, when the flywheels approach full charge the recharge current shall ramp down. The recharge power shall not be stepped on and off. The recharging current limit shall be set independently of the input current limit. However, if the input current limit is reached, recharging shall be reduced as required until it reaches the minimum allowable level. The maximum recharge rate shall be one that results in additional input current less than 20% of nominal full load input current. The maximum recharge setting shall allow the minimum flywheel configuration to be recharged in less than 5 minutes with 2 FES modules. The minimum allowable recharge rate shall increase the full load input current by less than 10% with 2 FES modules.

6.	An alternate recharging mode shall be initiated by the Automatic Transfer Switch potential-free contact closure. This contact closure activates an alternate set of operating parameters (diesel operation, e.g.) for the UPS. Alternate charging current and input current limit, among other parameters, are activated by this contact when set in the field configurable firmware settings. Other parameters that may have alternate settings activated by this external input shall include, without limitation, walk-in rate, slew rate, input voltage window, and input frequency window.

7.	The bypass shall be designed for automatic and manually initiated, automatically executed operation. Transfers to bypass shall occur without interruption of load current or voltage except when a break transfer upon complete discharge is selected as outlined above. The UPS shall automatically transfer to bypass in normal mode or discharge mode if it is overloaded in excess of specified time-load profile limits, if the output voltage deviates beyond specified parameters or if an internal failure occurs that will imminently render the UPS unable to support the load. Bypass transfer shall be inhibited whenever programmable, preset conditions are not met. Those conditions shall include the following:

a. 	Phase differential between bypass source and UPS output less than 15 degrees as a default value with a programmable range from 15 degrees to 179 degrees. 

b. 	Frequency differential between Bypass source and UPS output less than 0.5 Hz as a default with a programmable range of 0.5 Hz to 2 Hz. 

c. 	Voltage differential between UPS output and bypass source of +10% to -15% and programmable to smaller differential values.

8.	The number of re-transfers from bypass to UPS in any 10-minute period due to overload conditions shall be programmable from 0 to 3. If the maximum number or retransfers is reached, the UPS shall remain in bypass on the next transfer and shall require operator intervention at the UPS control panel to return to normal mode operation. Manual transfers to bypass shall be inhibited unless the bypass is within specified parameters and is synchronized to the output with less than 15 degrees phase differential. 

9.	Means shall be provided to prevent a shorted SCR condition of the static bypass switch or static disconnect switch from back feeding power from the UPS to the input when the input source has failed (anti-backfeed protection).  Indication shall be provided whenever the anti-backfeed protection is activated to indicate a shorted SCR.  When the anti-backfeed protection is activated, the input circuit breaker shall be opened whenever an input source failure is detected. Stand-alone anti-backfeed logic shall prevent a shorted SCR from connecting UPS output power to a failed utility even if the primary UPS logic fails.  

10.	The UPS controls shall be programmable for either automatic or manual starting. It shall be possible to start the UPS, charge the energy storage and check the UPS for correct internal operation without energizing the output. The customer may choose manual or automatic restart operation via a field selectable firmware setting. In manual mode operator intervention shall be required to start the UPS and energize the output. In automatic mode, the UPS shall start and energize the load automatically when it detects input power within specified tolerances. In automatic mode the UPS shall energize the output via bypass while the UPS starts. The UPS shall then transfer automatically from bypass to normal mode operation.

11.	For service purposes means shall be included to brake the flywheels to a stop from full speed in less than 30 minutes. 

	
C.	UPS MODULE ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS

1.	The UPS module shall have built in surge suppression. Surge suppressors shall have indicators to detect when the devices are no longer capable of providing surge suppression

2.	The UPS Module shall be protected against overloads and short circuits on its output. All power semiconductor devices shall have appropriate over current protection and shall have appropriate current limiting means to prevent cascading failures. Extensive internal monitoring and diagnostics shall be included to minimize UPS damage from internal failures.

3.	The UPS Module shall have a withstand rating of at least 65,000 amps.
A complete copy of the specifications is available upon request by submitting an email request to the attention of JoAnna Black at jblack@bnl.gov.  Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
   
 (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments;

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

                                   EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

STATEMENT OF WORK
ONLINE ORDER ENTRY SOFTWARE FOR APFO IMAGERY ARCHIVE

PROJECT SUMMARY
In September 2005, USDA began providing metadata through APFO to Geospatial One Stop (GOS) in compliance with one of 12 Presidential Initiatives. Within the same time frame, APFO established web services specifically in support of GOS. Today, as a critical next step to expanding the value of its imagery archive and its capability to rapidly deliver imagery orders, the APFO has a requirement to integrate a web based online order entry process with the GOS and the APFO Data Provisioning System (EarthWhere). This expanded functionality will build upon the solid technology and infrastructure currently in place at the APFO, and leverage GOS as a primary entry point for all users. In the current production environment, APFO sales operations personnel determine coverage for customer requested orders quickly and efficiently by using their EarthWhere Data Provisioning System interface. This system leverages a powerful data catalog to locate all spatial imagery data within a given Area of Interest (AOI), enabling Sales Operations to process and deliver order requests in a fraction of the time required previously. It is APFO's intent to implement an easy-to-use Online Order Entry interface via a web enabled "Aerial Imagery Web Portal?, which extends this capability to external users, providing capabilities that do not currently exist and expanding availability to Federal, State and public customers. Customers would be able to gain access to the Order Entry System from the APFO home page on the web, Geospatial One Stop and any other web page with 
a link to the web portal. The APFO Online Order Entry web portal will take advantage of the existing APFO technical infrastructure which includes a Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) system data archive, the EarthWhere spatial data provisioning system, the APFO Work Order Entry System and the Media Services Production System.  As additional data sets are cataloged, the associated imagery or imagery products can easily be made available for ordering.
CAPABILITIES: The APFO Online Order Entry Software shall address the following capabilities: A. Order Entry -- Specify a county and order all NAIP quarter quadrants for that county, Specify a county and order an existing compressed county mosaic for that county, Limit the size of orders based upon APFO business rules; B. Order submittal -- Validate ordered products, Allow changes to orders, Save and retrieve orders and Submit orders; C. Order processing/delivery -- Provide capability to process orders according to size or requested media type. Orders are automatically processed and output via APFO media services; D. Order notification -- Notify customers when the status of their order changes; E. Account management -- Register users, Limit access to appropriate data and 
Enable and disable user accounts. 
SUMMARY: The APFO Online Order Entry Software will include: A. An Aerial Imagery Web Portal that can be accessed from the Geospatial One Stop, APFO home page, other USDA web sites, etc.; B. An easy-to-use web interface to order products from the APFO imagery archive; C. Integration with APFO media services for order processing and delivery; D. Ability to process orders based upon APFO business rules of access rights, file sizes, etc.

APFO ONLINE ORDER ENTRY SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The APFO requires a web based order entry software fully integrated with the Geospatial One Stop (GOS) and the APFO Data Provisioning System (EarthWhere). The software system shall be designed to enhance the value of APFO's imagery archive and it's capability to deliver imagery orders in a timely manner. In the current APFO production environment, access to the APFO Data Provisioning System (EarthWhere) is done mainly through its sales operations. By implementing an easy-to-use Online Order Entry interface via a web enabled Aerial Imagery Web Portal, the APFO can extend this capability to external users, providing capabilities that do not currently exist and expanding availability to Federal, State, and public customers. Processes and technology currently in place are well positioned for integration with order entry, but additional features required include: A. Support for debit and credit card order entry; B. Interfacing to the APFO Work Order Entry System (WOES); C. Thresholds for order size and data delivery options; D. Types of products to be made available for ordering; E. Provisioning and ingesting derivative products; and F. FGDC metadata for derivative products. The APFO Online Order Entry web portal will be based upon the existing APFO technical infrastructure which includes a Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) system data archive, the EarthWhere spatial data provisioning system, the APFO Work Order Entry System and the Media Services Production System. As additional data sets are cataloged, the associated imagery or imagery products can easily be made available for ordering.

ONLINE ORDER ENTRY CONSTRAINTS
When ordering products a user will be able to do the following: A. Specify a county and order all NAIP quarter quadrants for that county; B. Specify a county and order a compressed county mosaic for that county; C. Orders will be limited to three counties or a total output imagery size of 210GB, whichever comes first. 

FUNCTIONALITY BREAKDOWN FOR APFO ONLINE ORDER ENTRY
Using a phase rollout approach, Online Order Entry will be made available to designated partners and selected FSA Service Centers. This initial group will pilot the new web portal, which will provide the APFO with necessary feedback to plan and prepare for a larger, phased rollout.

ORDER ENTRY: In Order Entry, users will sign into the system, search for products, add products to their order and proceed to checkout. The function to enter an order should include the following capabilities: 
1. Log into the Order Entry web portal. To place an order in APFO Online Order Entry a user must log in. The Order Entry system will have to validate the user's login credentials against both WOES and EarthWhere under the following rules: A. If the customer has a valid account, they can proceed to shop; B. If a customer does not exist, the system will allow them to enter the necessary details and pass this information along to the APFO for account setup. When their account has been set up, the system will notify them; C. If a customer has an account but the password has expired, they should have the ability to create a new password, based upon APFO business rules, or contact the APFO for help.
2. Upload a shape file to define an area of interest. The system will provide the following: A. The ability to search the APFO data catalog and return the results of the search to the customer; B. Define what data a user is authorized to see and only provide results that meet this criterion; C. The ability for a customer to validate that the products available within the AOI are what they want to order. D. The ability to add products within an AOI to a "shopping cart".
3. Search for products when no AOI exists. The system will provide the following: A. The ability for a user to define an AOI; B. The ability to search the APFO data catalog and return the results of the search to the customer; C. The ability for a user to validate that the products available within the AOI are what they want to order; D. The ability to add products within an AOI to a "shopping cart". 
4. Retrieve an order that was saved previously. If a customer saved an order in a previous session, they shall have the ability to retrieve the order in a later session.  
5. Proceed to "checkout" when shopping is complete. When a customer is done shopping, the system will allow them to proceed to "checkout", where they will have the ability to submit their order for processing and shipment. 

ORDER SUBMISSION: In order submission, the system will estimate the time to fulfill an order, price the order and present it to the user for review. Users will be able to review their order, change their order, save the order, cancel the order or submit it for processing and delivery. The function that enables users to submit an order should include the following capabilities:
1. Estimate time to process and order. The system will need to estimate the time required to process an order and have it ready for delivery. This will require an understanding of the HSM system and data structures, the EarthWhere provisioning system, WOES and the Media Services production system.
2. Estimate cost of order. This will require communicating information from the EarthWhere provisioning system to WOES.  Interfacing with WOES will be necessary for billing and reporting.
3. Present order for review and approval. The online order entry system will need the ability to present the details of an order for review by the customer before placing the order. The system shall provide the following: A. Allow the customer to add or remove products from an order; B. Allow the customer to save an order without submitting it, for retrieval at a later time; C. The ability to verify that funds are available for a billable order; D. The ability to interface with EarthWhere and WOES to create a work order; E. The ability to send an order submitted acknowledgement to the customer.

ORDER PROCESSING AND DELIVERY: The order entry system will have to integrate with the EarthWhere provisioning system and the HSM data archive to successfully process orders. The function that processes and delivers a customer's order should include the following capabilities:
1. Determine most efficient way to process order. The system should have the ability to analyze an order, determine the most efficient way to process it and then queue the job for processing. Some jobs may require special handling. 
Most jobs should be able to be processed automatically, without any special handling. The system shall provide the following: A. Based upon the size of an order and APFO business rules, determine if it should be output to CD, DVD or Firewire drive; B. Based upon the size of an order, determine if it can be placed in an automated queue or a manual queue for special handling by APFO delivery personnel.
2. Stage job for processing. The system will need to pass information between the EarthWhere provisioning system and the HSM system, as to what products are contained in an order, and then wait for the data to be staged before continuing with order processing.
3. Notify order has been processed. When an order has completed processing, it will need the ability to notify the customer that their order has been processed. If an order fails, internal notifications will be needed so APFO personnel can address the issue and complete the order processing and delivery.

CUSTOMER ACCOUNT CREATION: Customer accounts exist in both the EarthWhere and WOES systems. The function that allows customers to be registered so that they can shop in the online order entry system should provide the following capabilities: A. The ability to request and capture customer information so that APFO personnel can create a user account in their Work Order Entry System and in EarthWhere; B. The ability to add a group of customers in batch. An example of adding a group of users would be adding a group of FSA county GIS coordinators; C. The ability to identify new users and send a welcome message to them when their account has been created and activated.

ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT: The function that supports account management should provide the following capabilities: A. The ability to notify users within a group when new data has been ingested and is available in their area of interest. This will require an understanding of how the APFO Data Provisioning System organizes users, groups and the data sources they are allowed to see; B. The ability of the system to expire passwords based upon APFO business rules; C. The ability for a user to specify a new password provided their account has not been disabled; D. The ability to review customer accounts and disable them, based upon APFO business rules; E. The ability to review disabled customer accounts and enable them, based upon APFO business rules.

TRAINING AND SUPPORT: The Contractor shall provide training to specified APFO employees in the installation and operation of the software and its management tools. The Contractor shall provide support in the form of technical advise, software patches, and upgrades.  This shall be for an initial period of one (1) year, beginning at the date of installation.

QUESTIONS FROM VENDORS ABOUT SOLICITATION #H92239-07-T-0005
1)	Would you rather use an Existing Facility or a Custom Made Facility for your specific request?  Prefer an existing facility to facilitate starting the contract in Dec/Jan timeframe.

2)	Would the Government provide the 5.56 M4 rounds???  Yes, there is no requirement for the vendor to provide 5.56 mm rounds.

3)	The requirement indicates that the contractor will be required to supply 130,000 rounds of 9mm ammo. As such, would the contractor be required to stock the full quantity should they be given the contract OR on a month to month basis depending on how many attendees per course?  There is no requirement for the vendor to stock ahead.  Each individual task order will indicate the amounts required per class.


4)	Transportation - will the attendees be driving to the training facility from where they're stationed? We need to know if we should factor the cost of transportation and this will also help us decide on which choice of lodging we should include in our response. Transportation to and from the training site will be a Government incurred expense.

  5)  Weapons & Ammo Storage - We have had Government units come through our 
  range/facility in the past and all weapons are essentially stored in the administrative                     building/classroom with an armed security guard throughout the evening. Will this    suffice and meet your requirement?  A vendor provided armed security guard in the administrative building/classroom will suffice.		

6)	EMOE - We noted the requirement for Advance Ballistic & Mechanical Breaching,        however, will there be any need for EMOE (Explosive Method/s Of Entry)? We will need to factor this into our cost if it is needed.    No.

    7)  We always price our training based on a minimum of 8 attendees. Will this 
         be a problem for you?  Yes, because we will have some classes with 6 students.  

8)	CQB section in this case is for armed or unarmed fighting?  Armed.

9)	In the ?STATEMENT OF WORK: SCOPE? last lines. ?The contractor shall provide 9MM ammunition?? Next it says ?The government will provide 230,000 rounds of 9mm ammo? Which one is Correct?  Both, contractor will provide 130,000 rounds of 9mm; government will provide 230,000 rounds or 9mm.

10)	 Will the government supply vehicles?  Government will provide vehicles for transportation to and from the training site.  Vendor will provide vehicles for training.

11)	 Will the Government provide medic? Yes, the Government will have a medic/combat lifesaver on station, but the vendor is responsible for range/training medical plan IAW Local/State Law (evacuation procedures).

12)	 Gunsmith issues. Will gov?t provide extra parts and/or firearms in case of    malfunction?  Yes.

13)	 Please specify night vision types, brand names in use by the unit.  PVS 14, PEQ 2, Aim Point, EOTECH.

14)	 Will the Government supply the devices for the trainees?  What devices?  We will provide NVGs and weapons. 
   
15)	 Will the Government provide vehicles for training? If yes, please specify. No.

16)	 AMOUNT scenarios. Please be specific.  Scenarios should include at a minimum Room clearing, multiple rooms, multiple breach points.

17)	 Is the 15-day training in December, a three consecutive 5-day training?  There is no 15-day training schedule, all training will be conducted in 5 days as per paragraph 1 of the Statement of Work.  There will be 12 personnel for Dec.

18)	 If so, will trainees be different in each 5-day training?  No.

19 )  The contractor will be providing 130,000 rounds of Pistol Ammunition.  What type of 9mm ammunition is acceptable/unacceptable for your weapons (Federal Ball 115gr, Winchester Frangible, etc.)?  DODIC: A363, CTG 9mm Ball.
 
20)   Will you be bringing your own Mechanical Breaching tools?  No.  Or does the solicitation only refer to Shotgun Breaching?  If so, will you be bringing your own shotgun breaching ammunition or is the contractor required to provide?  Solicitation refers to both mechanical and shotgun breaching.  Vendor will be responsible for 500 rounds of 12 Gauge Breaching F/Autox104 shotgun ammo.
 
21)   What type of Advanced Driver Training / Off-Road Driver Training will the participants have completed prior to training commencing?  I utilize a 23-Mile off-road Live-Fire Convoy Course which requires driver skill but could incorporate minimum basic skills prior to conducting the live-fire portion of the course.   Approximately half of the participants will have completed Mobile Force Protection phase 1 Driver?s training.
