<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA desires industry participation in the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology Program.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102 (d) (2).  Proposal submission is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  Responses from all responsible sources will be considered.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and small, HUBzone small disadvantaged, and women owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this BAA is 541710 with the small business size of 1000 employees.  REQUIREMENTS:  Responses to this announcement are sought to develop an advanced technology base for rocket propulsion concepts and components aimed at supporting the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program.  Although not mandatory, it is highly recommended that a prospective offeror have either a government coordinated Advance Rocket Propulsion Plan (ARPP), or develop an ARPP prior to or in conjunction with abstract submittal, or have a documented working relationship with a company possessing a government coordinated ARPP to ensure IHPRPT relevance of any proposed technology.  Information regarding the IHPRPT program in general and the ARPP process are available from Mr. Scott Fuller, NAWCWD, 760-939-7481, FullerST@navair.navy.mil .  The Navy wishes to identify and explore innovative and new concepts, principals, or processes in the area of tactical solid rocket motor propulsion technology.  Proposed concepts and technologies can address all components of a solid rocket motor system or individual components (structure, nozzle, propellant, insulation materials, thrust management devices, [TVC], etc).  Proposals can address either surface launched or air launched tactical missile applications.  The proposed technologies should address IHPRPT Phase II or Phase III goals for increasing delivered energy and mass fraction.  However, individual technologies do not have to meet IHPRPT Phase II/III goals by themselves.  A fusion of individual technologies is desired for insertion into an IHPRPT Phase II/III tactical solid rocket motor demonstrator.  Individual proposals are desired in the following ranges:  Total funding is estimated at $750,000 - $2,000,000 per award with a period of performance 2 - 4 years.   INSTRUCTIONS:  This BAA consists of two separate steps.  Step 1 requires the submission of proposal abstracts and Step 2 requires full proposals.  Abstracts are initially sought to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror in preparing full technical and cost proposals without an initial assessment of the technical feasibility of the concept.  Step 1 - Proposal abstracts should be limited to 2 pages plus 1 cover page.  Abstracts shall identify the following: (1) BAA number N68936-02-R-0051, BAA title and date, title of abstract;  (2) Organization name;  (3) Other team members, if any, and type of business for each;  (4) Technical Points of contact (including phone, fax, and e-mail information);  (5) Administrative point of contact;  (6) Overview of the proposed work to include:  A clear discussion of the concept and associated technologies being proposed; an estimated timeframe for project completion; a brief description of the facilities involved, and brief resume of the principal investigator(s); and (7) a yearly rough order of cost magnitude of price including major cost drivers.  The original and two copies of the Step 1 proposal abstracts should be submitted by 4PM PST, May 28, 2002 to Commander, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 210000D, Bldg. 02483, Attn: J. Manley, 1 Administration Circle, China Lake, CA 93555-6100.  Any proposal abstracts received after this cutoff time may not be reviewed in the initial cycle of technical reviews. Therefore, awards based on abstracts received after the cutoff time will be based on the available amount of funding.  All abstracts will be acknowledged via e-mail.  Abstracts will not be returned after evaluation.  Offerors submitting the most promising abstracts will be encouraged to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their abstract submission.  However, any such encouragement does not assure a subsequent award.  Any offeror may submit a full proposal even if its abstract was not identified as promising or if no abstract was submitted.  Abstract evaluations will consist of a scientific and engineering assessment in accordance with the evaluation criteria described below.  STEP 2:  Full proposals shall consist of two separate sections, one for Technical and another for Cost.  Both of these sections shall reference the BAA number and include the offeror's project title.  Titles given to the abstracts/proposals should be descriptive of the work they cover and not merely a copy of this solicitation.  The technical portion of the full proposal should include the following: (1) The proposal's technical goals, approach, and expected results; (2) Description of past performance on similar efforts with dollar values, contacts, and contact phone numbers.  Past performance information will also include cost/price performance information including those internal controls that ensured the offeror did not exceed the cost/price.  If costs were exceeded or prices were adjusted, provide the reasons and state the systemic improvement actions taken and current controls now in-place to prevent future recurrences;  (3) Schedule and deliverables; (4) Statement of Work (SOW) that discusses the specific tasks to be accomplished, tied to the specific approach and goals of the project (should not include any proprietary information to allow for incorporation into a contract award); and (5) Resumes of the principal investigator and other key personnel.  The cost portion of the proposal should fully segregate costs by cost category and should include the following cost items, if appropriate:  direct labor, fringe benefits, indirect labor, materials, subcontracts, travel and other direct costs, G&A, cost of money, and fixed fee.  Direct labor should show each individual labor category with associated hours and specific unburdened labor rate.  All indirect costs (including fringe, indirect labor, G&A, and COM) should show base amount and rate.  Details/explanation of all other cost items should be given in this section.  The cost section should be accompanied by a completed certification package entitled "Representations and Certifications for Contracts".   This certification package can be obtained from Jerry Manley by email at manleyjm@navair.navy.mil.  A Small Business Subcontracting Plan prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 must accompany contract proposals (full proposals) that exceed $500,000 submitted by all large businesses.   The original and 2 copies of each proposal shall be submitted to Commander, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 210000D, Bldg. 02483, Attn: J. Manley, 1 Administration Circle, China Lake, CA 93555-6100.  The Government reserves the right to select for contract award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Responses to this announcement should be unclassified.  All proprietary portions of the abstract shall be clearly identified and will be treated in the strictest confidence.  EVALUATION CRITERIA - A scientific and engineering evaluation will be conducted on all proposals received.  The purpose of this evaluation is to determine the relative merit of the technical approach proposed in response to this announcement.  This evaluation shall consider technical aspects and cost as related to technical effort.  The same criteria will be used for the abstracts and the full proposals.  The technical evaluation area will be ranked as first priority in the evaluation.  The cost area, while considered substantial, will be second in priority.  The technical evaluation will be based on the following criteria.  Criteria 1 and 2 are of equal importance to each other and most important in the technical area.  Criteria 3, 4, and 5 are also of equal importance to each other, but are of less importance than criteria 1 and 2.  The Technical area criteria are:  1. Soundness of offeror's technical approach with regards to feasibility of the project, probability of the technology being a viable candidate for selection/application into an operational system, and understanding the scope of the technical effort.  2.  Past Performance as it relates to demonstrated past/present performance, delivery schedule performance, and cost/price performance.  3.  Relevance of the proposed effort to the achievement/demonstration of the goals of the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology program.  4.  Innovation and creativity of the proposed solution to meeting the technical objectives as stated.  5.  Capability of the offeror to successfully accomplish the proposed effort, which includes the availability of the necessary resources such as experienced and competent technical and management personnel, and the availability, from any source, of required laboratory, shop, and test facilities.  Organization and clarity of information are critical to all of the evaluation criteria for both abstract and the full proposal.  Cost, which includes consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles, and cost elements as they relate to the technical effort are the second evaluation area.  The cost evaluation criterion consists of realism and reasonableness of proposed costs.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the abstracts and proposals.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Anticipated type of contract to be awarded is cost-plus-fixed-fee.  Anticipated award dates range from November through December 2002.  Offerors should state that their proposals would be valid for 180 days from submission.  This BAA is open for one year from the issuance date of this announcement and proposals will be given consideration during this period.  However, as stated previously, submission of abstracts by the initial cutoff time will ensure technical review with consideration of current allotted funding profiles.  The cost of preparing abstracts and proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract.  The Navy reserves the right to amend this BAA to allow for subsequent submission dates for abstracts.  This announcement constitutes the only published solicitation for this requirement.  A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will not be issued.  Request for Proposal letters will be sent only to those offerors participating in Step 1 and selected in accordance with the abstract evaluation criteria.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published.  Note:  Offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  All responsible sources may submit an abstract and proposal that shall be considered.

<DESC>EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis the acceleration of hours on an existing contract with The Cadmus Group, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Contract 68-D-01-006 was awarded on 6/27/01 to The Cadmus Group on a competitive basis for a total of 75,800 level of effort hours for a base and three (3) 12-month optional periods.  Since award of that contract, the program's requirements have changed and the level of effort is required at an accelerated pace.  Additional hours are not being added, but the 75,800 initial hours will be utilized over a shorter time frame [a 15-month base period and two optional periods, i.e., one for 12 months and one for 6 months).  The accelerated schedule is required primarily to continue support for the Children's Health program which has become a higher priority than previously anticipated, thus requiring more contract support/hours than is available under the current contract structure.  Other work supported under the current contract includes the IAQ Tools for Schools, Smoke Free Homes Pledge Campaign, the asthma education work, and radon work.  This accelerated usage of the level of effort can only be provided by The Cadmus Group because they were the successful offeror for the existing contract and to ensure the continuity of services for work that has been initiated under the current base period of this contract.  If any firm feels this acceleration of the level of effort of this contract is not warranted, you may respond within 15 days of this notice to Karen Watson at the above address.  Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the requirement.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine that another qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, negotiations will be held with The Cadmus Group for the acceleration of the level of effort of their existing contract.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) at Orlando, FL, has identified a requirement to develop conceptual and preliminary designs for the Battle Stations Exercise.  The overall objective of the Battle Stations Program is to provide the Navy?s recruits with the culminating training exercise in the final phase of their training. This entire Battle Stations Exercise will be comprised of specified events (e.g., move aboard a ship) and scenarios (e.g., small boat attack) that push recruits to their physical, mental and emotional limits, requiring them to draw on every aspect of their basic training curriculum. The recruits must utilize the skills and knowledge they obtained during recruit training in an environment that approximates the stressors that can be encountered in the operational shipboard environment The Battle Station Program will be done in a two contract strategy, the first phase being for the creative concept and design of the events and scenarios being supported by NAWCTSD, and the second phase being for the construction and implementation of the Battle Station Exercise Facility being supported by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) at Great Lakes, IL.  The first contract is expected to be awarded in August 2002 with an estimated 10 month period of performance for approximately $1.5 million (excluding options) and the second contract is expected to be awarded first quarter of FY04 for approximately $50 - $55 million.  This synopsis applies to the first phase contract for the Battle Station Program.  The concept design contract will provide events and scenarios designs for the Battle Stations Exercise that take advantage of the entertainment industry?s ability to create imaginative and convincing experiences.  Further objectives for phase one consist of development, refinement and formalization of the conceptual design criteria for the production equipment to include:  Operational Requirement Considerations; Logistics Elements; Building Design Interface Considerations; and Non-proprietary procurement specifications for all production equipment. The basic award of phase one will be a Firm Fixed Price type contract awarded using a trade-off basis with a follow-on post contract support services option, exercised if required.  NAWCTSD seeks to competitively award this contract on a 100% small business set-aside (See Note #1).  The Government anticipates that a pre-proposal conference/site visit at Great Lakes Recruit Training Center, IL will be held on or about 21 May 2002.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) at Orlando, FL, has identified a requirement to develop conceptual and preliminary designs for the Battle Stations Exercise.  The overall objective of the Battle Stations Program is to provide the Navy?s recruits with the culminating training exercise in the final phase of their training. This entire Battle Stations Exercise will be comprised of specified events (e.g., move aboard a ship) and scenarios (e.g., small boat attack) that push recruits to their physical, mental and emotional limits, requiring them to draw on every aspect of their basic training curriculum. The recruits must utilize the skills and knowledge they obtained during recruit training in an environment that approximates the stressors that can be encountered in the operational shipboard environment The Battle Station Program will be done in a two contract strategy, the first phase being for the creative concept and design of the events and scenarios being supported by NAWCTSD, and the second phase being for the construction and implementation of the Battle Station Exercise Facility being supported by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) at Great Lakes, IL.  The first contract is expected to be awarded in August 2002 with an estimated 10 month period of performance for approximately $1.5 million (excluding options) and the second contract is expected to be awarded first quarter of FY04 for approximately $50 - $55 million.  This synopsis applies to the first phase contract for the Battle Station Program.  The concept design contract will provide events and scenarios designs for the Battle Stations Exercise that take advantage of the entertainment industry?s ability to create imaginative and convincing experiences.  Further objectives for phase one consist of development, refinement and formalization of the conceptual design criteria for the production equipment to include:  Operational Requirement Considerations; Logistics Elements; Building Design Interface Considerations; and Non-proprietary procurement specifications for all production equipment. The basic award of phase one will be a Firm Fixed Price type contract awarded using a trade-off basis with a follow-on post contract support services option, exercised if required.  NAWCTSD seeks to competitively award this contract on a 100% small business set-aside (See Note #1).  The Government anticipates that a pre-proposal conference/site visit at Great Lakes Recruit Training Center, IL will be held on or about 21 May 2002.  A draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) will be posted on the below website on or about 15 April 2002.  Offerors submitting proposals responsive to the terms and conditions of the solicitation will be required to give an oral presentation of their technical capabilities and management plan.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) has a requirement for engineering and technical services to satisfy modeling requirements in support of new and on-going warhead development projects.  The USMC requires explosives modeling to explain the results of live explosive testing and to give insight into the performance of proposed explosive formulations before the mixtures are fabricated, loaded in weapon form, and tested.  The modeling shall use a gas dynamics model to demonstrate the initial explosive blast and secondary combustion flows, and will be integrated with another government owned munitions effects model to assess the damage to structures.  To meet operational requirements, a sensitivity analysis shall be performed to prescribe the explosive formulation and quantity of explosive required.  MARCORSYSCOM intends to award a sole source contract to Centra Technology, Incorporated, 83 Cambridge Street, Suite 1A, Burlington, MA, 01803-4181.  Currently, Centra has developed the only existing Gas Dynamics Tool Model and is therefore, the only contractor qualified and capable to fulfill the Government's modeling requirement within the required delivery period.  The technical POCs for this requirement are: Maj Thad R. Trapp, SMAW/FOTS Project Officer, MARCORSYSCOM, (703) 784-2006, extension 2720, and Mr. Karl Solomon, Systems Engineer, Anti-Armor Division, MARCORSYSCOM, (703) 784-2006, extension 2726.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conducted its first national survey of the public's attitudes and behaviors regarding drinking and driving in 1991.  This survey provided data on several topic areas including: personal consumption, drinking and driving frequency, intervention measures, perceived threat of drinking and driving, perceived consequences of drinking and driving, and opinions on enforcement and penalties.  Since 1991, NHTSA has continued to track the nature and scope of the drinking driver problem by administering a national survey every two years.  The most recent biennial drinking and driving survey was administered in 2001.  The findings from this survey are scheduled to become available by the end of calendar 2002.  The objectives of this project are to: (1) Measure the current status of attitudes, knowledge, and behavior of the general driving public regarding drinking, and driving after drinking; and, (2) Identify the nature and extent of changes in these attitudes, knowledge, and behavior that have occurred over the course of six biennial drinking and driving surveys (1991 through 2001).
This requirement requires the administration of a national telephone survey to measure the attitudes and behaviors of the general driving age public, and to track the changes that have occurred over this and the five previous drinking and driving surveys.  The survey instrument to be used will be a revised version of that used in the 2001 survey.  Prior to administration of the survey, the contractor shall perform revisions to the questionnaire based on guidance provided by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).  The contractor shall also be responsible for analysis of the data and for preparation of the final reports that describes the background, methods and findings. A cost reimbursable type contract is anticipated with a period of performance of nineteen (19) months for the 2003 survey with two nineteen (19) month options.  Electronic copies of this solicitation will be available on the GSA's Electronic Posting System (EPS), located on the Internet at http://www.esp.gov.  Requests for paper copies must be in writing to the NHTSA address above.  The anticipated issuance date is May 30, 2002.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) at Orlando, FL, has identified a requirement to develop conceptual and preliminary designs for the Battle Stations Exercise.  The overall objective of the Battle Stations Program is to provide the Navy?s recruits with the culminating training exercise in the final phase of their training. This entire Battle Stations Exercise will be comprised of specified events (e.g., move aboard a ship) and scenarios (e.g., small boat attack) that push recruits to their physical, mental and emotional limits, requiring them to draw on every aspect of their basic training curriculum. The recruits must utilize the skills and knowledge they obtained during recruit training in an environment that approximates the stressors that can be encountered in the operational shipboard environment The Battle Station Program will be done in a two contract strategy, the first phase being for the creative concept and design of the events and scenarios being supported by NAWCTSD, and the second phase being for the construction and implementation of the Battle Station Exercise Facility being supported by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) at Great Lakes, IL.  The first contract is expected to be awarded in August 2002 with an estimated 10 month period of performance for approximately $1.5 million (excluding options) and the second contract is expected to be awarded first quarter of FY04 for approximately $50 - $55 million.  This synopsis applies to the first phase contract for the Battle Station Program.  The concept design contract will provide events and scenarios designs for the Battle Stations Exercise that take advantage of the entertainment industry?s ability to create imaginative and convincing experiences.  Further objectives for phase one consist of development, refinement and formalization of the conceptual design criteria for the production equipment to include:  Operational Requirement Considerations; Logistics Elements; Building Design Interface Considerations; and Non-proprietary procurement specifications for all production equipment. The basic award of phase one will be a Firm Fixed Price type contract awarded using a trade-off basis with a follow-on post contract support services option, exercised if required.  NAWCTSD seeks to competitively award this contract on a 100% small business set-aside (See Note #1).  The Government anticipates that a pre-proposal conference/site visit at Great Lakes Recruit Training Center, IL will be held on or about 21 May 2002.  A draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) will be posted on the below website on or about 15 April 2002.  Offerors submitting proposals responsive to the terms and conditions of the solicitation will be required to give an oral presentation of their technical capabilities and management plan.  Specific details will be provided in the formal Request for Proposal (RFP) N61339-02-R-0048 which will be posted on the World Wide Web at ?http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/Ebusiness/BusOps/Index.cfm? (click on Open Acquisitions) on or about 10 May 2002.  Be advised that periodic access to the website is essential for obtaining updated documentation and the latest information regarding the procurement. Questions and comments on the SOO and any other documents posted regarding subject requirement are welcome and should be emailed to Gonzalezra@navair.navy.mil and may be posted on the solicitation website.

<DESC>The Office for the Undersecretary of Defense (OUSD) for Science and Technology and the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) Sensors Directorate will be Co-hosting a Software Protection Initiative (SPI) Industry Day on Thursday, 24 Apr 02, at the Holiday Inn-International Drive Resort, 6515 International Drive, Orlando, FL, telephone number is (407) 351-3500. The purpose of the Industry Day is to familiarize industry and academia with Software Protection Initiative (SPI) and its technology objectives.  A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation will be released shortly after the Industry Day. Information contained in the BAA announcement takes precedence over any information obtained from the Industry Day or any other sources.  

The SPI requires research that is broad in scope and topical in nature to provide advances in knowledge and understanding, and to obtain new creative solutions that enhance the ability for software protection.

The Software Protection Initiative (SPI) is an OUSD for Science and Technology sponsored joint research initiative with the AFRL Sensors Directorate to identify and promote advanced research topics that address the technology needs/issues/limitations/barriers in current software protection technology.  The overall objective of the SPI is to identify, study, and evaluate the key technologies needed to strengthen current software protection capabilities for scientific, engineering, modeling, simulation, and operational software that executes on special-purpose and general-purpose computers.

The SPI topics include but are not limited to the following research areas: software protection science & engineering tools, software protection forensics, software protection research investigations/experiments; software protection security policies; software protection component security software contracts, computation accuracy security; computation precision security; computation precision and accuracy control and access; execution host management and traceability; distribution accountability; software protection and distribution sensors; distribution and copy traceability; binary inspection protection; secure notification of use or reuse; software distribution management and accountability; development of software protection science; development of science-based metrics & methods for software protection; and multi-level protection.  Additional topics include component-level software protection; component-based software protection; module-based software protection; module-level software protection; distributed software system protection; inherent access control & management; autonomous protection; autonomous, unsupervised protection assessment; protection of scientific and engineering applications; protection of modeling and simulation applications; design, development, and evaluation of software protection technologies; distribution traceability; protection of operational software on general purpose computers; and multiyear software protection and distribution defense.  Further topics are computational accuracy and precision control; automatic and inherent misuse notification; software protection conceptual design and documentation; technology transition; reference prototype implementations; composable, scalable, and separable protection technologies; protection technology visualization; defensive system biological model paradigms; software architecture to enhance software protection; and technology tools & theory.  Other topics include virtual machine approaches to achieving software protection at the component, framework, aspect, and object levels; protection metrics development and evaluation; component trust and security assurance; technologies for self-destruct or accuracy degradation upon misuse detection; and software protection technologies for mobile code.  The government anticipates that there will be a hardware component to some of the technologies proposed for software protection.  Therefore, hardware solutions are encouraged and the research related to the list of topics provided above or other topics related to the SPI may have both hardware and a software aspect.

Network security, intrusion prevention, and intrusion detection are outside the scope of announcement and anticipated procurements.

The Industry Day will provide background information concerning the initiative, discuss program management and budget, and discuss the topics of interest to the program.

Questions related to SPI technology objectives and the SPI program will be taken throughout the presentation at Industry Day in Orlando, FL.

All contracting-related questions should be referred to the Contractual POCs at the phone numbers or e-mail addresses given below.

A group e-mail list for the distribution of information related to the SPI has also been established, parties interested in enrolling in the SPI e-mail list should go to https://lyris.vdl.afrl.af.mil/cgi-bin/lyris.pl?site=spi .

Sign-in will begin at 0900 hours and the government briefing will begin at 1000 hours and conclude at 1400.  The briefings will be UNCLASSIFIED.  No advance questions will be taken.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) at Orlando, FL, has identified a requirement to develop conceptual and preliminary designs for the Battle Stations Exercise.  The overall objective of the Battle Stations Program is to provide the Navy?s recruits with the culminating training exercise in the final phase of their training. This entire Battle Stations Exercise will be comprised of specified events (e.g., move aboard a ship) and scenarios (e.g., small boat attack) that push recruits to their physical, mental and emotional limits, requiring them to draw on every aspect of their basic training curriculum. The recruits must utilize the skills and knowledge they obtained during recruit training in an environment that approximates the stressors that can be encountered in the operational shipboard environment The Battle Station Program will be done in a two contract strategy, the first phase being for the creative concept and design of the events and scenarios being supported by NAWCTSD, and the second phase being for the construction and implementation of the Battle Station Exercise Facility being supported by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) at Great Lakes, IL.  The first contract is expected to be awarded in August 2002 with an estimated 10 month period of performance for approximately $1.5 million (excluding options) and the second contract is expected to be awarded first quarter of FY04 for approximately $50 - $55 million.  This synopsis applies to the first phase contract for the Battle Station Program.  The concept design contract will provide events and scenarios designs for the Battle Stations Exercise that take advantage of the entertainment industry?s ability to create imaginative and convincing experiences.  Further objectives for phase one consist of development, refinement and formalization of the conceptual design criteria for the production equipment to include:  Operational Requirement Considerations; Logistics Elements; Building Design Interface Considerations; and Non-proprietary procurement specifications for all production equipment. The basic award of phase one will be a Firm Fixed Price type contract awarded using a trade-off basis with a follow-on post contract support services option, exercised if required.  NAWCTSD seeks to competitively award this contract on a 100% small business set-aside (See Note #1).  The Government anticipates that a pre-proposal conference/site visit at Great Lakes Recruit Training Center, IL will be held on or about 21 May 2002.  A draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) will be posted on the below website on or about 15 April 2002.  Offerors submitting proposals responsive to the terms and conditions of the solicitation will be required to give an oral presentation of their technical capabilities and management plan.

<DESC>TRAFFIC ALERT AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM (TCAS) AND TERRAIN AWARENESS AND WARNING SYSTEM (TAWS).=20 Response Date: 17 Apr 02.=20 Contract Award Date: 1Qtr FY03.=20 Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT - This is an Industry Day Announcement for the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) Follow-On Requirements. ESC/GAT would like to discuss its acquisition approach and its evaluation factors when determining contract award.  These discussions are intended for the prospective prime contractors (and their team members) for the planned TCAS and TAWS procurements. Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) Background.  The Global Air Traffic Operations/Mobility Command and Control (GATO/MC2) System Program Office (SPO) mission is to support the acquisition of Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) avionics for the Air Force fleet to allow unrestricted access of military aircraft to worldwide airspace, and to comply with Secretary of Defense-mandated Navigation Safety requirements.  Therefore, the SPO supports procurement of commercial equipment that conforms to appropriate military, civil and industry standards to meet current and future airspace requirements, or equipment that has a defined path to meet those objectives before deliveries of the equipment are scheduled to commence.  ESC/GAT centrally procures GATM equipment, maximizing avionics commonality across platforms. The individual aircraft platform SPOs integrates the equipment to their aircraft although they must inform ESC/GAT of all interoperability issues that might affect the = equipment=92s certification status. The following information is provided for planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as to its acquisition approach. The GATO/MC2 SPO at Hanscom AFB, MA is requesting information from industry concerning its plan to respond to the GATO/MC2 SPO acquisition approach for the TCAS and TAWS Follow-On requirements.  The SPO is planning on awarding the Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts during 1st Quarter of FY 03. The GATO/MC2 SPO will use the information gained from these discussions to gain an understanding of technical approaches to meet existing and future TCAS and TAWS requirements and to develop realistic acquisition strategies that promote commercial solutions.

<DESC>The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with Applied Biosystems in Foster City, CA to furnish, deliver (F.O.B. Destination) on or before August 1, 2002 and install one (1) Applied 4700 MALDI TOF-TOF  Mass Spectrometer System to the USDA, ARS, Plant, Soil and Nutrition Research Unit, Ithaca, New York.  This system will be used in a wide variety research projects where detailed knowledge of plant and microbial proteomes is critical.  The development of methods and instrumentation for automated high resolution mass spectrometry of peptides, advances in high-throughput protein separation technologies, and robust algorithms for data analysis is critical in achieving increased speed and sensitivity for identification and quantitation of components of complex biological samples.

The 4700 MALDI TOF-TOF Mass Spectrometer System includes the following salient characteristics: MALDI laser with pulse repetition rate of 100 Hz or better with maximum pulse duration of 1 femtosecond; high potential sample stage (+/- 25 kV) with delayed extraction and low mass filtering; operational in linear, reflector and true precursor selected MS-MS modes; in reflector mode, have mass accuracy of 10 parts per million (ppm) or better with internal calibration, or 50 ppm with external calibration with a resolution greater than 12000 at a signal to noise ratio of 200:1; have sensitivity in reflector mode such that 5 femtomoles of a peptide of mass 1750 amu will give a signal to noise ratio of 50:1; capable of acquiring full scan mass spectra within the mass range from 5-12000 atomic mass units or higher; perform tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) experiments on any selected precursor ion using high energy collisional activation with an inert target gas; have a mass accuracy of 50 ppm in MS-MS mode; perform precursor selection with suppression of ions with a +/- 3 amu window around a 1000 amu specified mass with less than 50% reduction in precursor ion signal; capable of fragmenting the selected precursor ion with a collision energy that can be varied between 0.5 and 2.5 keV;  mass resolution of fragment ions in the MS-MS mode must be no less than 5000 for fragment ions of mass 1500 amu; mass accuracy in MS-MS mode of +/- 50 ppm for fragments in the range of 400 - 1200 amu; sensitivity such that 5 femtomoles of a peptide will produce a signal to noise ratio greater than 10:1 for a 1000 amu fragment.  The system must be capable of acquiring and processing at least one MS and MS-MS spectrum per second and complete the acquisition of data from 20 samples per minute including time for automated searching of MALDI target spots for maximum signal strength; and, complete the acquisition of 1000 MS spectra or 500 MS-MS spectra per hour.  The detector and digitizer should have a 500 MHz bandwidth and 2GHz sampling rate.  Sample plates must accommodate a minimum of 96 samples and support bar codes.  Robotics and other facilities for handling sample plates must be provided to load and process at least 2000 samples under vacuum with operator intervention.  The sample stage should be controlled by the data acquisition system in automatic mode, or by joystick, mouse or comparable user input device in manual mode The system must include a 100 x magnification camera for visual inspection of the sample spot on the console of the data acquisition system.  Operating software must be a fully integrated suite that allows desktop control of all relevant instrumental operating parameters.  Software used for data dependent scanning must be capable of 1) obtaining a full scan spectrum, 2) determine charge state of ions in the spectrum, 3) automatically select ions of specific charge states, 4) determine whether ion abundances exceed present thresholds and 5) perform tandem mass spectrometry experiments on a specified number of ions that meet the aforementioned criteria.  The data system must be capable of performing these experiments in sequence, repetitively, during the course of data acquisition runs.

Companies interested in offering on the listed NSN, an item other
than Rolls-Royce Gear Systems item, please contact Esther Hayden
at 614-692-4727.  No RFP will be issued as it is the intention of
the Government to add these NSNs to an existing contract.  Evaluation will be on an NSN by NSN basis.  All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.  See Note(s): 12 and 26.  Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.  The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total duration(base plus option years) shall not exceed 4 years.  This proposed procurement includes a family group of items within the Federal Supply Class: 3010,3020,3040 and 5950.  This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Approved sources are listed on the aforementioned web site.
While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.

<DESC>UT-Battelle LLC (UT-Battelle), the management and operating contractor for the United States Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking expressions of interest from companies interested in licensing and commercializing ORNL's intellectual property in the technology area of aerosol beam-focus laser-induced plasma spectrometry.

ORNL has developed a field-portable prototype instrument for continuous in situ measurement of trace elements associated with airborne particulate matter or aerosols (U.S. Patent Number 6,359,687).  This instrument involves the coupling of an aerosol technology, aerosol beam focusing, to a laser-induced plasma spectrometer to enable the development of a high-precision miniaturized system capable of detecting the elemental composition of aerosols at levels several folds lower than previously accomplished by researchers and academia around the world.                     

The technology transfer process will be facilitated through appropriate licensing of UT-Battelle's intellectual property and associated research and development undertaken cooperatively between UT-Battelle and the licensee and funded by the licensee.  Research and development will focus on transitioning the technology from the current laboratory demonstration stage to commercialization.  Interested companies with experience and expertise commensurate with the requirements of this commercialization effort are invited to respond to this announcement.  Companies interested in this opportunity may obtain more detailed technical information and a description of the licensing and cooperative research and development process by submitting a statement of interest, including a written description of their company and its activities and an explanation of their potential application of the technology.  Expression of interest should be received by May 10, 2002. No licensing intermediaries please.  This is not a procurement activity.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center, Armament Product Directorate, Aerial Targets System Program Office (AAC/WMRA), Eglin AFB, Florida intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price contract action for approximately 15 AN/DPQ-9 Vector Doppler Scorer (VDOPS) systems to equip BQM-34-47 aerial targets in the Air Force inventory to Cartwright Electronics, 655 West Valencia Drive, Fullerton, CA 92832-2104.  These systems must be compatible with the existing VDOPS system operational infrastructure in place at Tyndall AFB, FL and Holloman AFB, NM.  The approximate value for this contract action is $650,000.  This action is for hardware production; no development or operational support is included.  The period of performance is planned to be approximately 9 months.  The AN/DPQ-9 VDOPS systems currently installed are operated and sustained by Cartwright Electronics (CE) through a separate contract.  The AN/DPQ-9 VDOPS is a CE proprietary system and was originally contracted as a competitive procurement awarded in February 1995.  The government does not own a technical data package for reprocurement.  The basic requirement of the VDOPS system is to provide the capability to reconstruct the time-tagged history of a missile trajectory.  The trajectory description must include the vector position of the missile relative to the aerial target with data collection whenever the missile is within 100 feet of the target.  The technical requirements in general include the following: range compatible (telemetry and sensor frequency, etc) with Tyndall AFB, Eglin AFB, and White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) range complexes, RF scoring technology, 100 percent spherical coverage, position accuracy within 2.0 feet or 8 percent of range to 100 feet (whichever is greater), 600 to 6500 feet per second relative velocity (target to missile) velocity accuracy within <1% of missile velocity, missile attitude accuracy of 5 degrees at 0 to 50 feet range and 10 degrees from 50 to 100 feet range, 2 targets in formation (200 feet minimum separation), quick look report of scalar point of closest approach and vector score within 2 hours proceeding time, and target integration on the BQM-34-47.  Responding firms must have a secret level security clearance and must be export control certified in accordance with DOD 5230.25.  Export Control certification may be obtained through the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Battle Creek, MI, 49016-3412, and telephone 1-800-352-3572.  Responsible sources that feel they meet the above requirements are invited to submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) no later than 15 days of this announcement to AAC/WMRA, ATTN: Capt. Michael Washington, 102 West D Avenue, Suite 300, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6808.  SOC should include and briefly describe plant, professional, and manufacturing resources, knowledge of the technologies involved, experience with noncooperative vector scoring systems and description of the firm's candidate system at the functional level and what aerial targets the system has been integrated and tested on.  Information sought includes size, weight, and power requirements, test data showing compliance with the technical requirements stated above, external interfaces (including connector specifications), scoring antenna requirements (quantity, transmit and receive), delivery and lead time for components (from order), environmental testing completed (vibration and high temperature), electromagnetic compatibility testing completed (susceptibility and areas of concern), operational "pre-flight" checkout requirements, and recommended government furnished equipment.  This is not a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Any hardware or services that the government may elect to procure as a result of responses to this inquiry will be announced separately.    An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties may contact Dr. Mario Caluda, at (850) 882-5558 or e-mail: mario.caluda@eglin.af.mil with concerns.  Program Management and technical questions may be addressed to 2Lt Joe Pugliese, Program Manager (850) 882-9307 Ext 5184, and for contracting questions Capt. Michael Washington, (850) 882-9307 Ext 5179.  Collect calls will not be accepted. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NA This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are b eing requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is DAJA22-02-T-0141 and is issued as a Request for Quotation.  The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circul ar (FAC) 06.  This solicitation is Unrestricted and the NAICS code is 541511.  The Government intends to award a contract for the following:  SuprTek Portable Freedom Secure Wireless Local Area Network (LAN) system, which includes hardware, software, ins tallation, and training.  The following items   CLIN 0001:  Fortress Technologies Inc. Air Fortress 1100, 5 each; CLIN 0002:  Fortress Technologies Inc. Air Fortress Remote Clients, 140 each; CLIN 0003:  Software Maintenance Updates, 140 each; CLIN 0004:  Installation and Training, 1 job; CLIN 0005: Lucent Technologies Avaya AP2000 Access points (5 each) with 2 Avaya World Cards each, includes bridging license and pigtails for radio cards; CLIN 0006:  Flat Panel Directional Antennas & 120 Degree Sector Pa nel, 5 each; CLIN 0007:  Optional Weather Resistant Mounting Case, 5 each; CLIN 0008:  Miscellaneous Cable LRM 400 (Brackets, etc), 1 lot; CLIN 0009:  Optional BackUps 300, 5 each; CLIN 0010:  Avaya Gold World Wireless Network Interface Cards, 140 each; CL IN 0011:  Optional Add-on Client Antennas, 140 each.  SYSTEM OVERVIEW:  The system is a weather resistant portable solution named Freedom designed for rapid setup and minimal configuration.  The system is based on current 802.11b standard, with component s allowing for upgrade to 802.11G (an enhanced standard which allows for increased bandwidth).  The system shall include the physical portable (radio and antenna) solution and a bundled software and wireless adapter for the clients to be serviced by this s ystem.  It shall be secured on both the Server and Client using a FIPS 140-1 3DES encryption algorithm per NIST and NSA standards.  COMPONENT DESCRIPTIONS:  Two Wireless Radio Cards shall be provided per system.  This allows for either redundancy if one F reedom system is used to aggregate the signal or allows for one radio to act as an access point and the other to be used to bridge to another freedom system.   Bridging is the function of using the Layer 2 Ethernet MAC address to move data packets f rom one unit to the other.  This redundant use of Freedom systems allows for roaming clients to attach to the system that provide the most signal.  The access point function is the standard 802.11b device of associating with client wireless cards and a cting as a gateway to the wired network connected to the LAN or communications package on the other side of the radio.  The system shall be FIPS certified and include a Secure Packet Shield technology that allows for client roaming with automatic client registration.  This also provides the client with the ability to roam between access points and even pas through a dead zone with no signal but be able to reconnect to the wireless network without manual re-authentication.  This technology shall work at Layer 2 of the OSI model that masks the IP information in the packets, insuring an additional level of security outside the 3 DES algorithm.  The Air Fortress shall be loaded on each individual Client that is to have access to the portable wireless network .  POWER MANAGEMENT:  Each unit shall have a Liebert uninterruptible Power Supply, which shall provide line protection and also battery back up for short interval power outages.  UPS units can be in 110V or 220V power varieties.  ANTENNAS:  The system shal l be provided with one 120 Degree Antenna for broad signal aggregation and one panel directional antenna for point to point Line of Site connections for bridg ing of multiple Freedom systems.  PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION:  The system shall have weather-covered and sealed outlets for the antenna, power and RJ45 connections.  The system will be used in the field - total system weight shall be more than 65 lbs and shall  be capable of fitting into an optional foam injected customized case for shipping.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division intends to procure on an other than full and open competition research and samples of BAMO/NMMO.  The requirement is sole sourced to Flourochem Inc., 680 Sayon Ave. Azusa CA 91702, for their unique capabilities to produce small (25 g each) experimental batches of BAMO/NMMO.  Award shall be made in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  Contract Lime Item Number (CLIN) 0001 is for BAMO/NMMO.  A new cure reaction has been under development, which uses the azido-functions on the BAMO/NMMO for the cure.  Mechanical properties of the new cured binders need improvement and it is thought that varying the BAMO percentages to lower level than 70% and varying the locations of the BAMO groups on the polymer will result in improved mechanical properties.  The contractor will synthesize small samples of BAMO/NMMO of varying BAMO content in order to perform evaluations.  The contractor will provide a 6 month research program with the principal objective being to show feasibility of approached and samples of the products will be submitted to NAWS in approximately 25 g each.  Any firms believing that they can provide the services required may submit a written response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 5 days after the date of publication of this notice, clearly showing it's ability to do so without compromising the quality, accuracy and reliability of the data or without causing programmatic hardship to the program.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The National Cancer Institute intends to negotiate a modification for additional effort and funds to an existing contract (N02-CM-87020) with Theradex.  This contract provides the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and other selected investigators participating in the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) sponsored clinical trials with a Clinical Trials Monitoring Services (CTMS).  The contract includes 5 tasks: 1) to provide a central data management resource for DCTD sponsored investigational agent Phase 1 and selected Phase 2 clinical trials, 2) to provide an on-site auditing resource for the DCTD to assure compliance with Federal regulations and to verify submitted data and assure protocol compliance, 3)  to provide oversight of quality assurance programs of groups and consortiums through co-site audits, 4) to assure that cancer centers or single institutions conducting DCTD sponsored clinical trials are in compliance with Federal regulations, and 5)  to assure that international groups/institutions are in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and International Conference on Harmonization standards.  The increased use of labor hours for data collection; database maintenance and reporting is running ahead of the planned cumulative level of effort.  Some of the factors that have affected the increased level of effort are: an increased proportion of multi-site phase 1 protocols have been assigned to CTMS; there is a greater need for increased scrutiny of patient safety data; there are more frequent ad hoc reporting requests; there are increased programming needs to coordinate CTMS reporting with the CTEP Clinical data Update Summary (CDUS); there are continuing data submission and compliance issues at the NCI Center for Cancer Research; and there are  increased programming needs to assure the  CTMS database is compatible with the CTEP Enterprise system.   The level of effort shall be increased by 38,656 hrs for the period 6/1/02 -4/30/03, to provide for additional support services as outlined above.  Authority: 41 U.S.C 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The RFP for re-competition of this contract will be released in the June-July time frame.  See numbered Note 22 which applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>DESC: The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Prevention, (DCP) Chemoprevention Agent Development Research Group (CADRG) is interested in conducting animal cancer model studies of biomarkers and intermediate endpoints that might be used in human clinical trials in  order to examine in detail the biomarker modulating effects of selected chemopreventive compounds. In addition the studies will improve biomarker sensitivity, specificity, assay methodology, and sample handling. The emphasis will be on efficient studies aimed at providing more quantitative, and more validated intermediate endpoints for future human clinical trials.  Intermediate endpoints or biomarkers that are directly associated with the evolution of neoplasia, and that develop with much higher frequency in abnormal cells of susceptible individuals than do the actual tumors, will make it possible in the future to carry out many studies on fewer subjects for shorter durations.  If such biomarkers were found to be modified by a particular intervention regimen in preclinical studies, a rationale would be provided for carrying out clinical studies. The application of biological markers to clinical cancer prevention trials carries great promise in relation to ultimate cancer prevention.  When neoplasia itself is used as an end point in studies of this type, a very large number of subjects tested for long durations are often required.  The results of these in vivo experiments will be used to select promising intermediate endpoints for Phase II human studies whose objectives are to study the modulation of a selected biomarker in response to a chemopreventive agent. These relevant preclinical studies will be used to help achieve one of the major goals of the chemoprevention program which is the timely evaluation of chemopreventive agents in clinical trials. A number of chemical compounds and/or dietary components have been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in animal models, in vitro systems, and to be associated with cancer reduction in epidemiological studies. Results from animal studies suggest that a number of compounds and/or dietary components may affect several stages of carcinogenesis. A variety of excellent biomarkers are now available. Examples include reversal of abnormal cytology, ornithine decarboxylase activity, prostaglandin synthetase inhibition, DNA ploidy alterations, changes in cellular proliferation (e.g., tritiated thymidine or BrdU labeling indices, decreases in PCNA or Ki-67 antigens, or histology), and oncogene suppression tests.  The development and utilization of sensitive and accurate intermediate endpoints should enhance the ability to design effective human Phase II clinical trials. This RFP will involve nine (9) workstatements (Nos. 62-70).  Certain study design characteristics apply to the specific Workstatements under this RFP. Most of the requirements for the Workstatement study design will be detailed in the specific workstatement. Each workstatement will have a specific period of performance. The workstatements are: Workstatement #62- Evaluation of Chemopreventive Agents by Whole Body Real Time Imaging Using Orthotopic Transplantation of "Phenotypically Normal" Tumor-Derived Human Cells; Workstatement #63 - Effects of Chemopreventive Agents and "Folate-deficient Western Diet" on Colon Cancer in Compound Mutant Mice; Workstatement #64 - Effects of Chemopreventive Agents and Folate Deficient Diet on Mouse Models of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia:  Intermediate Endpoints of Disease Progression; Workstatement #65 - Intermediate Biomarker Discovery from Altered Gene Expression in Animal Tumors:  Modulation Of Gene Expression By Known Chemopreventive Agents; Workstatement #66 - Comparative Genomic Hybridization Analysis of Multiple Mouse Animals Models of Cancer and Determination of the Effects of Chemopreventive Agents; Workstatement #67 - Induction of Genes by Retinoids and Soy-Related Products:  Effects of Various Agents, Dose-Response Relationships, and Expression of Genes in Multiple Tissues; Workstatement #68 - Examination of Potential Biomarkers of Chemopreventive Effects in Colon Lesions And Normal Mucosa and in Lung Lesions And Normal Parenchyma; Workstatement #69 - Examination Of Biomarker Modulation Following Treatment With Potential Chemopreventive Agents In A UV  Induced Model Of Skin Tumorigenesis; Workstatement #70 - RNA Expression Profiles of COX-2 Inhibitors in the Colon of 
Mock-Treated and Carcinogen-Treated Mice.

Specific interest is in wideband arrays, multi-octave Low Noise Amplifier's (LNA), wideband circulators/switches, and associated multibeam beamformer.  Large dynamic range and linearity are key parameters for all devices.  Program objectives are to enhance the performance of, and enable entirely new capabilities / architectures for, tactical and strategic Radio Frequency (RF) systems by expanding the instantaneous bandwidth available in system front ends. Significant reductions in hardware are also expected as the entire amplifier/beamforming chain will accommodate the full aperture bandwidth. The program goal is to demonstrate multi-beam, multi-octave operation of a small array antenna(s).  DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas: 1.) Wideband Aperture: Structures for the implementation of multi-octave array antennas.  2.) LNA / Circulators:  For multi-octave operation.3.) Beamformer: Beamforming approaches must able to steer at least 10 (with a goal of over 100) beams from multi-octave feeds. 4.) E/M Simulation Environment: Improvements in the efficiency of electromagnetic design tools is required.  5.) User Requirements / Insertion Study: Identification of potential users / early adopters of the wideband array technology.   Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 02-17 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.  PROGRAM SCOPE: Awards totaling approximately $50 million over four years are expected to be made during the second half of calendar year 2002.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are strongly encouraged.  A website --https://www.davincinetbook.com/uwbaa  --has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Bill Schneider, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: wschneider@darpa.mil. GENERAL INFORMATION: Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled "BAA 02-17, Ultra Wideband Array Antennas, Proposer Information Pamphlet" which provides further information on areas of interest, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original and eight (8) copies of the proposal to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 02-17) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Monday, June 3, 2002, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 02-17 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only".  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Ultra Wideband Array Antennas. All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 02-17.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to DARPA mission, (3) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition, (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort. The administrative addresses for this BAA are:  Fax:  (703) 351-8616 (Addressed to: DARPA/MTO, BAA 02-17), Electronic Mail:  BAA02-17@darpa.mil Mail: DARPA/MTO, ATTN: BAA 02-17 3701 North Fairfax Drive Arlington, VA 22203-1714.

The CIRC is a key element to be used by VA to assure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of information and services for Veterans.  The CIRC operates to ensure that computer security incidents are detected, reported, and corrected as quickly as possible and with minimal impact on the availability and integrity of Veteran services.  In addition, the CIRC helps VAs Chief Information Officer (CIO) provide assurance that cyber security controls are in place to protect automated information systems from financial fraud, waste, and abuse.  The CIRC will assist in preventing future incidents from occurring by providing the Office of Cyber Security with materials for use in awareness activities and distribution throughout VA.  The CIRC will also help VA contain computer incidents by providing the necessary countermeasures and response mechanisms to deal with cyber security incidents.  This procurement is 100% small business set aside, subject to NAICS: 541512, 541513 and 541519 all having a size standard of 21 Million average gross annual revenue.  Joint ventures or teaming arrangements may be implemented and are strongly encouraged for this contract since the complexity of this service requires the expertise of several aspects of a cyber security program.  A joint venture may consist of two or more small businesses that perform 51% of the work under the contract.  Large businesses may team with a small business teaming arrangement, but may not perform more than 49% of the work under the contract.  The contract will provide for a base year and nine (9) option years.  The objective of this Procurement is to choose a single best value proposal that provides trade-offs that are advantageous to the Government.  The following evaluation criteria shall be used to evaluate offers, Management Plan including key personnel and/or teaming arrangement, Past Performance, and Cost.  Management plan is the most significant criteria of all.  Past performance is next and pricing is the least most significant factor.

The Web address is http://www.bos.oamm.va.gov/cgi-bin/webobjects/bospublic.woa.  All interested parties are required to register with this web page to be included on the bidders mailing list.

<DESC>Furnish all labor, supplies, materials, tools, transportation, and supervision necessary to provide complete, self contained appraisal reports to the U.S. Forest Service for a period of one year from award date.  This will be an indefinite quantity, requirements type contract and prices and particulars wil be negotiated as assignments are needed.

Evaluation Factors for Award of Contract

(a)  Governmental Experience - Address experience in providing complete, self contained appraisal reports to federal government agencies.  Greatest consideration will be given to the number of appraisal reports approved for agency use by the USDA - Forest Service and/or appraisal reports completed in a format substantially similar to that outlined in Section 210 of Technical Specifications.
(b)  Quality Sample - Provide a quality sample of a narrative appraisal report of property similar to the subject properties anticipated to be appraised; i.e., timberland, rural homestead or residential property.  The report(s) will be relied upon for technical grading.  The sample report(s) will be given greatest consideration on completeness and quality of presentation, analysis of market data, and those where adequate market data support of adjustments between comparable sales and the subject is included (as opposed to those with adjustments based only on the appraisers judgement or experience).  Samples tendered will be treated as privileged information and will not be released to any third party(s) unless so ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.  After award of the contract this report will be destroyed or returned to the appraiser, if requested.
(c)  Appraisal Experience - Greatest consideration will be given to those appraisers that have extensive experience appraising rural properties.
(d)  Appraisal Expertise - Provide information on the education and experience of the appraiser(s) who will be performing the work.  Greatest consideration will be given to those appraisers that have substantial education and professional credentials applicable to appraising rural properties.
(e)  Expert Witness Capability - Describe experience of the appraiser(s) in providing expert witness testimony, and provide attorney reference who can comment on the ability of the appraiser(s) to present effective and creditable testimony in defense of their appraisal opinions if necessary.
(f)  Ability to Respond to Assignments in a Timely Manner - The default turnaround time on completing individual appraisal assignments is thirty days.  Longer times may be negotiated for more complex assignments.  Vendors who cannot normally respond to assignments in thirty days will be ranked lower than those vendors who can so commit.

<DESC>Slit lamp with superior optics with high light transmission and resolution through their converging focusing system. Another feature requested is a single joystick control for horizontal and vertical positioning for ease and comfort. The slit lamp must have a sliding fixation device which travels across the head rest rather than fixated at a single point. This permits the fixation light to be brought in front of either eye in a notch position. This can be automatically centered within a 90 degree cone, allowing uninterrupted observation through the slit lamp while simultaneously guiding the patient's eye to any desired position. The transformer automatically adjusts to any voltage source. The magnification system must used the drum style changer, provide magnification up to 40X. The convergent style binocular eliminates double images commonly perceived when working with parallel eyepieces.

<DESC>NA The US Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager - Force Sustainment Systems, Natick, MA, has a requirement for a cargo parachute that will enable cargo aerial delivery operations, using standard low velocity airdrop extraction techniques, from an altit ude of 500 feet Above Ground Level (AGL).  It is intended that this new cargo parachute will replace both the G-11 and G-12 cargo parachutes.  This new cargo parachute, used in either a single or clustered configuration, shall have the following performanc e characteristics: capable of delivering combat loads having rigged weights between 2,520 pounds through 22,000 pounds (objective) (15,500 pounds (threshold)); capable of deploying/recovering from military cargo aircraft traveling between 130-150 knots ind icated air speed (KIAS); deliver loads in ground wind speeds of 17 knots (threshold) (21 knots (objective)); maximum rate of descent at ground impact shall not exceed 28.5 ft/sec; provide a successful airdrop completion rate of 92 percent without a system abort; capable of being used in mass formation airdrops of supplies and equipment, singularly, and sequentially using current tactics for delivery of Strategic Brigade Airdrop (medium) loads; deliver loads in fully mission capable (FMC) condition with mini mal modification to standard airdrop rigging (threshold) and FMC condition with no change to the airdrop rigging (objective); capable of being packed and rigged in a time greater than the time required for current comparable LVAD loads with like capacities  (threshold) or a time equal to or less than that of current operations (objective); be fully compatible with existing airdrop components (i.e. Type V platform and associated airdrop hardware) (threshold) or with new or modified components (objective); cap able of operation and storage in the same climate categories (hot, basic, cold, and severe cold) as current LVAD operations; be supportable by the standard Army logistics system, and maintainable by MOS 92R rigger personnel at organizational level; must la nd the airdropped cargo within a low circular area of probability.  It is desired that this new cargo parachute be compatible for application to all platform and container low velocity cargo airdrop, including C-17 Dual Row Airdrop Capability (DRAC) and th e developmental Enhanced Container Delivery Capability (ECDC).  Emphasis on durable lightweight materials and low/simplified maintenance is highly desired.  Proposals that discuss existing systems, which demonstrate substantial compliance with 500' LVADC p erformance requirements, will be favorably considered than entirely new designs or engineering approaches. For informational purposes only and to obtain the latest information regarding the 500FT LVADC before the RFP release, please go to our web site at h ttps://www3.natick.army.mil/under Business Opportunities/UPCOMING ACQUISITIONS/DAAD16-02-R-0010.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the Soldier Systems Center web site located at https://www3.natick.army.mil/ under Business Opportunities/Ong oing Acquisitions/DAAD16-02-R-0010 ON OR ABOUT May 3, 2002. NO hardcopies will be mailed. Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Xinia Llovet-Zurinaga, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at Xinia.Llovet-Zurinaga@natick.army.mil or fax (508) 233-5286 or 4998. Firms will not be reimbursed for any cost associated with proposal preparation.  Proposal evaluation will include, but not be limited to, the following processes: A RFP will be issued and offerors' proposals will be evaluated to det ermine the item's ability to meet the above requirements.  A competitive range will be established and offerors of proposals that fall within the range will be issued purchase orders for prototype parachutes to be tested and evaluated.  A minimum of five p rototypes parachutes must be ready for testing 60 days after issuance of purchase order.  Offerors will be required to provide packing/rigging, repair and tra ining support during these tests, and will be compensated for such support as a separate Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) in the purchase order. These prototypes will be tested and evaluated against performance requirements and will compete against a gover nment developed cargo parachute referred to as the SB-60.  A down-select to one or more cargo parachutes will be conducted and will be based on the offeror's proposal and results of the initial test and evaluation of the prototype parachutes.  A contract w ill then be awarded to the successful offerors to include an option for Demonstration/Validation (D/V) and an option for Developmental/Operational Testing (DT/OT).  D/V will include CLINs for parachutes, engineering, and testing support.  The D/V option wi ll be part of the base effort requiring 2-10 parachutes from each vendor and will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type contract.  Test items will undergo evaluation for fit, form and function, and will also be subjected to airdrop testing.  After testing and eval uation, a down-select will be conducted by an Integrated Product Team (IPT) to exercise an option to a single offeror to deliver 5 (minimum) to 75 (maximum) production ready parachutes.  These items will be subjected to DT/OT to determine if they satisfy a ll performance requirements identified in the ORD.  This option will include CLINs for parachutes, engineering, and testing support.  Also included in this option will be the requirement for the delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) (to include comple te drawings and detailed specifications).  Upon completion of DT/OT testing, a production option - Firm Fixed Price may be issued to meet the Army's initial estimated fielding requirements of approximately 1,165 cargo parachutes.  Follow on production cont racts may be awarded, based on the TDP, to acquire the remainder of the Army's estimated fielding requirements of approximately 10,481 cargo parachutes.  This acquisition will be conducted on a Full and Open Competitive basis.

<DESC>Additional information:  To assist in the study of options and selection of a preferred approach and preparation of the required deliverables, the Air Armament Center SEEK EAGLE Office (AAC/SK) will be prepared to provide aircraft fit modeling to offerors if they are interested.  Results would be available back to offerors approximately 30 days after contractor computer models, in a format specified by AAC/SK, are provided to the Government.  AAC/SK will protect the competitive nature of any contractor computer models submitted for assessment.  A favorable fit check is not required to complete the Air Launched Vehicle Integration (ALVIN) but risks associated with this issue will be addressed during the upcoming System Development and Demonstration source selection.  Offerors may choose not to use the AAC/SK service.  In that case, the AF will provide carriage configurations and the contractor will be responsible for generating loadouts.  All other information publicized in the original synopsis is correct *****

Selection criteria will be in accord with FAR Section 36.602-1, Selection Criteria. If a firm has multiple offices, for each of the criteria requiring demonstrated ability and experience, show project experience for each specific office and list the personnel in that office who would be assigned to perform the work. Selection will be based on the professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance as demonstrated by the following criteria and evaluation points. The evaluation factors and evaluation points for selection are: (1) Specialized experience of in-house staff in hydrology and hydraulics. Note that subcontracting of hydrology or hydraulics is not allowed. (25 points);(2) Demonstrated experience of key personnel in working with the firm under consideration, in performing studies for water supply and drainage design, in hydraulic modeling of flood control works, reservoir planning, open channel hydraulics, in performing hydrologic studies and in flood risk assessment and floodplain mapping for riverine environs.

Firms on the short lists will receive a facsimile notice of their selection and will be given written questions to be answered orally over the telephone (conference call) within 24 hours of notification or thereabout. Upon receipt of the "short-list" responses a final evaluation and selection of the most qualified firms for each proposed procurement will be made for EMN-2002-I-RII-LRG, proposals will be requested from up two of the highest ranked firms (or from four if no small businesses are found to be qualified under EMN-2002-I-RII-SBS) and cost negotiations will be conducted with each firm. If a mutually satisfactory contract can not be negotiated with any of those firms, negotiations will be terminated with those firms and the process will proceed to the next firm(s) until award is made for the desired number of contracts or all the "short listed" firms have been rejected. Responses shall reference either "Synopsis Number: EMN-2002-I-RII-LRG "ID/IQ Flood Studies for FEMA Region II" and EMF-2002-I-RII-SBS "ID/IQ Flood Studies for FEMA Region II" on the face of both the SF 254 and SF 255 for each procurement as well as the outside of the envelope.

<DESC>This purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions, to further define the requirement, to change the date for receipt of proposals, to allow offerors to submit their proposal electronically, to eliminate the need to submit the representations and certifications in FAR 52.212-3 and to require submission of additional information with your proposal.

Question 1. In the body of the text of the solicitation, it is requested that the display, once collapsed and in its case, be able to fit into an overhead
bin on an airplane. Is this critical? Most of these types of displays/back
drops , with new security at Airports, will no longer be able to travel as
carry on luggage and for the most part they will be too large to fit in the
overhead bin. Please let me know if this portion of the requirement can be
eliminated.

Answer: Based on post 9/11 restrictions the requirement that the backdrop, when collapsed, fit in an overhead bin is eliminated.  However, compactness will be a part of the selection criteria.  

Question 2. The logo on the units. Would you like this to be a removable graphic that Velcro's to the panel or would you like the graphic to be
silk-screened to the fabric and be a permanent part of the display panels?

Answer:  The graphic should be silk-screened.  Velcro is unacceptable.

Question 3. Under "General Information": The Due date for the proposal is April 15 however in the body of the text, third line from the end, it states that the bids were due on April 2 @ 1:00PM. My hope is that the April 15th date is the correct date.

Answer:  The correct date and time is April 15 at 3:00PM

Question 4.  Will you accept proposals electronically?

Answer:  Yes.  They may be sent to dennisd@ntsb.gov

You are requested to submit the following information with your offer: Company name, address, telephone and fax number, Business size. Tax Payer Identification Number (TIN), DUNS number, Location, Warranty information, and place of contract performance.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis-- The U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting a market survey to seek information and to determine the interest from private industry in providing Acquisition Support Services and Acquisition related Information Technology support. 
The federal acquisition community (including both the information technology/CIO community and the procurement community) has been subject to significant reform initiatives over the past several years. These reform measures such as the Clinger-Cohen Act, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), as well as the more recent Presidential and OMB directives to increase the use of performance-based contracting techniques have significantly changed the federal government?s approach to acquiring goods and services. Many federal agencies are having difficulties fully understanding and implementing these reform measures and streamlining practices and procedures. There is a shortage of experience and expertise in effectively implementing acquisition reform measures.
DOC/OAM seeks statements of qualifications from firms who provide a broad suite of acquisition support services, Information Technology, Business Development, and Performance Based Contracting, with an emphasis on innovative and aggressive steps to plan, control, and manage acquisition functions that are not inherently governmental in an efficient and cost-effective manner.  This not only includes innovative ways to manage existing contracts, but also innovative ways to acquire new or additional resources. 
A Statement of Opportunities (SOO) will be made available via FedBizOpps within the next two weeks to contractors interested in this project.  The SOO will provide data which vendors can use to understand the organization's functions in terms of purpose, scope and volume.  Vendors will be asked to submit solutions  which offer the greatest potential benefit to DOC/OAM, by outsourcing to a commercial entity.  If it is determined that there is no productivity or economic benefit to U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Acquisition Management resulting from the outsourcing of this activity, this acquisition may be cancelled, with the functions being retained in-house and performed by Federal employees.  No payments will be made to contractors for expenses incurred in this survey and submittal process.   
THERE IS NO SOLICIATATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for any information solicited. Close date will be determined with the issuance of the Statement of Objectives.

The Open Meeting for Vendors has been scheduled for Monday, April 15th at the Department of Commerce Building, 1401 Constitution Avenue, Washington DC 20230 from 1:30 to 3:30 in room 1414.  DOC is near Federal Triangle Metro Stop.   Please RSVP if you plan to attend. You will need to pass through security screening in the front lobby.  Send responses to Sharron White at swhite@doc.gov.

Questions and suggestions may be forwarded by email to swhite @doc.gov or fkrempa@doc.gov.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for forming mandrels to be used by NASA/GSFC to fabricate mirror segments for the X-ray telescope mirror assembly/spectroscopic telescope for the Constellation-X Mission.  Constellation-X has been identified as one of the top priority missions in NASA's Structure and Evolution of the Universe Roadmap.  This mission has been receiving solid support from NASA because it seeks to address some of the top-priority near-term science objectives in the investigation of the universe, and because the project has made rapid progress in developing technologies to achieve those science objectives.  The launch date for Constellation-X is planned for 2010.  Additional information, preliminary mandrel specifications, and response instructions are contained in the MS-Word file posted with this announcement.        No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.

Procurement related questions should be directed to: James King (james.s.king.1@gsfc.nasa.gov, telephone 301-286-6993). Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in Internet "Note A".  [INTERNET ONLY (commercial product definition)] This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered  in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.   All responses shall be submitted to James King no later than May 9, 2002.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic, Norfolk, VA is seeking interested sources to provide a wide range of technical and facility support services necessary to maintain the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS).  The planned NDGPS network will provide precision navigation coverage throughout the continental United States and Alaska and will consist of approximately 81 geographically dispersed sites.  Eight NDGPS sites are currently operational with the remainder planned for construction / conversion by 2004.   The Coast Guard also plans future integration of the existing network of Maritime Differential Global Positioning (MDGPS) sites into the _Nationwide_ system for a total of approximately 135 sites.  Services required to maintain the NDGPS network at a 99.7 percent operational availability will include a 7x24x365 call center for casualty reporting and response, preventative and corrective electronic maintenance for medium frequency radio transmitters, GPS reference receivers, integrity monitors, antennas, couplers, and towers.  Services to maintain auxiliary support systems at NDGPS sites are also anticipated.  These include maintenance and support for emergency power generators, fuel cells, batteries, lighting, air conditioning, ventilation systems, grounding, safety and protection systems, sensors, and remote monitoring equipment and some incidental facilities and grounds maintenance to include mowing, vegetation control, weeding, fence and gate maintenance, access road maintenance, snow removal, and site security.  Typical NDGPS sites are being constructed at former USAF Ground Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) sites and selected new locations throughout the United States.  An average site occupies approximately 11 acres of real estate -- primarily in rural areas.  The typical NDGPS site will have three equipment shelters, miscellaneous support equipment, fire and security sensors, and safety equipment.  The primary equipment suite consists of the following items: medium frequency transmitter, antenna coupler and 300_ top-loaded guyed transmitting antenna; two GPS reference station receivers with antennas; two DGPS integrity monitor receivers with antennas; GPS antenna masts (10_ to 30_ tall); remote monitoring equipment and sensors; data router and modems; UPS and battery back-up components; emergency diesel generator, integrated fuel cell, and power transfer panel.  Security clearances will be necessary for a contractor to perform work under any future contract for the NDGPS system maintenance.  The Coast Guard is currently in the process of developing specific requirements for this maintenance program.  As of yet the type of contract has not been decided although it is anticipated that some of the maintenance may be fixed price and other work may be performed on a time and material or cost reimbursement basis.   The Coast Guard envisions the future contractor(s) having an intricate network of technicians dispersed in selected localities that could respond to a casualty within a few hours as dispatched from its central 800 call center.   Vendors should have experience with maintenance and repair of similar equipment as will be required in any potential future solicitation. No solicitation for this requirement exists; therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.   If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Government Electronic Posting System at www.eps.gov and in the CBD.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these cites for release of any future solicitation or synopsis.  Vendors having capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought synopsis including commercial market information and company information via e-mail to the Contract Specialist at jthorne@mlca.uscg.mil.   Responses should include the following information: company name, address, point of contact and phone number; business size and disadvantaged, 8(a) or HUBZone status; corporate affiliations; potential joint venture partners, teaming partners, and or major subcontractors or (prime).  All relevant input is encouraged.

The VBA is soliciting information from General Services Administration (GSA)Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Contractor's ONLY.  The approved VBA national telephone strategy focuses on telecommunications technology advancements as a way to support customer service requirements.  The VBA initiated a VIC in the Service Delivery Network (SDN) 2 area combining the customer service resources of seven regional office (RO) facilities into a seamless VIC operation.  The VIC functionality provided efficient call delivery, call control, and call management processes, which successfully supported the objectives of the VIC pilot project and the VBA business requirements.  The SDN 2 VIC pilot platform consisted of telephone systems and components acquired from ECI Telecom, Inc.  Based on the success of the SDN2 VIC, the VBA is expanding the VIC concept nationwide.  The VBA has a nationally installed base of advanced digital telephone systems from various GSA schedule manufactures, including ECI Telecom, Avaya and Nortel.  Each manufacture has asserted that they adhere to the QSIG and Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA) international interoperability standards.  Prior to VIC expansion nationwide, the VBA requires proof of the interoperability capabilities and VIC functionality that is supported by the heterogeneous digital telephone systems in a non-production environment.  This is NOT a Request for Quote.  Requests for RFQ and/or to be placed on a mailing list will NOTE be accepted.

<DESC>The government intends to use Alpha contract procedures (sole source) to place national stock numbered items manufactured solely by SPD Technologies (CAGE 30086) on a long term indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract to Jo-Kell, Inc (CAGE 5V049). SPD Technologies has identified Jo-Kell, Inc. as the sole value added distributor for government sales to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The government therefore intends to place the contract with Jo-Kell as the single authorized distributor to DLA.
         
A firm-fixed price contract is proposed for the base year. Option year pricing will be negotiated prior to each option period for a firm-fixed price for each option period. The government intends to procure these items by part number. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. The proposed procurement will contain an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total duration (base plus option years) shall not exceed 5 years.

<SUBJECT>14 -- Request for Information Relating to New or Modified Warhead
<DESC>Special Notice.  The Projects Division, Precision Strike System Programs Office (WMGD) is issuing a Request For Information (RFI) for new or modified warhead leading to a production of approximately 350 All-Up-Rounds (AUR).  They are seeking capable sources with demonstrated past performance to accomplish this effort.  This program is scheduled to begin in FY03 with two years to design, develop, and test a new or modified warhead leading to a production of approximately 350 All-Up-Rounds (AUR) beginning in FY05.  The objective of this effort is to increase the penetration, survivability, and lethality of the current design to improve the capability in defeating hard targets.  Survivability areas to be addressed are: fuze mounting hardware, payload, and case.  The resultant warhead will be incorporated into the GBU/EGBU-28 system with minimal impact to operations and logistic support.  There will be no changes to the guidance and tail kits other than minor changes to adapters, lanyards, and other miscellaneous hardware required to accommodate potential reshaping of the warhead.  Changes to mass properties will be permitted as long as those changes do not require a full flight certification program.  The designated launch platforms are the F-15E and B2 aircraft and shall require no modifications to accommodate the resultant system.  Responses to this RFI will be used by the government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  The government has developed candidate concepts for improved penetration, survivability, and lethality.  These concepts will be made available upon issuance of the Request For Proposal (RFP).  Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to submit their ideas for improving system performance in penetration, survivability, lethality, costs associated with each, and the identification of major risks.  In order for the government to implement a low risk program, the contractors are encouraged to provide responses to the following specific questions.

     1.  What are the major technical system level risks associated with the development and acquisition of new penetrator warheads?  From a system level could you rank the highest system risks as you see them?

     2.  What are the major issues to be considered in the tradeoffs between penetration, survivability, and lethality?

     3.  Are there any new materials or explosive technologies from related or unrelated applications that could be applied to the development of this warhead?  If so, what are the risks associated with incorporating these technologies.

     4.  Given this is a 2 year program, what are the major programmatic risks?

     5.  What modeling tools do you envision using to support this program?  How have these tools been validated?

     6.  Identify manufacturing risks and significant issues, if any, associated with material availability, procurement leadtimes, capital investment, and environmental constraints. 

     7.  Identify any significant issues that should be considered in the areas of logistics support, employment, deployment, operation, and sustainment.

     8.  What are the technology challenges in the development of a harder, more survivable warhead case?

     9.  Can you identify any potential proprietary or patent issues that would increase risk to design/development and or production?

THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.

<SUBJECT>RFI - GPS ANTI-JAM ANTENNA SYSTEM
<DESC>CLASSCOD AC:  Subject:  RFI DUE:  19 April 2002 POC:  John J. Berlin II The Navy plans to upgrade GPS installations on its sea and air platforms to enhance jamming resistance through use of available non-developmental-item (NDI) anti-jam antenna systems.  The Navy intends to utilize the existing GAS-1 Anti-Jam Antenna System to upgrade several air and ship platforms.  The Navy intends to work with the GPS Joint Program Office (JPO) to modify existing contract F04701-96-C-0050 to procure additional GAS-1 systems including Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) (AS-3821A/ARN, P/N 01-01664/00,1 NSN:5985-01-352-9676)  and Antenna Electronics (AE) (AS-3820C/AR, P/N 808352/000, NSN 5985-01-447-0682).  In this way the Navy utilizes an already developed, qualified nulling antenna system with established logistics process.  Working with the GPS JPO a competition for an advanced system is planned in the future.  Intended source for the current GAS-1 system is Raytheon Systems Limited of Harlow, United Kingdom.  Raytheon Systems Limited is the manufacturer of the GAS-1 and is the only known company capable of providing the production equipment.   Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement Of Capabilities (SOC) including  a technical description of the antenna system sufficient for government evaluation of the system as equivalent to the GAS-1 antenna system.
