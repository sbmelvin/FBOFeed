<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) decision to award a single source contract to Multi Electric Manufacturing, Inc. for load transfer rings. This public announcement is issued to consider firms that are capable of supplying the load transfer rings. The rings must adapt to Multi-Electric's Multi-Function Light 3950-1/2/3/4/5 (currently under FAA contract) to an L-868 size C light base. The rings must be able to withstand aircraft movement and landings. The rings cannot cause damage to any part of the aircraft (i.e. tires, etc.)The rings must also withstand snow plows thus protecting the Semi-Flush light. No part of the top surface of the Load Transfer Ring which protrudes above finished grade of the runway shall have a slope greater than 12 degrees. No part of the combined Load Transfer Ring and Semi-flush light assembly shall exceed 1/2 inch in height above the pavement. All edges above the pavement shall be rounded to not less than 1/16 inch radius. The rings must not block windows. The FAA, Air Traffic Organization, has a proposed acquisition to Multi-Electric Manufacturing, Inc. for load transfer rings needed to support the establishment of Approach Lighting Systems. There is an immediate need to establish New Approach Lighting Systems that require load transfer rings that can only be satisfied in the time required through the existing contract with Multi-Electric Manufacturing, Inc. Multi-Electric has been identified as the only source able to provide the current baselined requirement in the time required. Based on these factors the FAA contemplates a single source to Multi-Electric Manufacturing, Inc.  This announcement is NOT a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any responses received in response to this market survey.

<CONTACT>KATHLEEN MARKLEY  CONTRACT SPECIALIST  3032369325     kmarkley@usgs.gov;
<DESC>This is not an announcement of a solicitation. This is a Request for Information (RFI). The U.S. Geological Survey, National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII), is requesting information regarding vendors capable of providing a Biological Distributed Search Tool.  This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not serve as proposals, bids or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary and shall not constitute a fee to the Government.  The main purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research and determine the organizations capable for future competition.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee participation in future U.S. Geological Survey activities. RFI responses will be accepted in hard copy only.  No electronic responses, such as email or fax, will be accepted.  All proprietary and restricted information provided in response to this synopsis should be clearly marked.  Responses should indicate if the vendor is considered a large or small business.  Please ensure you have included your email address, mailing address, and telephone number in the body of the response.  The information provided should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate that the vendor understands the nature of the work involved, and has the expertise and resources to successfully perform.  All responses are limited to a three to five page narrative on eight and one half by eleven inch paper, using a 12 point font.  All responses shall be in the English language.  Responses must be received no later than 3:00 p.m., Mountain Standard Time, January 4, 2008 to the following address: U.S. Geological Survey Acquisition and Grants Branch, MS204 Attn:  Kathleen Markley Building 53, Room H1122 Denver Federal Center, 6th and Kipling Denver, CO 80225 RFI OVERVIEW The USGS National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII0(http://www.nbii.gov) is seeking to deploy a distributed search tool.  A distributed search tool will allow us to search distributed repositories of biological and ecological data/information.  This RFI will be used to survey the marketplace, identify potential innovative approaches, and gather additional requirements for a Request for Proposals (RFP) that USGS expects to issue in the near future. The NBII is a collaborative effort among federal, state, local, and foreign agencies, international and non-governmental organizations, academic institutions, and private sector groups to provide an intelligent gateway to biological data and information worldwide.  NBII is used by land managers, scientists, legislators, educators, and the general public for purposes that include land-use decisions, scientific research, policymaking, and the general information needs of its users. PROJECT BACKGROUND The need for an improved distributed search tool is due to the rapid growth of all content on the Internet and the corresponding increase in demand for biological information of all types.  The World Wide Web presents tremendous opportunities and a wealth of information to users, but the quantity of that information can be overwhelming.  The user who attempts to find information a particular species, a biological concern, species image, publication, land management plan, or additional information can be come confounded by the sheer volume of data and information available-often not relevant to the user's subject or domain of interest.  To address this dilemma, the NBII team developed a distributed search tool, BioBot(http://search.nbii.gov) in 2000, to meet these demands.  However, due to the increased complexity of the biological community, increased user expectations, and a need to improve the delivery of biological data and information, the NBII is seeking an alternative search tool to support its management, retrieval, and delivery needs. DESIRABLE FEATURES The NBII is designed to provide access to a number of local and distributed electronic resources in both a secure and un-secure method.  These resources can be structured data, unstructured data, and/or contain summary metadata.  Typical target resources are:  technical reports, case studies, datasets, journal articles, management plans, proceedings, images, fact sheets, or other biological web resources.  Resources may or may not contain summary metadata (i.e. meta-tags or typical Office Automation Property tags). Resources may or may not conform to NBII Program standards including: Dublin Core, Federal Geographic Data Committee Biological Data Profile, Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Standards, and various local schemas or standards (http://metada.nbii.gov). The NBII Biological Distributed Search Tool must provide advanced, user friendly search features to support the NBII Program's overall goals and objectives.  These desirable search features are briefly summarized below to allow all vendors, reseller, and integrators to respond as to their ability to provide these desirable features.  These features are not in priority order. 1. Full-text, fielded, and Boolean searching of un-structured and structured content 2. Sharing results and/or index content in RSS and other common interchange formats 3. Customization of the user interface, via an open API, for user defined and system presentation of search results into tabs, folders, geographic view, or other groupings.  This includes the ability to support multiple Search User Interfaces, with potentially different UI presentation of query input and results, for different audience types. 4. Provide automatic clustering of search results based on dynamic content results or other various methods. 5. Inclusion of "multi-collections" or "views" of information for querying and searching by users. 6. Incorporation of an NBII-base provided, underlying thesaurus to aid users in the selection of terms and the system in the broadening or narrowing of query terms.  This can be accomplished via web-services, SKOS, and general SQL. 7. Integrate various web-services, for query expansion or field lookups, to improve user provided terms and automatic suggestion of terms.  Examples would include the NBII supported Integrated Taxonomic Information System (IT IS) to support species information, AJAX based user suggested terms, and gazetteers to support place name lookups. 8.  Spell checking of user provided query terms. 9. More "like" or "see similar results" query expansion. 10.  Crawl/Harvest and index, via schedules and automated settings, various content formats including: xml, html, .txt, and typical office automation formats (.doc, .ppt, .pdf, .xls, etc).  This also includes the ability to crawl and index various sql compliant database management systems, Open Archives Initiative (OAI) supported repositories, and standard web-services.  Desired is the ability to manually control the crawler radius, as well as the capability to create inclusion and exclusion rules, both within the target domain and for external links; automatic scheduling of crawls/jobs; ability to crawl secure/controlled sites; and support automatic generation/extraction of metadata properties on targeted documents. 11. Map or cross-walk metadata properties to other formats in support of user retrieval and presentation of search results. 12. Customization of the search engine ranking algorithm based upon weightings of metadata fields and weighting of "Reliable/High Quality/Trusted" sources. 13. Retrieval and indexing of up to ten (10) million documents or items.  Response time should be no more than three (3) seconds. 14.  ADA and 508 compliant 15.  Compliance with NIST Security guidelines and requirements. 16. Administrative and Management report tools. 17.  Additional unique Vendor provided features: 18.  Ongoing support, maintenance, training, and example best practices of implementation by other federal organizations. INFORMATION REQUESTED Each prospective vendor, reseller, or integrator shall provide the following information: A. General information on the search tool products(s), capabilities, and functionalities.  This would include white papers, marketing materials, or other product information. B. A three to five page narrative, 8  x 11 paper size, 12 point font, addressing the List of Desirable Features to describe specifically how the products and/or services meet the requirements. C.  Any additional capabilities, requirements, or innovative approaches relevant to the discovery, management, delivery, and visualization of biological data and information.

The Contractor will also be responsible for survey weight and estimation variable development and construction as well as analytic file development, including documentation and codebooks. The contract will be performance based for an initial period of performance of three and one-half years with three three-year options and four options for product delivery, under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541720.
 
The primary objective of the MEPS HC is to provide high quality data that can be used to produce both point estimates as well as distributional estimates of health care use, medical expenditures, health insurance status and sources of payment for medical care.  In addition, the MEPS HC is designed to produce measures of health care quality associated with several high prevalence conditions.  The health care services use, medical expenditures, and health insurance data can also be linked to the demographic, employment, economic, and health status of survey participants.  The longitudinal feature of the MEPS HC permits analyses of transitions in health insurance coverage, health status, and other characteristics over a two year period. Offerors must meet requirements of the Pro-Children Act of 1994, Buy American Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Privacy Act, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), federal policy for the protection of human research subjects (45CFR46) which will include an Institutional Review Board (IRB) review, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

Tasks will revolve around the MEPS-HC which collects detailed information on health care use and payment for health care services from a nationally representative sample of the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population.  In the MEPS HC, data are collected for each new sample panel of households to cover a two-year period, and a new panel is started each year.  To produce health care estimates for a calendar year, data are combined across two distinct nationally representative MEPS HC samples.  More specifically, annual estimates are based on data from the first year of a current panel combined with data from the second year of a previous year?s panel.

Offerors must demonstrate in their proposal they possess expertise in data collection (computer assisted and paper and pencil), statistical and analytical editing and imputation, survey weight and estimation variable development and construction, as well as analytical file development and documentation.  Offerors must possess and demonstrate the following capabilities:  a) sample implementation and documentation; b) development of weights and variables for variance estimation; c) development of sampling unit data (geo-coding); d) development of materials and CAPI maintenance; e) interviewer recruitment and training for Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, Round 4, and  Round 5; f) data collection for Round 1, Round  2, Round 3, Round 4, and Round 5; g) Spanish interviewer training and materials development; h) data processing; i) development of security plan; j) between round processing; k) forms control and receipt; l) data entry; m) data coding; and n) preparation and delivery of analytic files including archival versions of the full operational database, and point-in-time, full year use, full year use and expenditure, event, condition, jobs and a appendix files.  Offeror?s proposals must also demonstrate their understanding and knowledge of how to develop an overall plan for coordinating deliverables including data files and materials between the HC and MPC (Medical Provider Component ? to be a separate requirement) contractors, particularly those occurring concurrently or in a linked manner; integration of CAPI applications, post data collection processing, and analytic editing and imputation tasks; the statistical and substantive soundness of the data editing and imputation techniques proposed; the soundness of proposed weighting and variance estimation strategies and strategies to maximize survey response and minimize non-response bias; and  the soundness of the data management plan.  Examples of all of the above will be requested in the resultant RFP.   

The MEPS-HC is to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as data collection (computer assisted and paper questionnaires) from household respondents of demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and sources of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment information.  In addition, it is anticipated that offerors proposal will demonstrate they have the expertise and experience in developing analytic files, including documentation of public use files, as well as survey weight and variance estimation development and construction, and analytical and statistical data editing and imputation. A PMI-certified Project Manager is required as well as demonstrated ability to provide EVM information. In the event that the MEPS core staff does not include particular expertise needed to accomplish a particular task, the contractor must demonstrate their capability to obtain such expertise through consultants and/or subcontracts.  Subcontracting to meet the DHHS? socio economic goals must be included in offeror?s proposals. Potential offerors are encouraged to visit the MEPS website at www.meps.ahrq.gov .  Specific files and reports to assist understanding of the requirement will be available via CD ROM, after the solicitation is issued. Instructions will be in the solicitation.

Only LMC has the unique knowledge base, the facilities, and the experienced personnel necessary to successfully conduct the work.

Additionally, the algorithms developed by LMC represent many work years under other LMC/DOD contracts and LMC's own independent research and development (IRAD).  The algorithms are very sophisticated and require specialized knowledge to use properly thus another vendor cannot easily or cost-!  effectively duplicate them.  Results will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 334511 applies.

<DESC>The Exploration Systems Mission Directorate's (ESMD) at NASA/JSC has a requirement to understand and develop 3D sensors to autonomously observe and characterize hazards for autonomous landings on the moon.   The purpose of this synopsis is to inform industry of NASA?s intent to award a sole source purchase for Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) 3D Optical Sensor Support to FastMetrix, Inc. As apart of this requirement the contractor will be responsible for contributing and providing Sensor Systems inputs as required by NASA JSC.  The inputs will include descriptions of technology needs, simulation and test analytic models and processes, assessment of candidate sensor systems, systems development activities and plans, and verification and validation plans and procedures.  The contractor shall employ experience and knowledge of current laser technology, detector technology, sensor signal processing, Scan and Flash LIDAR technology, and sensor performance analysis in this work.	 FastMetrix has been performing work on the ESMD ALHAT sensor project for the past 18 months under DARPA contract NNJ06HC24I.  As such, FastMetrix has unique and intimate knowledge of LIDAR sensors for Rendezvous and Docking and Thermal Protection System inspection applications in Space Shuttle missions, as well as optical 3D sensor expertise development that will be applicable to human lunar missions (including crew and cargo placement); robotic lunar missions; accurate landing for surface rendezvous including landing near small areas of scientific interest; safe, autonomous, and accurate landing of crewed and non-crewed missions; autonomous hazard detection and avoidance; polar and deep-crater landings, as well as expanded landing windows without lighting restrictions; and real-time capability to detect landing hazards and relay safe landing information to the crew. Due to this experience the FastMetrix workforce has the critical skills that are required to continue support of the new Constellation Program.  Continuing with FastMetrix will ensure the safety and the success of the Constellation Program.  Furthermore, FastMetrix is the only known contractor in the US that has direct experience, familiarity, and expertise with each LIDAR sensor that is currently being developed, or has been developed in the US and Europe. A request for information to industry (RFI Notice # 121343-SOL-001-001 ? Sensors for Lunar Landing System) resulted in the evaluation of 26 RFI responses. Fact finding site visits found that while various suppliers are capable of providing expertise in particular sensory and concept fields; no single supplier other than FastMetrix can offer the comprehensive expertise in every field of sensory and laser systems that fulfill NASA?s requirements. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1 p.m. local time on December 18, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Office of Clinical Research Affairs (OCRA) of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to recompete a requirement for capabilities and facilities to establish and manage a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) to support NIAID sponsored clinical research programs in infectious diseases.  This is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE,  NAICS 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period with performance beginning on or about March 3, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 40.75 FTEs.    

The NIAID, DMID supports extramural research to understand and ultimately prevent and/or treat diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than HIV that threaten millions of lives every year.  This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  DMID is also responsible for advancing clinical research and conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic agents against potential bioterrorist pathogens and new and re-emerging infectious diseases of public health importance, such as avian influenza and SARS.    

The primary goal of this seven-year effort is to facilitate the evaluation of new vaccines, other prophylactic strategies, and therapeutic agents for infectious diseases of priority to the Division.  Support will be provided for single- and multi-center Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials of vaccines, other biologics, therapeutic agents aimed at bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases that occur in people of all ages at DMID-sponsored Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs) and other clinical research centers.  The contractor's primary goal will be to coordinate clinical trials with respect to elements of study planning and logistics, training and communications, data collection, management and analysis and related support activities.  This will typically involve a multi-center effort and a collaborative relationship with clinical investigators, other supporting contractors and DMID staff.  

The support services to be provided by the contractor under this contract include the following: 1) computerized systems for the collection, management, storage, security, reporting and quality control of study data including systems to accommodate on-line subject enrollment and randomization; 2) statistical expertise in study design and analysis of trials; 3) assistance with preparation of study-related materials such as Manuals of Operations, case report forms and/or source documents and tracking logs; 4) development and maintenance of protocol web sites to share information and study materials with study sites and to provide DMID with real-time study information, such as overall and site-specific accrual, demographics, adverse events, queries, and deviations; 5) development and maintenance of an electronic inventory system to identify and track clinical study specimens; 6) providing training to clinical site staff to access the data system, perform remote data entry and enter clinical specimens into the electronic inventory system; 7) assessing capabilities and providing assistance to sites that intend to perform their own data collection, management, security and quality control; and 8) serving as a repository to store data from completed studies.

The Request for Proposal document will be available electronically on or about December 21, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps <http://www.fedbizopps.gov/>.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile or e-mail transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

UTE COAL FIRED POWER PLANT PROJECT
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a 300MW to 400MW coal-fired power plant for Uruguay's National Administration for Electric Supply and Transmission (Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones Electricas, UTE) 

UTE is interested in the development of an estimated $560 million 300MW to 400MW coal-fired power plant as a cost-effective method to meeting energy needs during periods of drought.  According to UTE, there are no longer potential sites to build additional hydroelectric plants, or to add reservoirs to existing hydroelectric plants that would allow UTE to expand domestic production.

The proposed coal fired power plant will become the first thermal unit to be dispatched, thus lowering the marginal costs of electricity in the system.  UTE lacks the technical expertise that is needed to thoroughly analyze the feasibility of this alternative and is looking for U.S. expertise in clean coal technologies.  The proposed feasibility study will provide UTE with the necessary implementation plan and requisite technical expertise needed to properly evaluate the development of a project of this magnitude.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $419,729 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></b>  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 1:00pm (local time), January 16, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The FBI has a requirement for information technology support services to include personnel and facilities to design, develop, maintain, enhance and provide operational support for automated systems that are, or will be, resident on mainframes, minicomputers, servers and microcomputers.  This acquisition will be titled: ITOD Task Order Contract (ITOC).  ITOC will provide a full range of information technology support services.  The full scope of information technology services will be defined in the ITOC solicitation document.  This acquisition will be conducted as a small business set-aside solicitation with multiple awards under anticipated NAICS codes of 541511, 541512, 541513 and 541519 for which the size standard is $23,000,000 in annual receipts.  It is anticipated that the FBI will award up to ten (10) contract awards from the single solicitation document.  The contracts awarded will be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts utilizing fixed hourly labor rates with provisions for the award of future task orders that may consist of multiple contract types.  Awardees of base contracts will be required to compete for future task orders issued by the FBI.  Task orders issued under the ITOC contract will require assigned personnel to have active Top Secret security clearances issued and/or revalidated within the last 5 years.  Personnel clearances require at least 5 years of U.S. citizenship, absence of a felony record, no history of drug abuse, and a good credit record.  This is necessary for access to FBI mainframe computers and/or to have unescorted access to FBI buildings.  Prime contractors must also have or be able to quickly obtain a Top Secret facility clearance.  The FBI reserves the right to invite Offerors not possessing the requested facility clearance, but having the ability to obtain one, to submit proposals.  In addition to required written proposals, oral proposals may be utilized to present an Offeror?s present technical capabilities and business management approach.  These are two (2) of the areas that will be evaluated in accordance with the factors contained in the full ITOC solicitation.  Contracts awarded will be for a base period that ends on 9/30/2008, four (4) optional one (1) year periods, and a final option period, with the length of the contract not to exceed 60 months.  The maximum dollar amount that may be awarded to all contractors during the 60 month contract period of ITOC is $175,000,000.  All contractors responding to the solicitation must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry.  The solicitation will be available through the Fedbizopps website.  The solicitation will be available via this website on or around 10/22/2007 with no hard copies being issued.  The closing date for receipt of proposals will be specified in the RFP document.

<CONTACT>Deborah Baca, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4490, Fax null, Email dbaca@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>NOTICE HAS BEEN REVISED TO CHANGE ANTICIPATED POSTING DATE OF RFP FROM DECEMBER 21, 2006 TO JANUARY 2, 2007.

The Office of Clinical Research Affairs (OCRA) of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to recompete a requirement for capabilities and facilities to establish and manage a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) to support NIAID sponsored clinical research programs in infectious diseases.  This is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE,  NAICS 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year period with performance beginning on or about March 3, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 40.75 FTEs.    

The NIAID, DMID supports extramural research to understand and ultimately prevent and/or treat diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than HIV that threaten millions of lives every year.  This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  DMID is also responsible for advancing clinical research and conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic agents against potential bioterrorist pathogens and new and re-emerging infectious diseases of public health importance, such as avian influenza and SARS.    

The primary goal of this seven-year effort is to facilitate the evaluation of new vaccines, other prophylactic strategies, and therapeutic agents for infectious diseases of priority to the Division.  Support will be provided for single- and multi-center Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials of vaccines, other biologics, therapeutic agents aimed at bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases that occur in people of all ages at DMID-sponsored Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEUs) and other clinical research centers.  The contractor's primary goal will be to coordinate clinical trials with respect to elements of study planning and logistics, training and communications, data collection, management and analysis and related support activities.  This will typically involve a multi-center effort and a collaborative relationship with clinical investigators, other supporting contractors and DMID staff.  

The support services to be provided by the contractor under this contract include the following: 1) computerized systems for the collection, management, storage, security, reporting and quality control of study data including systems to accommodate on-line subject enrollment and randomization; 2) statistical expertise in study design and analysis of trials; 3) assistance with preparation of study-related materials such as Manuals of Operations, case report forms and/or source documents and tracking logs; 4) development and maintenance of protocol web sites to share information and study materials with study sites and to provide DMID with real-time study information, such as overall and site-specific accrual, demographics, adverse events, queries, and deviations; 5) development and maintenance of an electronic inventory system to identify and track clinical study specimens; 6) providing training to clinical site staff to access the data system, perform remote data entry and enter clinical specimens into the electronic inventory system; 7) assessing capabilities and providing assistance to sites that intend to perform their own data collection, management, security and quality control; and 8) serving as a repository to store data from completed studies.

The Request for Proposal document will be available electronically on or about January 2, 2007, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps <http://www.fedbizopps.gov/>.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile or e-mail transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is seeking contractors capable of  providing comprehensive statistical support, data management and analysis activities for DMID-sponsored clinical work.  This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts. The evaluation of new and improved vaccine and therapeutic candidates in clinical trials and clinical studies is an essential element of DMID efforts.  Through an extensive network of grant and contract research programs, DMID supports a broad range of clinical research, including single-site and multi-center Phase I, II, III and IV clinical trials of bacterial, viral and parasitic vaccines, therapeutics, and other biologics and drugs as preventive and therapeutic measures against infectious diseases in people of all ages and risk categories. Support is also provided for a variety of other studies, including:  targeted surveillance for pathogens of interest in study populations; evaluations of novel investigational product delivery systems; and reevaluation of current vaccine formulations, schedules and modes of delivery.  Clinical trials and clinical studies are also supported to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm), and to meet critical public health needs and opportunities for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza. 

The Contractor must be capable of establishing and managing a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) to support DMIDs extramural clinical research programs through the provision of: statistical design and analysis expertise; computerized systems for the collection, storage, management, reporting and quality control of study data; assistance in the preparation of study-related materials and instructions; a system for the tracking of clinical specimens; training of clinical site staff and assessment of clinical site capabilities for data collection and management; and a data repository for completed DMID-sponsored clinical studies. The contractor must also be capable of facilitating the evaluation of new vaccines and other prophylactic and therapeutic agents of priority to the DMID by providing data coordination and related research support functions for Division-sponsored multi-center Phase I, II, III and IV clinical trials.  The multi-faceted goal of this effort would be to provide sound study design, facilitate study implementation in accordance with clinical and regulatory guidelines, provide for secure and efficient data management, and to perform data analysis.  Specifically, the Contractors must be capable of serving as a coordinating center for DMID clinical and epidemiologic studies with respect to elements of study design, planning and logistics, training and communications, data collection, management and analysis and related support activities.  This typically would involve a multi-center effort and a collaborative relationship among clinical investigators, other supporting Contractors and DMID staff.  The Contractor would review clinical protocols and provide recommendations concerning study design, primary and secondary endpoints, power calculations and sample size.  The contractor would also design case report forms, write procedure manuals for study implementation, perform all programming for data management and analysis and generate reports for studies conducted under a variety of contract and grant mechanisms.  The contractor provides training to site staff for on-line enrollment and randomization of study subjects, remote electronic data entry into the web-based data management systems.

 A contractor must also have the capability to develop and manage interfaces among existing data systems and maintains numerous websites. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise: The ability to collect, manage and control the quality of clinical and laboratory data;  The ability to design, manage, update and ensure secure access to clinical study materials and data in real time; The ability to design, manage, update and ensure secure access to Clinical Study Website(s); The ability to carry out statistical design and analysis functions; The ability to design and manage an electronic specimen tracking system; The ability to provide clinical sites training, assessment and technical assistance; And the education, training, experience, expertise, qualifications, including, statistical leadership for the design, development, implementation, and analysis of all phases of clinical trials for the evaluation of candidate vaccines of the proposed Principal Investigator.

<SUBJECT>70 -- IBM Memory Upgrade
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure brand name memory upgrade for existing IBM P-Series servers installed in its data center facilities.     This announcement is considered a brand name justification.     This is not a solicitation.     This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE CONDUCTED UTILIZING EXISTING USPTO'S INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANITY (ID/IQ) CONTRACTS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.    

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) currently have several deployments of critical production applications running under IBM?s AIX platform, in compliance with the OMB Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA).  Supporting Activities of the FEA include 1) development of a core set of standardized Component-Based Architecture models to facilitate technology solutions and the development of a complete architecture (baseline, target, and transition) for each of the 24 Presidential Priority E-Government initiatives and 2) the assessment and identification - through high-level architectural, critical success factor, and Line of Business performance information - of new opportunities for business process and system consolidation to improve government efficiency and effectiveness.  The USPTO has committed to aligning its Enterprise Architecture (EA) efforts with the OMB FEA framework.

Beginning in 2003, USPTO/OCIO evaluated and choose the IBM AIX platform for its Application Middleware and Oracle consolidated server farms.  In the effort to provide a more cost effective and dynamically scalable infrastructure to meet the needs of our customers we need to continue to embrace new technology as required when it make sense to do so.  With the need to add additional resources for new projects planning to modernize the aging application code, we can also take advantage of the newest technology to minimize unused resources.  This new technology allows for the virtualization of machines that are configured to be flexible and scalable to provide the USPTO with the ability to leverage new workload management features that are imbedded in the p5 and AIX 5.3 technology.  This new technology is much more flexible and is currently running in our Test and Production environments.  The USPTO requires an increase in the server resources (memory upgrade) within the P-series Enterprise class servers.  The increase in resources are planned to provide for a higher level of availability and stability for our Development, System Integration testing, Formal testing, and Production.  These resources will be installed into existing servers.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, New York District is scheduled to hold an industry briefing meeting on 17 December 2007 at 10 AM on an upcoming project. The meeting will be held at 26 Federal Plaza, Room 2120. The purpose of the briefing is to partner with the industry in development of the plans and specs for a beach renourishment project in Long Branch, NJ, in order to increase the quality of the project and reduce the risk to the contractor and the government .   At the request of the NJ Department of Environmental Protection, the Long Branch, NJ beach renourishment project has an additional  feature, a somewhat triangularly shaped feeder beach (in plan layout), which will require the placement of renourishment mat erial farther offshore than typically constructed as part of the construction template.

The Bid schedule will include options  strictly for the shaped feeder beach feature, in addition to options needed for the overall quantity of the renourishment project.   Comments from representative contractors in the industry will be used to refine the plans and specs and improve biddability and constructability of the project.

Description:  

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), 875 Fifteenth Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20005, intends to acquire medical assistance services for its personnel traveling and living abroad.

As such, the U.S. Embassy serves as the first point of contact in most emergency situations.  If a traveler is injured, becomes ill or is deemed mentally unstable and adequate medical care is not available, the selected contractor will work in tandem with the U.S. Embassy medical staff, when such staff is available.  Final decisions on medical evacuations able to MCC are to be in joint consultation between the contractor, the U.S. Embassy medical staff and if possible the injured party or his/her guardian.

The following services are not required but are HIGHLY DESIRABLE:
The countries to which MCC permanently assigns its employees are considered inadequate for safe births.

The medical evacuation includes the pregnant female and minor children that the spouse remaining in country is unable to care for.

Deliverables:

A.  The contractor will provide standard ID cards and program descriptions to MCC for each covered employee.

B.  If a traveler is left alone or hospitalized for more than 7 days, the contractor will coordinate for a family member to join them.

C.  If minor children are left unattended due to a medical emergency, the contractor will coordinate their return home, accompanied by a qualified escort if necessary.

D.  If a traveler should pass away while on official travel, the contractor will arrange for their remains to be returned to their permanent residence.

E.  The contractor will facilitate the transfer of medication, vaccines and blood products if unsafe or unavailable in country.

F.  The contractor will provide the following medical assistance services:

-  In the event of illness of injury, the contractor will make new reservations for airlines, hotels and other travel services as needed.
-  The contractor will assist in replacing passports, tickets and other important documents.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to revise Section "Description" of the original Solicitation and publish questions and answers relative to this Solicitation.

Specifically, the Solicitation is amended as follows:

1.  The section entitled "Description" is hereby replaced with the following:

"Description:  

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), 875 Fifteenth Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20005, intends to acquire medical evacuation services and medical assistance services for its personnel traveling and living abroad.  The purpose of this Statement of Work is to obtain emergency medical assistance services 24 hours/7 days a week when the traveler and/or eligible family member is 100 or miles away from their permanent residence on official travel or a permanent assignment.  The following is a sampling of the countries in which travel may occur:

Armenia, Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Dominican Republic, East Timor, Ecuador, Georgia, Ghana, Honduras, Jordan, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Moldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, United States, Vanuatu.

A medical emergency is defined as physical, mental and/or natal.  

All MCC employees and their eligible family members traveling on official temporary duty orders or official permanent assignment orders are under the direct jurisdiction of the U.S. Ambassador.  As such, the U.S. Embassy serves as the first point of contact in most emergency situations.  If a traveler is injured, becomes ill or is deemed mentally unstable and adequate medical care is not available, the selected contractor will work in tandem with the U.S. Embassy medical staff, when such staff is available.  Final decisions on medical evacuations for MCC employees and eligible family members are to be made in joint consultation between the contractor, the U.S. Embassy medical staff and if possible the injured party or his/her guardian.

The following services are not required but are HIGHLY DESIRABLE:
The countries to which MCC permanently assigns its employees are considered inadequate for safe births.  All pregnant personnel must be medically evacuated for a period of three months - six weeks prior to and six weeks post birth.   The medical evacuation includes the pregnant female and minor children that the spouse remaining in country is unable to care for."

2.  The MCC received five questions about this Solicitation.  The questions and the MCC's responses are provided below.

Question 1:  Is there currently a program in place and if so, do you have the utilization statistics?
Answer 1:  Please see the answer to Question 4 for more information regarding current program.  Also, MCC intends to increase the number of participants by adding eligible family members.  See the section entitled "Estimate Population Covered" of the Solicitation for more detail information.

Question 2:  The Solicitation states that the Contractor would work in coordination with the U.S. Embassy staff to determine if a medical evacuation is necessary.  If it is determined that the evacuation is necessary, is the Contractor expected to just make arrangements or make arrangements and provide funding for the evacuation?
Answer 2:  All evacuation costs shall be covered by the Contractor.  Please also see revised section entitled "Description", above.

Question 3:  Please provide bidders list.
Answer 3:  A bidders list does not exist for this requirement.

Question 4:  What are main differences between old Statement of Work and the current one or the old contract number, title, award date of when this project was last performed/managed?  What is the name of the person (incumbent) or entity currently performing the contract/project?
Answer 4:  MCC has current contract with the Medex Assistance.  The contract number is MCC-05-0002-CFO and the title is "Medical Assistance Services".  The award date is November 1, 2004.
Main differences between old Statement of Work and the current one are:
- Including eligible family members;
- Specifically citing mental illness as a justification for medical evacuation;
- Requiring Contractor to work with the U.S. Embassy when there is a U.S. Embassy; and
- Requesting for medical evacuation for maternity purposes.

Question 5:  Due to the public benefit of these requests, etc. we know that Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is not required here.  However, if you do, please provide us answers which you think are NOT covered by FOIA and also give us e-mail, fax number of the FOIA office on this project.
Answer 5:  Answers have been provided for all questions.


All other terms and conditions of the original Solicitation MCC-08-0014-RFQ-79 remains in full force and effect.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 02 is to extend the deadline for offers to 5:00 p.m., EDT., on October 24, 2007.

Specifically, last paragraph of Solicitation is hereby replaced with the following:

"Offers are to be received by no later than 5:00 p.m., EDT, on October 24, 2007, at Millennium Challenge Corporation, 875 Fifteenth Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20005.  Fax or e-mail quotes are also acceptable.  Fax number: (202) 521-3947 or e-mail: evansoo@mcc.gov.  Point of Contact: Olena O. Evans, Contract Specialist (phone: 202-521-3647)."
range for their purchase and transportation.  
Answer 9:  The requirement is to facilitate the transfer.

Question 10:  Under the Deliverables heading, item F. refers to several service tasks the contractor is expected to perform, including making reservations for airlines, hotels, and other travel services; assist in replacing passports, tickets, and other important documents; providing immediate translation services; and arranging for the replacement of corrective lenses or medical devices. Once again, is contractor expected to pay for the above items, including tickets, hotel rooms, or new eyeglasses without any reimbursement from the MCC or traveler themselves?  
Answer 10:  The RFP states that these are services that the contractor should provide, with no expectation of the company covering the actual costs of the items.

Question 11:  Also under item F., it states that the contractor will provide medical referrals for worldwide medical and dental care. Is the selection of physicians and dentists, and the payment of the medical and dental bill, the obligation of the contractor or the patient?  
Answer 11:  The requirement is to provide the services of referring physicians and dentists and assisting with any payment problems.  The actual payment is the responsibility of the individual. 

Question 12:  Will the MCC provide a list of employees and eligible family members to the contractor prior to beginning the term of the agreement? Will the list include pertinent information related to emergency contacts, medical history, permanent and temporary residences, primary care physicians, and other medical information? Is there any upper age limit to the population covered?  
Answer 12:  No.

Question 13:  Is the contractor under any specific obligation to deploy their own personnel if at all possible to accompany the sick or injured traveler during their evacuation from their point of origin all the way back to their destination hospital? Frequently, international medical evacuations may require multiple carriers and transfers of the patient from service to service as they are brought across the globe back to their home hospital of choice. With these transfers of care, it is frequently advantageous and medically appropriate to have a "medical escort" who can accompany the patient from start to finish making sure they are getting the finest level of care. Is this something that the MCC would require of their contractor?  
Answer 13:  No.

Question 14:  This RFP seems to specify that you are just looking for a contractor who can provide a "hospital-to-hospital" evacuation. Is there any specific requirement for search and rescue capability? What would happen if one of your travelers was in a remote region and became ill or injured? Would you like the contractor to have the ability to provide their own search and rescue personnel to perform an actual field evacuation of the traveler, or would you just leave it to the injured party to try and perform their own self-rescue to get to a hospital for eventual evacuation? If possible, should these search and rescue personnel have any specific background experience, such as military special-forces, and should they be actual direct employees of the contractor, or would you accept whatever local provider a contractor can pull out of a phonebook? 
Answer 14:  Search and rescue are not a requirement under the Statement of Work.  However, the contractor should have the ability to provide whatever needs of transport is required - with appropriate medical support - to move the injured party from a remote location to an appropriate medical venue.


2.  Last paragraph of Solicitation is hereby replaced with the following:

<DESC>The purposes of this Amendment are to:
1.	Publish questions and answers relative to this Solicitation; and
2.	Extend the deadline for offers to 5:00 p.m., EDT, on October 29, 2007.

NO MORE QUESTIONS ARE ALLOWED BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AMENDMENT AND THE DEADLINE FOR OFFERS.

Specifically, this Solicitation is amended as follows:

1.  The questions and the MCC?s responses are provided below.

Question 1:  Section entitled "Description".  In the third paragraph, you state "A medical emergency is defined as physical, mental, and/or natal." We would like to suggest that you augment this statement with language that will define when an evacuate needs to occur. A suggestion would be to follow this with "a physical, mental, and/or natal condition in which either the person is currently hospitalized in an in-patient capacity, or has a condition which requires in-patient hospitalization." This definition would establish a finite criterion for evacuation and avoid the issue of having a mandated evacuation for a person who just needs limited out-patient treatment (sutures, blood tests, etc.) where an evacuation would not be medically appropriate.  
Answer 1:  The third paragraph will remain unchanged.  

Question 2:  In the following paragraph, you reference the term "eligible family members". Can we have a description of who the MCC considers to be eligible? Is this just the spouse or dependant children of an MCC employee, or does it extend to the employee's siblings, parents, and other relatives that might be visiting them in their host country? 
Answer 2:  An eligible family member refers to the individual's dependent children and spouse.  

Question 3:  Towards the end of that paragraph, it is specified that the "final decision on medical evacuations for MCC employees and eligible family members are to be made in joint consultation between the contractor, the U.S. Embassy medical staff, and if possible the injured party or his/her guardian." There is no language in the current RFP specifying that the final choice destination hospital be made by the patient (or the patient's emergency contact person if the patient is incapacitated). We suggest that the decision making be in the hands of the patient, with the assistance of the U.S. Embassy medical staff, eligible family members, and the patient's current attending physician and their own home primary care physician as it relates to choice of destination hospital. The contractor should also be responsible for providing expert-level medical advisory services from a top-50 U.S. Hospital to assist the patient in making this decision. This will ensure that the patient has the right to determine and be transported to wherever the best medical care for their condition can be obtained. There is also no specific language calling for evacuation back to the United States. Without language such as this, the contractor can elect to transport the patient to the least expensive destination, perhaps not even back to their home country. The notion of "closest appropriate hospital", as defined by a contractor, could be one that just provides "adequate" care which could result in the patient receiving a lower quality of care than they deserve. The nightmare of a sick MCC employee stationed in Mongolia, for example, would only get magnified by their evacuation to "the closest appropriate hospital" in Kazakhstan, as could be currently allowed by the RFP as written.  
Answer 3:  The evacuation does not need to be back to the United States but to the closest appropriate hospital.  The U.S. Embassy will determine the "closest appropriate hospital."  

Question 4:  Is there a limit to the number of possible evacuations per employee or family member per year? Similarly, is there a cap limit to how much the contractor would be expected to spend per evacuation? Most standard agreements specify no more than two evacuations per person per year and a cap of $500,000 per evacuation. (The most expensive evacuations do not cost over $250,000, so this amount should be more than adequate.)  
Answer 4:  A single person could, in theory, have multiple evacuations.  This is, however, unlikely since anyone living abroad must receive a medical clearance before going back overseas.  A person traveling on TDY should not be limited to the number of evacuations.

Question 5:  In the section identified as a service that is "Highly Desirable", can you specify where the pregnant person and her dependant children need to be evacuated to? Once again, we suggest that language is included that indicates the destination be the patient's choice. Of course, a woman in her third trimester of pregnancy does not necessarily require in-patient hospitalization. We would like to suggest that the evacuation destination be the closest appropriate commercial airport to the employee?s permanent home address. We would also like to suggest that the father-to-be also be evacuated back to their home airport (if it is possible for him based on his workload) a few days prior to the expected due date to be available during the birth of his child. We also would like to ask if the MCC is expecting the contractor to pay the cost of the return transportation for the mother, dependants, and father/employee back to the host country after the six-week post-birth period has elapsed.  
Answer 5:  The pregnant employee or pregnant spouse has the option of going to a MCC designated site or to return to the United States.  Preferred would be for the contractor to cover medevac costs to/from point of birth for pregnant employee or spouse and dependent children.  

Question 6:  Under the Deliverables heading, item B. states the contractor will coordinate for a family member to join a traveler who is left alone or hospitalized for more than 7 days. Does this mean the contractor is expected to pay the costs of transporting this family member? Is the contractor responsible for hotel arrangements and costs and per diem expense costs for this family member? Is the contractor responsible for the costs of returning this family member back to their point-of-departure when they are ready to be returned or after the traveler is discharged?  
Answer 6:  The vendor should include what they are prepared to offer.

Question 7:  Under the Deliverables heading, item C. states the contractor will coordinate for the return home any minor children left unattended due to a medical emergency and provide a qualified escort if necessary. Again, does the term "coordinate" mean the contractor is expected to pay for these transportation costs or simply arrange them and pass the invoice on to MCC or the family? Is the contractor responsible for the costs of returning the minor children back to the host country if the medical issue resolves and the parents wish for their children's return? Can you define "qualified escort"? Should this escort be an actual deployable employee of the contractor with advanced medical and/or military training who can safeguard the minor children until they are reunited with their family?  
Answer 7:  The vendor should include what they are prepared to offer.

Question 8:  Under the Deliverables heading, item D. states that a traveler's mortal remains should be returned to their permanent residence. We would suggest this statement be amended to state "permanent residence or other place designated by their estate." (This would allow remains to be transported only once in the event that a family would like their deceased buried in a location other than their current permanent residence.)
Answer 8:  The vendor should include what they are prepared to offer.

Question 9:  Under the Deliverables heading, item E. states the contractor will facilitate the transfer of medication, vaccines, and blood products as necessary. Again, can you state whether or not the contractor is expected to pay for either the products themselves or their shipping, or just ar

3.0.     OPERATING ENVIRONMENT HARDWARE

3.1.     CURRENT OPERATING SYSTEM

The operating environment consists of six Hewlett-Packard (HP) AlphaServer clusters and one stand-alone systems development and management AlphaServer.  Design philosophy is based to the maximum extent possible on the no-single-point-of-failure concept and server clustering is employed to permit the orderly failover of services to surviving cluster members in the event of system failure.

Each cluster is connected via dual fibre channel fabrics to an HP storage area network (SAN) with redundant array controllers and disks fully mirrored across device buses and shelves.  Tape backups (nightly on-site database and weekly off-site full system) are performed on all but one of the clusters to a tape library attached to one of the fibre channel fabrics.  HP Tru64 UNIX and TruCluster Server 5.1b-3 and subsequent patches, plus HP proprietary diagnostic and management tools at the current revision level, are installed on every single-system-image cluster and stand-alone system.

Oracle9i Enterprise Edition with Real Application Clusters (RAC) and Partitioning software at the current patch level is installed once on each of the four clusters with multi-instance databases and Oracle9i Enterprise Edition only is installed on the other two clusters and on the stand-alone system.  The HP Java Software Development Kit 1.4.2-6 is installed on every cluster and stand-alone system.  EMC/Legato NetWorker 7.x.x Power Edition with EMC/Legato Module for Oracle 4.x.x (or higher) with the appropriate type and number of Legato Cluster Client, Legato Dedicated Storage Node, and Legato Autochanger Module licenses are installed on the five clusters equipped with a tape library.

A middle server tier for each cluster provides client connectivity and consists of one or more dual servers running Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition with Oracle10g Infrastructure/Applications Server and Oracle10g Forms and Reports.  The network infrastructure is both secure (firewall-protected) and sufficient to support all combined bandwidth requirements for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) communications between servers and with clients through Internet Service Providers (ISP), the Non-secure Internet Protocol Router NETwork (NIPRNET), and the Recruiting Service Network (RSN).  Programming languages include C/C++, Bourne/Korn shell, Structured Query Language (SQL), and HyperText Markup Language (HTML).  Auxiliary servers (for domain name service, configuration management, statistical analysis, geo-coding, etc.) are Intel 80x86-based systems with application-dependent amounts of memory and storage running Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition.

Stated software includes current and future versions. 

3.2.  	FUTURE OPERATING SYSTEM
The planned future operating environment will change from the current HP Tru64 UNIX / Oracle 9i RAC architecture to HP HP-UX 11i and Oracle 10g RAC.  Processors and storage area network capacity will double while the number of servers, server clusters, and amount of memory will remain the same.  Network connection speed will increase to 1Gbps and a centralized enterprise management and trouble alerting capability will be added.  Implementations will be staged through the end of FY09.  

4.0.	REQUIREMENTS GENERAL
The AFRS architecture supports all AFRS and ANG production recruiters and their support personnel (as required) worldwide.  A logical extension of support to the recruiting mission, AFRS software and hardware applications are designed to automate support throughout AFRS and ANG hierarchies to allow processing of data at the most logical locations to provide increased productivity and ensure the Air Force continues to access the highest quality people.  It will provide required interfaces with other Personnel Data Systems, US Military Entrance Processing Command (US MEPCOM) systems, Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) systems, Military Personnel Data System (MILPDS), and other systems.  AFRS provides management information systems to support HQ AFRS, ANG, and their respective subordinate units.  Source code and other configuration control assets are managed using MKS Integrity software.  Help desk calls and trouble tickets are managed using Helpdesk Electronic Automated Tool (HEAT) software.  Project management, task assignment, and time reporting are managed using Planview software.  In support of current and future AFRS architecture efforts, the contractor shall provide the following:

4.1.	SYSTEMS ACTIVITIES
The contractor shall provide technical expertise in the area of systems administration.  Systems activities consist of administering UNIX, Microsoft Windows Server systems hardware and software, HFNetchkPro Patch, Dameware Utilities, Hummingbird Exceed, SmartDraw, SSH Communications Security Tectia Server and Tectia Client, and MKS Toolkit for System Administrators.
