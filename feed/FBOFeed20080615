<DESC>The ongoing outbreak of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) among poultry and humans in Asia has raised concerns about its potential to cause a catastrophic influenza pandemic.  Over 150 million domestic poultry have died or been destroyed and 373 people have contracted the disease, of which 236 have died as of March 18, 2008. At present transmission is largely limited to animal-to-animal with occasional animal-to-human transmission.  There is growing concern, however, that if the virus evolves into an efficient human-to-human transmitter millions of lives may be threatened. An influenza pandemic would likely have a major effect on global economy, including travel, trade, tourism, consumption and eventually, investment and financial markets.  

In September 2005, faced with the growing threat of HPAI in Southeast Asia, USAID made avian and pandemic influenza a top priority for all missions and posts worldwide and asked missions to support implementation of an emergency containment plan in the shortest time possible.  Since that time, the U.S. Congress has pledged over $434 million to support HPAI prevention and control activities outside the United States.  In Asia, USAID has obligated approximately $114 million in funding since FY05.

An initial 14-month plan entitled “Containment of H5N1 AI: A USG Preparedness and Response Plan” was submitted to Congress in June 2005.  This plan, while generic in scope, focuses on containing the risk of HPAI infections through five inter-related objectives:

• Ensuring a coordinated international response. 
• Minimizing the risk of animal-to-human transmission. 
• Minimizing the risk of human-to-human transmission. 
• Ensure rapid & effective treatment and containment of the infected humans and animals. 
• Prepare against a pandemic. 

The USAID Regional Development Mission for Asia (RDMA), Bangkok, Office of Public Health (OPH) is responsible for implementing the AI program in Burma, China, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. RDMA/OPH staff also assists USAID staff in other missions in South and Southeast Asia to develop high-impact programs and act as a clearinghouse for sharing expertise and ideas.    

To ensure appropriate prevention and response to the HPAI threat in Vietnam USAID/Vietnam is recruiting a US PSC to assist in leading and managing the Vietnam AI portfolio.  This position is crucial to bringing strong coordination of AI programs and non HIV/AIDS infectious diseases among the USG agencies in Vietnam.  RDMA/OPH will continue to provide technical assistance and support to strengthening human resources capacity to coordinate the AI program in Vietnam and the region.   

BASIC FUNCTION OF POSITION

The AI Technical Advisor serves as the principal advisor to the USAID team in Vietnam managing all facets of non-HIV/AIDS infectious disease activities in Vietnam with a particular focus on AI.  The incumbent will be one of two Vietnam-based AI specialists supervised by the USDH Supervisory Health Officer in Vietnam.  In addition, this position will be supported by staff at the RDMA/OPH, Bangkok.  The incumbent will be required to be proactive in keeping abreast of evolving guidelines and policies which affect overall infectious disease and animal health activities within Vietnam. The incumbent will play a leadership role in coordinating and collaborating with other USG agencies in Vietnam in program planning, management and implementation, including the oversight of operational research projects. S/he will assist USAID/Vietnam and the RDMA with developing and assessing technical and strategic program approaches for preventing, detecting, and containing outbreaks of infectious disease with a particular focus on avian or pandemic influenza.  

To this end, the incumbent will play an important role in the following areas: program design, management and implementation; strategic information; Embassy and host country relations, networking and liaising with partners, donors, multilateral institutions, Ministries of Health and Agriculture and Rural Development, other GVN entities, foundations, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and community leaders.  The incumbent will be responsible for providing leadership, technical guidance, analysis, reporting and communications, and reporting on the performance of USAID-funded AI activities and other non-HIV/AIDS infectious disease activities in Vietnam, and identifying and resolving - in coordination with the CTOs of RDMA, Washington DC, and partners- any issues affecting overall program performance.  

S/he will be the primary planner and coordinator of AI activities and projects’ meetings, monitor AI programs through field visits and maintain appropriate documentation of AI and infectious disease activities in Vietnam.  The incumbent  will possess in-depth knowledge of infectious diseases, especially AI; be an innovative self-starter with technical, management and administrative skills;  be decisive, original, creative, imaginative and an effective communicator  to efficiently solve and handle complex and controversial problems or matters  which have little or no precedent, and usually require immediate attention.  The incumbent will demonstrate flexibility to ‘backstop’ activities outside of her/his stated job responsibilities as required.  S/he will also be prepared to coordinate when necessary Ambassadorial and State Department site visits and meetings and do the same for GVN Ministers and other top officials.

The incumbent will keep USAID appraised on the status of public health issues, with a particular focus on non HIV/AIDS infectious diseases including AI, new approaches and issues.
