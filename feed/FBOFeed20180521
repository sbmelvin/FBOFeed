<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a size standard of $38.5 Million average annual receipts. <br /><br /><br />AFRL/RIEBB, in support of the Battlefield Information, Collection &amp; Exploitation System (BICES), requires the purchase of Cross Domain Voice over Internet Protocol (CDVoIP) Software and Support. <br /><br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Trident Systems, Inc., 10201 Fairfax Boulevard Suite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030-2222. <br /><br /><br />The Government has determined that other companies' products do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet the Government's needs. <br /><br /><br />Cross Domain VoIP enables secure, confidential voice, face phone and point-to-point VTC communication and integrates with existing VoIP infrastructures to provide new cross-domain functionality to existing telephony systems. CDVoIP is the only VoIP Cross Domain solution on the UCDSMO (Unified Cross Domain Services Management Office) baseline.<br /><br /><br />Trident Systems Incorporated is the sole manufacturer of the CDVoIP Software. No other vendor offers a solution that provides this nature of software. CDVoIP by Trident Systems meets rigorous Department of Defense (DOD) and National Security Agency (NSA) standards allowing BICES to maintain a secure and resilient Cross Domain solution. The CDVoIP software is required to ensure consistency of the current configurations, security, continuity with already fielded software, and interoperability. It is critical that BICES obtains the specified CDVoIP software in order to properly replicate a fielded system for security testing. At this time, there is no qualified replacement that can fit into the customized environment that will not limit, diminish, or hinder the security testing effort. Therefore, a voice/visual Cross Domain system from a different vendor cannot be substituted. This software is currently deployed and movement to other software would require both applications to be operated in parallel to minimize the possibility of misconfigurations and would require an inordinate amount of man-hours to transition and install other software. <br /><br /><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action and NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Leslie.Christoferson@us.af.mil.

<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.</p>
<p>It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source<br />The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (One source) to Thermo Fisher Scientific for laboratory reagents and consumables. <br />Utilizing the Applied Biosystems* 7500 Fast Real-time PCR, MiSeq and MiniSeq platforms, reagents and compatible consumables are required to perform molecular diagnosis of Influenza virus, Adenovirus, Metapneumovirus, Enterovirus, Rhinovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Mayaro, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika virus. Specifically, this requirement involves using PCR enzymes for reverse transcription, Real-Time and Illumina platforms fused for the following:
<p>&bull; Detecting human influenza viruses (Influenza A-matrix gene and B) and its subtypes (H3, Hlpdrn/SwHlNl, Hl seasonal and H5) (Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) N6-VIR-MB RV 014).<br />&bull; Sequencing full genome of Influenza A using random amplification and pathogen discovery protocols in Illumina platform.<br />&bull; Detecting genetic material of Adenovirus in nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens (SOP N6-VIR-MB RV 007).<br />&bull; Detecting the genetic material of Metapneumovirus (MPV), Enterovirus, Rhinovirus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in nasal and pharyngeal swabs specimens using a reverse transcription (SOP N6-VIR-MB RV 006). <br />&bull; Amplification of the whole genome of the Influenza A virus based on the amplification of full-length gene segments for SNP genotyping, gene expression analysis, and genotype (SOP N6-VIR-MB RV 001).<br />&bull; Pathogen discovery in respiratory and serum samples collected in our surveillance protocols.</p>
<p>NAMRU-6 owns and uses the Applied Biosystems* 7500 Fast Real-time PCR, MiSeq and MiniSeq platforms, where the supplies have been validated, and therefore, compatibility of the consumables is a requirement. Design and validation of NAMRU-6 laboratory procedures have been standardized with these items, since they have shown to perform up to NAMRU-6's research standards. Assays have been developed independently for each SOP followed in the laboratories; therefore, the reagents must remain the same as the ones specified in the SOPs, otherwise, the design and validation of these processes would have to be reinitiated from zero, which would delay all processing and the timely diagnosis of public health relevant pathogens. Changing the source of reagents would mean altering the validity of the results for the surveillance studies that measure rates of disease across years.</p>
<p>While the majority of the items are available through Thermo Fisher Scientific only; some items are available from other sources; however, the only vendor that can provide all items together is the proposed source. Items must arrive at NAMRU-6 in Lima, Peru in accordance with a defined schedule in order to sustain the laboratory activities to meet the mission of NAMRU-6. The only way to assure that the items will arrive as required is by purchasing from one vendor. Peruvian customs clearance usually takes between 3-4 weeks, and having multiple shipments from multiple orders pending in customs could lead to some reagents being unavailable when needed for conducting for testing, this would be detrimental to mission-critical processes and ultimately lead to a delay in reporting research results and findings to our funders.</p>
<p>*Applied Biosystems merged with Life Technologies that was later acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific in 2014.<br />If capable sources are not identified through this notice, NMLC intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Thermo Fisher Scientific, 28 Schenck Pkwy, Suite 400, Asheville, NC, 28805-5053.</p>
<p>This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work. Capability statements shall not exceed 1 (8.5 x 11 inch) page using a font size no smaller than 10-point. All capability statements received by the due date of this notice will be considered by the Government. A request for documentation or additional information will not be considered as an affirmative response.

All offerors MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). All responsible sources may submit offers which, if received in timely fashion, shall be considered.<br />DLA Troop Support has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles solicitations, use the following link to the DLA Troop Support C&amp;T Technical Data Repository area at: http://www.dla.mil/TroopSupport/ClothingandTextiles/SpecRequest.aspx <br />Important Note on Foreign Content: <br />The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as "The Berry Amendment" impose restrictions on the DoD's acquisition of foreign products and services. Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014) must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.<br />-------- IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT --------<br />Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate. There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate). VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2103. After that date, no one may log on using the old user ID and password.<br />DoDI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DoD PKI identity certificates when accessing DoD information systems. The DoD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DoD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DoD and authenticate themselves to DoD Information Systems. ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DoD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DoD Information Systems.<br />The following are the three entities authorized by the DoD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br />1. IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/eca/index.html<br />2. ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br />3. VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/<br />There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can get the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to their hard drive. If one person logs on from different computers they should get the Medium Token Assurance which can be carried around like a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate. Each user will need their own (like our CAC card). Each person who needs to access the system will need one.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Availability of solicitations: FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. <br />Interested offerors can obtain a copy of the solicitation after the issuance date at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. Detailed system requirements and instructions for registration can be found on the DLA DIBBS home page accessed on https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. A few highlights of the information that will be found include: 1. On the DLA Internet Bulletin Board System (DIBBS) home page, click the VENDOR REGISTRATION link to begin the registration process. 2. In order to register for access to secure portions of DLA DIBBS, the company you are representing must already be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. 3. A Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code registration will be processed immediately. A User ID will appear on the registration screen and a password will be sent separately to the email address of the Super User. If a CAGE is already registered on DLA DIBBS, the name and email address of the Super User will be provided. The Super User should be contacted to set-up additional accounts, logons and passwords for their CAGE.
