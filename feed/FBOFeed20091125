<DESC>The USAF Electronic Systems Center's (ESC) XR functional (referred to further herein as XR) has responsibility for capability integration at ESC, encompassing capability planning, developmental planning, and technology planning for ESC's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems.  It is intended that programs under this BAA include research and technology based theories in a broad range of technical areas that support C4ISR and network-centric operations to enable a competitive warfighting advantage.
The R&D conducted under this BAA should explore unique and innovative approaches to technologies supporting C4ISR allowing for integration into service-oriented architectures which are needed to transform Air Force operations towards net-centric capabilities.  Technology projects may include empirical research, prototypes, test beds, and proof of concept demonstrations.  
Projects should provide insight to ESC/XR personnel to understand the maturity of technological innovations, prepare for concepts to enter the developmental planning process, support network-centric experimentation venues, and produce technology roadmaps in support of existing Joint and Air Force programs of record.  Results should be capable of productization.  Joint and Coalition use are encouraged. Proposals that involve interdisciplinary teams are especially encouraged.

The objective is to extend theperformance period for five months. This extension will allow the necessary time to complete ongoing efforts associated withcompetitive follow-on procurement NNA09281196R, allowing for continuation of services toensure program continuity and critical mission support and avoid significant logisticservice impacts. The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services for theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center and MoffettField (MF) locations.  ARC and MF include on-site and off-site Government and  contracttenant organizations, as well as  three areas of military housing (inside MF; outside theMF Main Gate, west of the Moffett Boulevard extension; and on Moffett Boulevard, west ofUS Highway 101).

<p>This Synopsis is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotation (RFQ). The attached Draft Statement of Work may be subject to change and is provided for informational purposes only.</p>
<p>The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) established Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) as a federal corporation to encourage the growth of defined benefit pension plans, provide timely and uninterrupted payment of pension benefits, and keep pension insurance premiums at a minimum. Defined benefit pension plans promise to pay a specified monthly benefit at retirement, commonly based on salary and years on the job. PBGC, a wholly owned United States Government corporation, administers the insurance program and termination process for most private-sector defined benefit pension plans that are tax-qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. PBGC is headed by a Director who reports to a board of directors consisting of the Secretaries of Labor, Commerce, and Treasury, with the Secretary of Labor as Chairman. General tax revenues do not fund PBGC. PBGC collects insurance premiums from employers that sponsor insured pension plans, earns money from investments and receives the assets of the pension plans it terminates.<br />The Investment Manager (hereinafter referred to as contractor) shall provide active investment management services for fixed income portfolios that will provide over a full market cycle, a total rate of return which exceeds the benchmark of the respective portfolio, consistent with appropriate levels of risk.<br />Investments of trust fund assets for this mandate may include fixed income and derivative products that are obligations of both domestic (U.S.) and non-U.S. issuers. The contractor shall exercise best efforts to select securities suitable and appropriate to the PBGC's mission. The contractor shall be responsible for providing active investment management and related services for fixed income portfolios. The portfolios may be in one or more of the five fixed income strategies listed below:<br />Strategies:<br />1. Core Fixed Income<br />2. Global Fixed Income<br />3. Long duration Fixed Income<br />4. Emerging Markets Debt<br />5. High Yield</p>

The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541310 Architectural Services. The Construction Range for the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  This acquisition is Full and Open is accordance with the Brooks Act.Scope of Work: The A/E design shall include, but shall not be limited to, designing a 14,920 gsf addition to the south end of Building 1 on top of the building addition to be designed under Fargo VA Medical Center project 437-310 for what used to be known as the Transitional Care Unit (TCU), but is now known as the Community Living Center (CLC).  Approximately 14,033 gsf of existing space shall be remodeled so the CLC may be provided with private patient rooms and a more home like setting.  The existing CLC areas would be completely gutted and remodeled.  Presently patients typically share a room with another patient and a toilet room with three other patients.  There is no shower in the shared toilet rooms located between the bedrooms.  Showers must be taken in one of the single shower rooms at each end of the existing TCU space.  The remodel would include providing private rooms with attached bathrooms that include showers.  The design and finishes would provide more of a home-like setting for the patients.  The new addition would be designed to blend seamlessly with the existing construction and remodeling of existing space.All utilities (electrical, HVAC, plumbing, sprinklers, fire alarm, etc) serving the existing CLC space would be replaced since the area would be gutted and remodeled.  The addition space would be provided with all new utilities.  The existing chiller plant sizing would be evaluated to determine if an additional chiller would be required, but it is believed that there is sufficient existing capacity.  If a new chiller is required, there is space and a connection point within the existing chiller plant location for one additional chiller to be installed.  The windows in the existing space would be reused since they are only a few years old and are energy efficient.  Windows within the addition would be required to match the existing windows.  The exterior construction of the new addition would be brick to match and blend with the adjacent buildings.SELECTION CRITERIA: The VA will utilize the following selection criteria: (1) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm (including a joint venture or association) with the type of services required. (2) Specific experience and professional qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and record of working together. (3) Professional capacity of the firm in the geographic area of the project to perform work (including any specialized services) within the time limitations. (Usually large existing workload that may limit A/Es capacity to perform project work expeditiously). (4) Past record of performance on contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs or other government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. (5) Demonstrate success in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the NASA Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS)which enables scientists to increase their understanding of the Earth, the solar system,and the universe by supplying state-of-the-art high performance computing, storage,network, and application solutions. To accomplish this mission, the NCCS provideslarge-scale compute engines, analytics, data sharing, long-term storage, networking, andother very high-end computing services designed to meet the specialized needs of theEarth and space science communities.NASA researchers in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and the GlobalModeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) will be using the NCCS computational systems forclimate simulations as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)assessment of climate change. The resultant datasets will be made available to theworldwide climate research community using a distributed data portal known as the EarthSystem Grid (ESG) developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratorys (LLNL) Programfor Climate Model Diagnostics and Intercomparison (PCMDI). The ESG consists of twocomponents or nodes, the Gateway node and Data nodes. The Gateway Node, at LLNL, willprovide the entry point to all IPCC data for users. Data Nodes will be located at many ofthe computing centers and will contain the data as well as analysis tools to assistscientists access the data they desire, including the new Data node that we are buildingat GSFC. The Data Nodes will be connected to the Gateway Node thru the Internet. Climate Scientists will use the NASA data, as well as data generated by approximatelytwenty computing centers, in performing their scientific research. The entirety of thisresearch will be collected, reviewed and analyzed by the IPPC and they will publish anoverview report titled The Fifth Assessment Report Climate 2013 which is referred to asAssessment Report No. 5 (AR5).This task, using ARRA funds will install, integrate, test and manage the ESG Data Nodesoftware as provided by PCMDI at the NCCS at GSFC. The project will also publish GISS andGMAO IPCC AR5 datasets through the ESG as they become available. NASA/GSFC intends to award a new Task 23 under Contract No. NNG06HX04C with ScienceApplications International Corporation (SAIC).	Cost plus award fee Contract No.NNG06HX04C was awarded to SAIC, on December 28, 2005, on a competitive basis.This notice is provided for informational purposes only, in accordance with the AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

These arrays are the only arrays that can be used in the Affymetrix GeneChip system (consisting of hybridization oven, fluidics station, and laser scanner).  The Hybe, Wash, and Stain Kit is the only kit that provides the high quality reagents needed to generate high quality data with Affymetrix microarrays.  Affymetrixs photolithogrphic manufacturing technology enables consistent production of probe array designs and reduces variation inherent in less sophisticated array manufacturing technologies. These arrays are to be used on existing Affymetrix Eukaryotic GeneChip system for an ongoing research project.  Ordering from another source would compromise on-going experiments and compromise the integrity of data.Any firm believing itself capable of providing these services may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 10 days of date of notice to Tanya Shields at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 10 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Affymetrix INC.  The NAICS Code/Size is 325414/500.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold of $100,000.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Tanya Shields via email shields3@niehs.nih.gov.*****

To be further evaluated, firms must submit information in response to the criteria established in this RFQ by the specified due date and time.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 236220, and the U.S. Small Business Administration Size Standard is $31.0 million.  This project is available to all responsible Design-Build contractors nationwide meeting the above-referenced NAICS code and size standard under full and open competition.
The Scope of Work (SOW) includes design and construction of the Crow Creek Tribal School Replacement Project, CRCR-156772.  The project includes a new school building for K-12 students; a new dormitory building for Grades 7-12 students; a new building for a combined bus garage and facilities maintenance shop; employee quarters [Five (5) quarters units in Four (4) buildings: One (1) building containing a three (3)-bedroom quarters unit, Two (2) buildings containing two (2)-bedroom quarters units, and One (1) townhouse building containing two (2) one (1)-bedroom quarters units]; a football field and running track with bleachers; sewage lagoon expansion; and other related site development and utilities (both on- and off-campus); and a north access road to Highway 34.  Portions of the project are intended to meet current LEED Silver certification standards.
The work may include structural enhancements to meet the requirements of a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-compliant Tornado/Storm Shelter area.
The contractor's design will be based upon the Schematic Design (SD) drawings, project requirements narrative, and Performance Technical Specifications (PTS) that will be provided in a subsequent Request for Proposal (Phase Two).  Contractor recommendations for creative cost savings and/or quality-enhancing design solutions will be considered via the later RFP/Phase Two process.  The project process will follow National Park Service (NPS) workflows (http://www.nps.gov/dsc/workflows/designbuild.htm ).
The estimated price is between $33,000,000 and $38,000,000, including all design and construction services.  The contract provides for preparation of Design Development (DD) and Construction Documents (CDs).  ARRA funding has been secured for this project.
It is anticipated that the project will follow "Fast-Track construction" processes to meet schedule goals.  Record (redlined) hard copy drawings and As-Constructed AutoCAD files drawings will also be required upon construction completion.
All Design-Build (D-B) firms have until 4:00 P.M. (Mountain Time Zone), January 30, 2010, to provide qualifications for evaluation based upon the following criteria in descending order of importance:

1. Past performance, demonstrating quality of work, professional expertise, technical competence, and ability to effectively schedule and manage a multi-disciplinary work force; 
2. Extent of design/build experience, especially experience that the offeror's current A-E/construction company partnership has working together.  Include any examples that utilize the "fast-track construction" process that demonstrates proven performance in meeting project schedules.  Include any examples that demonstrate proven performance in administration of and/or construction of buildings with LEED Certification for New Construction; 
3. Demonstrated ability to provide innovative, cost effective design and construction solutions, with emphasis and a commitment to improving on the initial design concepts without adding to the overall project cost; 
4. Experience with projects of a type and scope similar to that of this project, which include implementation of BIA requirements and successful implementation of a Tribal Employment Rights Office (TERO) Compliance Plan.
Design-Build (D-B) firms/teams that meet the requirements of this announcement are invited to submit a Standard Form (SF) 330, U.S. Government Architect-Engineer Qualifications, to the office indicated above for Phase One evaluation.  The SF 330's are formatted for Architect-Engineer (A-E) and related services, but this form will be used for both design and construction qualifications.  The SF 330 can be downloaded from the forms library section at following website:  http://www.gsa.gov.
Only hard copy responses received by 4:00 P.M. (Mountain Time Zone), January 7, 2010, will be evaluated further.  Up to Five (5) of the most highly-qualified Design-Build (D-B) firms will be short-listed to participate in Phase Two of this Design-Build selection process.
In Phase Two, those firms short-listed will be sent the Request for Proposal (RFP) which will contain the NPS Schematic Design Drawings, project requirements narrative, Performance Technical Specifications (PTS), and evaluation criteria for technical and firm-fixed price proposals.  Offerors will be asked to prepare a proposal that may include design enhancements/cost-savings measures, and a project management plan describing the contractor's management philosophy, proposed schedule, team organization, and quality control as part of the Phase Two technical proposal.

In addition, the Government must completely control the hosting environment, software licenses, support contracts service levels, content, experiences, and user access.&nbsp; The Government envisions a fully immersive, persistent 3D experience using avatars as the user interface rather than more traditional 2D web based experiences. The VW infrastructure, core components, and tools must provide a complete platform to support collaboration.&nbsp; The Government envisions a solution that is extensible where specialized functionality shall be provided through the use of plug-ins developed by other Government programs and/or commercial entities that interface to the VW through open Application Programmer's Interfaces (API) and non-proprietary data formats that provide access to the internal VW data model.&nbsp; An open architecture solution is required to provide the level of interoperability and extensibility that will be necessary for the wide variety of use cases anticipated.&nbsp; <a name="_Toc490362905"></a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park Radiation Safety Committee, has a one-time requirement for disposal of low-level Nuclear Wastes from the temporary storage facility in Menlo Park, CA.
The Contractor shall coordinate and manage the safe transfer of radioactive wastes from the temporary storage facility to an authorized disposal site.
In November 2005, USGS awarded a noncompetitive four year delivery order to New World Technologies, Inc. under their GSA Schedule for services to manage the Radiation Safety Program in Menlo Park, CA.  The services included, in part, managing receipt of radioactive wastes from Permit Holder laboratories and administering the transfer to the waste storage facility at the USGS waste storage quarterly.  The present requirement for the disposal of low-level Nuclear Wastes is considered a follow-on to that award.  
New World Technology, Inc., Livermore, CA is, to the USGS' knowledge, the only interested and qualified contractor because they oversee the overall program including managing receipt of radioactive wastes from Permit Holder laboratories and administer the transfer to the waste storage facility.  Therfore, they are intimately aware of the types of waste produced from the labs and have a high degree of familiarity with the types of waste and their final packaging.  As such, the government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) to New World Technology for the services.  Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS' requirement may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 16:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  If no competitive opportunities exist, a request for quotation will be made available to New World Technology on or about 04 Dec 2009. 
This notice and any resulting quotation or purchase order conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-37, effective 13 Nov 2009.  NAICS 562910 - Remediation Services, for which the associated size standard is $14 million.

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to develop a conceptual design that analyzes and defines requirements for a gas-to-market system in Cameroon.</p>
<p>BRIEF PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF GRANTEE</p>
<p>Cameroon possesses significant natural gas reserves, but it currently is not utilizing them. Rather, almost 90% of the gas in the current offshore oilfield is being flared. Not only is this environmentally undesirable, it wastes the opportunity to commercialize an indigenous energy resource and use it to replace biomass and fuel oil as energy sources. The gas to market system, when implemented, will consist of an offshore gathering pipeline system, gas processing plants and an industrial pipeline distribution system. USTDA's assistance will provide Cameroon's Ministry of Energy and Water Resources ( Minist&egrave;re de l'Energie et de l'Eau) or MINEE with a solid foundation for putting this project out for tender and help MINEE evaluate this system in the comparison to other concepts for commercializing the country's gas reserves.</p>

Therefore, respondents should provide a statement of capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience necessary to successfully compete for this award. Large businesses are also encouraged to submit e-mails to the Contract Specialist stated below of intent should this effort not be selected as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>To be considered capable, interested parties must demonstrate an excellent knowledge of: (1) the targeting cycle; (2) how the Joint Targeting Toolbox (JTT) and the Joint Targeting Database (JTDB) support the targeting cycle and processes; (3) the DoDIIS and intelligence worlds, how these affect JTT and JTDB in terms of the systems JTT and JTDB interface with, and which data are passed back and forth; (4) the environments in which JTT and JTDB are fielded, in particular GCCS and MIDB; (5) which services are available via JTT and JTDB, and (6) the JTT and JTDB software, including which operating systems they reside on, and how all the internal pieces work together.

<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Lori L. Anguilli, (315) 330-1955, Lori.Anguilli@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Susan Hunter, Building 15, RM225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 FAX: 937-255-5036 COM: 937-255-7754. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the AFRL level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force Ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contract Specialist.</p>
<p>NOTE: Due to limitations of the FedBizOpps website, the Government is unable to post both the Sources Sought and Pre-Solicitation Notices using the same Solicitation Number. Therefore, the Government is posting the Sources Sought Notice at Solicitation Number "E01259_ITAC", which will contain only the Sources Sought Notice and all modifications thereto. The Pre-Solicitation Notice, Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP), if applicable, Request for Proposal and any additional updates will be posted to a Solicitation Number to be determined at a later date. All prospective offerors are instructed to continue to routinely monitor and register under Solicitation Number E01259_ITAC. At the time of the posting of the Pre-solicitation Notice, this Sources Sought Notice will be modified to identify the Pre-Solicitation number.</p>

<p>A brief functional overview is provided in an attachment to this notice. It is likely that there will be revisions to the functional responsibilities prior to any solicitation for this requirement.</p>
<p>Note that this Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only. The applicable NAICS code is 561210 with an associated small business size standard of $35,500,000 average annual revenue.</p>
<p>The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used to develop an acquisition strategy and future solicitation. The Air Force is considering whether to set aside this Firm Fixed Price (FFP) acquisition for competitive 8(a), HUBZone SB, Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB, or SB concerns. If adequate responses are not received, the acquisition may be solicited on a "full and open" basis.</p>
<p>If this effort is to be set aside, then a clause such as FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply and at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel will have to be expended for employees of the prime contractor.</p>
<p>All interested 8(a), HUBZone SB, SDVOSB, and SB concerns are invited to respond. In order to be considered, responses must be organized as follows:</p>
<p>1. Positive statement of intent to submit a proposal for this solicitation as a prime contractor. Include a description of how the 50% requirement would be met. Describe how anticipated subcontractors, if any, would be selected and which functional areas they would be responsible for.</p>
<p>2. Evidence of successful performance within the past three (3) years of no more than five (5) contract efforts similar in magnitude and scope to the work described in this notice. Include information such as Statements of Work and description of facilities support tasks, as well as contract amounts, performance periods, and points of contact.</p>
<p>3. Demonstration of access to organizational resources, especially qualified and experienced personnel, needed for this type of work. This may include resources either within the prime contractor's organization or available through a subcontracting relationship. Ensure it is clearly stated whether the resources would be available from the prime or subcontractor. If subcontracting is contemplated, indicate whether the prime and subcontractor have successfully fulfilled similar efforts together in the past.</p>
<p>4. Description of prime contractor's Program Management and Quality Control methodologies. This should be general and not exceed two (2) pages in length.</p>
<p>5. Description of how any significant geographic separation between the prime contractor's primary office and AFRL Rome Research Site would be successfully overcome. Please address the feasibility of a limited on-site presence, such as a contractor Program Manager.</p>
<p>6. Documentation of current 8(a), HUBZone SB, SDVOSB, or SB status such as SBA certification letter or other evidence. (For more information on the definition or requirements, refer to http://www.sba.gov)</p>
<p><br />All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on the availability of interested 8(a), HUBZone SB, SDVOSB, and SB concerns. Failure to submit all information requested will result in a contractor being considered &lsquo;NOT INTERESTED' in this requirement.</p>
<p>Firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit their responses to the attention of Jenna Loreto, Contracting Officer (jenna.loreto@rl.af.mil) with an email copy to Janis Norelli, Small Business Specialist (janis.norelli@rl.af.mil). Responses must be sent by email.</p>
<p>All information must be received before 3:00 PM ET FRI 11 DEC 2009 to be considered.</p>

This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Any information provided to the Government as a result of this Sources Sought Notice is voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or the Government's use of such information.</p>

It is desired to achieve this goal without compromising the ballistic performance to ensure optimal operational effectiveness.  This should be achieved via effective usage of 1) Develop Flux Compression Generator (FCG) Design, Modelling and Simulation (M&S) and Engineering designs Static and Dynamic loads).  The contractor will design the FCGs components for testing with both a static and dynamic load(s).  2)  Investigate and develop Dual Liners: Shaped Charge Liner Design and Modeling.  The contractor will examine various parameters to provide maximum penetration into a variety of targets using computational tools to parametrically design the liner and to calculate penetration as a function of liner characteristics and jet properties.  The process for MAHEM should be scaleable from 40 mm to 155 mm munitions, and possibly larger calibers, to address multiple service requirements and applications.  Demonstrated prior experience/capability(ies) are required.  The contractor must have an understanding and working knowledge of FCGs and integrating into various loads.  In addition, the contractor must be fluent in the following hydrodynamic codes, to include:  CTH, CALE, ALEGRA as well as the electro-materials code COMSOL.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION


The purpose of this performance based contract is to meet the temporary staffing needs of the Idaho Montana Acqusistion Team wich includes the Coeur dAlene , Clearwater, Nez Perce and Kootemai National Forests.

The contractor shall provide a Certificate of Insurance stating their limits of liability and bonding provisions.  (See FAR clause 52.212-4 Addendum for the full text of FAR 52.228-5 Insurance-Work on a Government Installation.) 

The Contractor shall provide the best qualified worker for each position requested and all other services necessary for furnishing workers to the point of hire.

<CONTACT>Amy Brayshaw, abrayshaw@nctrf.natick.army.mil,508-233-4189, x214
<DESC>Background:  The Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility (NCTRF) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of cost-effective flame resistant (FR) materials for use in military clothing and equipment.  Objectives of this research are to:.Provide flame resistant protection to a broader community.Provide cost effective alternative FR materials for mass use.Offer multiple fabric alternatives to support the supply chain After review and initial physical test evaluation of industry submissions, the most promising fabrics may be down selected and subjected to additional physical property testing.  Successful candidate fabrics could be used in future uniform procurements.  
Description: NCTRF seeks to identify cost-effective flame resistant materials that are either 1) significantly less expensive than traditional FR materials or 2) affordable for use in uniforms that are not currently FR protective.  Already commercialized materials, as well as experimental materials utilizing advanced topical finishes and/or inherently protective fiber compilations and/or fabric substrates including woven, knitted, and nonwoven materials, will be considered for evaluation.  
Flame Resistant Requirements: Materials submitted shall meet, at a minimum, FR requirements when tested in accordance with ASTM D6413 - Standard Test Method for Flame Resistance of Textiles (Vertical Test). All submissions must have a maximum after flame of two seconds and a maximum char length of four and one half inches, and shall not melt or drip when tested in accordance with ASTM D6413 before and after 50 launderings (permanent press cycle, 1405F, tumble dry permanent press (according to AATCC 135, Table I (3) V A (iii)).  Submissions will not be considered if they do not meet the vertical flame requirements.  
Cost Requirements: Materials shall also meet a maximum threshold cost per linear yard.  The target threshold (required) price per linear yard for woven materials is $15.00 ($10.00 objective (desired)) (based on 60 inch width).  The target threshold price per linear yard for knitted or nonwoven materials is $10.00 ($5.00 objective) (based on 60 inch open width).  Submissions will not be considered if they do not meet the maximum threshold cost per linear yard requirement.
Candidates:To respond to this Sources Sought Notice, interested candidates are REQUIRED to submit the following for their submission to enable the Government to efficiently evaluate the viability and benefit of the proposed material(s):
1.A material description, identification of fiber blend (including fiber percentages), complete disclosure of chemical treatment if using topical finish, applicable Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and documentation for Berry compliance.  2.Vertical flame test results (IAW ASTM D6413) must be provided for each submission.  Test results must include before and after 50 launderings.  Any additional physical property test data may be submitted but is not required.  
3.An estimated unit cost per linear yard (specify width of material), which may be broken down by quantity reflecting economies of scale.  
4.A minimum of 5 yards in any color or print available and written assurance that the material can either be produced in a solid color (e.g. Navy blue 3388) or in the Navy Digital Print1/.  
5.Information which certifies that the finished product is composed of materials which have been safely used commercially or provide sufficient toxicity data to show compatibility with prolonged, direct skin contact.  The finished cloth shall not present a dermal health hazard when used as intended.  
Submissions are limited to five (5) materials per candidate2/.  Initial fabric samples and required documentation submitted by interested candidates are due by COB 8 January 2010 at NCTRF.  Information will be handled as proprietary and samples will not be returned.

<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center Development Planning, SMC/XR, located at Los Angeles Air Force Base, CA is conducting a CSM demo in FY12. In conjunction with the demo, SMC/XR is conducting market research and assessing industry capabilities and interest in supporting CSM mission planning exercises and tool development. The project will have a budget of roughly $10M with a period of performance from FY10 through FY12. <br /><br />The vision of the exercises is to develop and execute a series of scenarios using operationally relevant information to refine CSM mission planning operational requirements. The scenarios will contain all parameters to simulate geography, target, threat and treaties in the theaters of choice. The exercises will simulate and/or use, when permitted, the US STRATCOM strategic planning process and command structure. The exercises will be developed iteratively starting with a table top exercise. Notionally, the final exercise will be conducted along with the CSM demo flight and will include strategic planning and launch operations personnel and use the current mission planning tools.
<p><br />The vision for the Mission Planning Tool Suite (MPTS) is to design and test a modular prototype. This prototype should contain a weaponeering module, flight planning module and interface module to Integrated Strategic Planning Analysis (ISPAN) and to command and control (C2). Furthermore, the prototype should produce a Course of Action (COA) and Operational Order (OpOrd) and a data standard should be developed based on the joint planning process used by US STRATCOM.

In conjunction with the demo, SMC/XR is conducting market research and assessing industry capabilities and interest in supporting CSM mission planning exercises and tool development. The project will have a budget of roughly $10M with a period of performance from FY10 through FY12.</p>
<p>The vision of the exercises is to develop and execute a series of scenarios using operationally relevant information to refine CSM mission planning operational requirements. The scenarios will contain all parameters to simulate geography, target, threat and treaties in the theaters of choice. The exercises will simulate and/or use, when permitted, the US STRATCOM strategic planning process and command structure. The exercises will be developed iteratively starting with a table top exercise. Notionally, the final exercise will be conducted along with the CSM demo flight and will include strategic planning and launch operations personnel and use the current mission planning tools.</p>
<p>The vision for the Mission Planning Tool Suite (MPTS) is to design and test a modular prototype. This prototype should contain a weaponeering module, flight planning module and interface module to Integrated Strategic Planning Analysis (ISPAN) and to command and control (C2). Furthermore, the prototype should produce a Course of Action (COA) and Operational Order (OpOrd) and a data standard should be developed based on the joint planning process used by US STRATCOM. The CSM FY12 Demo mission planning effort will integrate information from other program segments such as the launch and weapon segments.</p>

The ASBCA, in that decision, found that Derm/Buro was entitled to excusable delay for those contracts as a result of deficiencies in the Anti-G suit specification that governed those contracts. Upon receipt of that decision, DSCP took the ASBCA's findings into account with respect to the previous terminations under Contract SPO100-04-D-4031. Accordingly, DSCP converted the July 31, 2007 termination for default of Lot 7, the May 31, 2007 termination for default of Lots 8 and 9, and the August 6, 2007 termination for default of the undelivered balance on the contract to terminations for convenience.</p>

<SUBJECT>Special Notice for Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Development and Sustainment Contract
<SOLNBR>HQ0147-10-R-0016
<CONTACT>Michele D. Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone 256-450-1427, Email michele.williams@mda.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to pursue a competitive Development and Sustainment Contract  (DSC) for future development; fielding; test; systems engineering, integration and configuration management; equipment manufacturing and refurbishment; training; and operations and sustainment support for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system and associated support facilities.  Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.205(c), this is a special notice that the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to pursue a competitive strategy for the effort described above. This effort was previously announced as RFP #HQ0147-09-R-0007.  The potential scope described in the previous announcement has been revised to include significant requirements beyond GMD operations and logistics support, and the RFP number has been changed to HQ0147-10-R-0016.   The Draft Statement of Objectives is attached.  

Ground Based Mid-Course Defense (GMD) System and associated facilities are located at Schriever Air Force Base (AFB), Colorado, Fort Greely, Alaska, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.  The principal locations of GMD program performance include the facilities at the above locations as well as MDA and contractor operated facilities located at Huntsville, Alabama.  The GMD Weapon System/element is a complex system of systems that consists of hardware and software, including Ground Based Interceptors (GBIs), GBI Fire Control Nodes, GBI silos, and related flight and ground test equipment; Launch Site Components, Command Launch Equipment, and related Peculiar Support Equipment; the In-Flight Interceptor Communications System (IFICS) Data Terminal (IDT); training equipment and tactical/non-tactical communications equipment and support facilities.  The acquisition is expected to have an approximate annual value of $600 million.  

The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors, i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor and/or participate as a subcontractor on one or more other proposing teams. Further, the government does not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award, except as may be necessary to prevent organizational conflicts of interest between this requirement and advisory and assistance contracts in support of the GMD Joint Program Office.  

In order to be considered for award, all contractor personnel must possess and maintain at least a SECRET security clearance and proposed contractor facilities must be cleared at the TOP SECRET level.  Due to national security considerations, this acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level. 

This special notice is for informational purposes only and is NOT a solicitation of information, request for proposals (RFP), or a commitment by the Government that this DCS contract will definitely be awarded.  The Government will not pay for any costs incurred as a result of this notice.  A draft RFP is expected to be released  early 2nd Quarter, Fiscal Year (FY) 10.  An Industry Day is planned for late 2nd Quarter, FY 10.  The final RFP is expected to be released during the  3rd Quarter, FY10.   Proposal evaluation and discussions are expected to take place during 4th Quarter, FY 10 and 1st Quarter FY 11, with contract award and debriefings expected during 2nd Quarter, FY 11.

A bidders library is available for industry review and comment. The government plans to add technical data and other information to the bidders library as they become available throughout the pre-solicitation phase.  The bidders library contains classified and export-controlled data, therefore, access will be restricted to personnel who have been pre-cleared by MDA contracting and security officials. The procedure for receipt and review of requests for library access is to obtain and sign a GMD Bidders Library Access Agreement.  This form may be obtained by contacting Ms. Tracie Gutierrez, Contract Specialist, at tracie.gutierrez@mda.mil.  The bidders library is available at https://dcp.mda.mil/MDDCCatalog/index.aspx.  

It has been determined that the solicitation for the DSC will contain Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) provision which will read substantially as follows:  

NOTICE REGARDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI) AGREEMENT(S) (FAR 9.5):
 
a.  Responsibility lies with the prime contract offerors to ensure that both they and their proposed subcontractors are not restricted from participating in this proposed acquisition due to an OCI clause in any Federal Government Contract, including, but not limited to, Missile Defense Agency (MDA) contracts.

b. Any offeror who has signed, as well as all proposed subcontractors who have signed, a contract with an OCI agreement as either a prime contractor or subcontractor under any such contract shall submit a written application to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Directorate of Contracting, Ground Based Midcourse Defense, via email to tracie.gutierrez@mda.mil, to obtain approval to participate in this acquisition. 

c.  Further, if either the prime (or any of its proposed subcontractors) is currently performing (or in process of proposing on) an effort that appears to have a potential conflict with the upcoming GMD DSC role, regardless of whether there is an OCI clause or not, the prospective prime contractor shall submit a written application to the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Directorate of Contracting, Ground Based Midcourse Defense, via email to tracie.gutierrez@mda.mil, to obtain approval to participate in this acquisition. 

d.  The offeror(s) with either of the potential OCI restrictions, described in paragraphs b. or c. above, shall provide electronically (either via email or on a floppy disk/zip disk/CD in MS Word or Acrobat .pdf Format):  (i) the prime contract or subcontract OCI clause; (ii) a copy of each contract Scope of Work (SOW); (iii) a copy of each task order (TO), technical directive (TD), or task assignment (TA) performed or being performed by the offeror; and (iv) the government technical point of contact (including his/her current email address, office symbol, and telephone number) for each contract SOW, T/O, TD and/or TA submitted for review.  Each file on the email/disk shall be identified by Contract Number, followed by TO, TD, and/or TA number if applicable.  The email/disk shall also include a file entitled, Table of Contents, which shall include all contracts, TOs, TDs, and TAs with the name, current email address, office symbol, and telephone number of the government technical point of contact.

The anticipated period of performance (PoP) for this acquisition is 5 to 10 years.  

Evaluation factors will be based on past performance, technical, management, and cost/price.  Past performance will be considered a significant evaluation factor in the overall evaluation process.  

The point of contact for this effort is Michele Williams, Contracting Officer at:  michele.williams@mda.mil. All communication/inquiries with the Government regarding this DSC acquisition shall be made directly to the Contracting Office at:  GMDD&SCompetition@mda.mil.  Periodically, all publicly available information will be posted to the MDA Business Acquisition Reporting Bulletin Board at: http://www.mda.mil/barbb/barbb.htm.

<DESC>The Virginia Army National Guard (VaARNG)intends to award a sole source purchase order to the Marriott, 1901 MeadowView Parkway, Kingsport, TN for lodging(150 rooms per night), general session conference space for up to 500 attendees, seven (7) breakout areas and catering services for 500 attendees during the period December 11-12, 2009.  The requirement is the result of a Yellow Ribbon event for the 1032nd headquartered in Gate City, VA.  Based on market research, there were no additional facilities identified within a twenty (20) mile radius which can accommodate an event of this magnitude.  A geographical limitation of twenty miles was considered as overall travel costs and the number of family members who will attend is negatively impacted as the mileage from home station increases.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  Information shall be submitted by 5:30 p.m. ET, Monday, November 30, 2009.  Submit to Rebecca Fowler via email, rebecca.fowler@us.army.mil, or fax, 434-298-6202.<BR>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) <strong>o Are, o are not</strong> presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) <strong>o Have, o have not</strong>, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3)<strong> o Are, o are not</strong> presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) <strong>o Have, o have not</strong>, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

8. Basis for Brand Name Requirement:
This procurement is in support of DCPS which is migrating from TSO-PE to TSO-IN.  In order to meet the timelines imposed by a BRAC migration, no changes are being made to the current system, and PVCS Version Manager supports the application as it currently runs.  Licenses currently being used at TSO-PE can not be transferred as they are supporting the production system. 

TSO-PE has used PVCS Version Manager for many years to support DCPS.  While there are other products that provide similar functions, the time spent to convert to another tool would require many system changes and require training in order to perform the conversion.  Based on the historical investment of time and money for the PVCS product, it is in the best interest of the government to continue the use of this product as opposed to changing to another one.

10.  The following DFAS provisions are included in full text in this solicitation and will be included in any resulting Order.

DFAS 52.223-9000, ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS (OCT 2007)

The Environmentally Preferable Products clause is included in this contract to articulate the Governments polices on Green Contracting.  FAR 23.403 sets forth the Federal Governments policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals.  Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection Agencys Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs).  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which designates Bio-based products.  EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials.  Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed, but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.

The recently issued Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) requires federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products.  Moreover, it now requires that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.  

 1.  	Mandatory use of Paper and other products with recycled content.
(a)	All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.
(b)	The contractor, by responding to this RFP/RFQ, affirmatively acknowledges that they will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm.   In addition, by responding to this RFQ/RFP the contractor is certifying the deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items.   

 2  	Notice of Green alternatives in Offeror's product/service.
(a)	When offering a product or service that contains Green components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm, the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote.  
(b) 	The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA Designated Products.

 3  	Affirmative Duty of Contractors to adhere to Green Contracting Policy.  
(a)	Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.
(b)  	Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.

FAR 52.211-6 - BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (AUG 1999)

FAR 13-106-2 Evaluation of Quotations or Offers.
The Government intends to evaluate quotes in response to this RFQ using the lowest price technically acceptable process.    Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes that meet or exceed the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors. The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1  Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Governments requirement and Factor 2  Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a go/no go basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a go on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offerors past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.
Factor 1  Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Governments requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the list of Salient Characteristics included elsewhere in this solicitation.  Descriptive literature means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish that, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the list of Salient Characteristics.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
                                              
Factor 2  Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offerors record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offerors adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offerors reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offerors business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>The Departments Bureau of Information Resource Management, Enterprise Network Management (IRM/OPS/ENM), requires the purchase of the Network Appliance FAS2040 and 24 by 7 phone support.  
IRM/OPS/ENM has identified the Network Appliance (NetApp) Storage System as key components within the Departments Storage Area Network (SAN)/Network Attached Storage (NAS) infrastructure both domestically and abroad.  The equipment referenced above is used to enhance the existing Department of States (DoS) enterprise storage and disaster recovery efforts used in Bureaus and posts worldwide. Network Appliance has been an approved SAN solution through the Departments corporate Change Control Board (ITCCB) since 2005.  However, IT CCB approval for use within the Department does not constitute an official endorsement of the product by the Department nor does it mean that it is mandated for use. This approval is not to be confused with standardization of a product as an authorized exception to full and open competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(4). Since the approval in 2005, data centers both domestically and overseas have built their production and recovery architecture on top of services that are unique to the NetApp software and hardware.  The lab being designed for the ARRA projects of Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM) will need to emulate our existing environment, including disaster recovery, in every detail.  The NetApp Storage System, which is approved by the Department, has one of the best internal DoS support structures, and provides disaster recovery for many of the Departments mission critical applications such as SMART, corporate email, and Passport services making this brand name a necessity.  The capability of the Network Appliance product to perform snapshots of data, integrate with third party products such as VMware and Microsoft, and provide streamlined business continuity functions lead us to a brand name only selection.  NetApp Storage System FAS2040 will provide the necessary storage and functionality to accomplish this goal.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and these ARRA project lab requirements as a key component of our lab infrastructure.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/ENM will purchase:	1 FAS2040 disk shelf with 12 1.0TB SATA Drives	2 FAS2040 system controllers	Advanced, foundation, and server software packs	2 year support. IRM requires the Network Appliance FAS2040 and direct telephone support on a brand name only basis.  Network Appliance is the manufacturer and only source for this license, which is proprietary to them.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c), is cited as the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet this projects laboratory requirements for a Storage Area Network solution that is a duplicate of the DoS current environment, has the desired performance features, and is easily installed, supportable, and cost effective.  Acquiring this product is essential for Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM) to have a sufficient lab environment to emulate the Departments production environment so that the projects are able to meet its system testing goals and objectives.  In the context of Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM), there is no practical alternative to Network Appliance as a Storage Area Network solution. 
The Network Appliance products have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for security testing, and received final approval of the IT CCB before installation. Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM) has determined that no other product would have the capabilities to meet lab environment requirements to simulate what is currently in production.  The ability to actively duplicate data on a block level, tie into third party products to streamline storage capabilities, as well as offer multiprotocol storage access on mission critical applications at a competitive rate, make Network Appliance the only product which will fulfill all requirements.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NOTICE:
The FY10 Department of Defense (DoD) appropriations bill has yet to be signed into law and the DoD is currently operating under Continuing Resolution Authority (CRA). MDA anticipates that FY10 funds will be available, after the appropriations bill has been signed into law and prior to contract award, for the execution of the Decision Support System (DSS) contract. Therefore, this solicitation is being released pursuant to FAR clause 52.232-18  Availability of Funds.

52.232-18 Availability of Funds (Apr 1984) - Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Governments obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. (End of Clause)

Note: The Industry Day #2, 23-25 Sep. 2009 Questions & Answers and Briefing Package are available in the Final Offerors Library and will not be posted separately to FedBizOpps.

INDUSTRY DAY (PRE-PROPOSAL)
Interested businesses are invited to participate in a final Government provided briefing and Question and Answer sessions on 7 January 2010; there will be no One-on-One sessions conducted.  The purpose of this Industry Day is to ensure Industry has a thorough understanding of the DSS technical and proposal requirements prior to submission of proposals. Industry will have an opportunity to suggest briefing topics using the registration form. The Pre-Proposal Industry Day will be held at Von Braun II, Redstone Arsenal, Huntsville AL. Activities will begin at 0800 on 7 January 2010.  Participation is limited to four (4) personnel per company. The Government will not compensate industry participants for travel, lodging or any other expenses associated with the Pre-Solicitation Industry Days.

Attendees must have at least a DoD Secret clearance.

OCI CONSIDERATIONS:
The acquisition of the Decision Support System services under the forthcoming solicitation may create actual or potential conflicts of interest (OCIs) for Offerors and their prospective subcontractors or other team members.  In assessing and addressing conflicts of interest, MDA will follow the guidance in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Offerors will be responsible for ensuring that they and their proposed subcontractors or other team members are not restricted from participating in the forthcoming Request for Proposal due to an OCI related to any MDA-funded contract or subcontract; Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) development, fielding and sustainment related contracts or subcontracts; or other significant, non-BMDS related business relationships with firms doing business with or in support of the MDA. 

It is MDAs policy that, consistent with GAO and court decisions, impaired objectivity (bias-type) OCIs cannot be adequately mitigated through firewalls and/or separate corporate divisions.  An impaired objectivity OCI is not mitigated if a contractor performs BMDS development, fielding or sustainment efforts and a firewalled affiliate and/or separate organizational component provides separate Decision Support System services. 

For purposes of this competition, therefore, MDA does not intend to award any contracts to any contractors, subcontractors, or other team members who also participate in a significant manner in the development, fielding or sustainment of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  Also, MDA does not intend to grant OCI waivers of bias-type (i.e. biased ground rules and impaired objectivity) as part of this procurement process when it relates to significant participants in BMDS development, fielding, or sustainment.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to procure general design services for the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communication and Public Liaison (OCPL). This acquisition is a 100% small business set-aside and and is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) under NLM-10-028/SRE. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541430 with a small business standard of $7.0 million.<br /><br />Background<br /><br />The National Library of Medicine (NLM) Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) is actively involved in responding to the 1987 Congressional mandate "...to develop outreach programs aimed at the transfer of the latest scientific findings to all health professionals...in rural communities and other areas, and, to publicize the availability of its produce and services..." This legislation was prompted, in part, by concern that information on health and biomedical topics be readily and freely available for all populations, in easy-to-understand formats.<br /><br />In response, NLM wishes to engage the services of a Contractor in designing and producing promotional materials to reach health professionals, researchers, populations in rural communities, minorities and the general public. <br /><br />Purpose<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to secure the services of a Contractor with demonstrated ability in developing strategic identities and the ability to design, implement and produce printed materials, electronic media materials, Web sites and mount custom exhibits.<br /><br />Scope of Work<br /><br />The task objectives are as follows: <br /><br />BRAND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<br /><br />As a guideline, these steps are needed to develop successful brands and graphic communication materials. <br /><br />Phase 1: Planning<br />During this phase, Contractor meets with client as often as deemed appropriate by both parties, exploring NLM programs, services, audiences, messages, communications goals, etc. A design mission statement, better known as a "creative brief" is developed, outlining and identifying these important points and elements:<br /><br />a. Brand and communication objectives<br />b. Audience demographics<br />c. Current and future communication materials - establish features and formats<br />d. Aesthetic and style considerations<br />e. Competitive or similar brands - references those and conducts a review<br />f. Visual assets <br />g. Creative and other resources<br />h. Responsibilities of client and Contractor<br />i. Schedule<br />j. Establish overall budget and specific costs<br /><br />
<p>Phase 2: Conceptual Development<br />During this phase, several creative solutions are produced that achieve the objectives and establish the tone and aesthetics for the brand. The following materials are created for review by NLM:<br /><br />a. Visual concepts<br />b. Brand messaging/writing samples<br />c. Logo designs<br />d. Proposed Imagery<br />e. Brand artwork<br /><br />After review, revisions are made to finalize the tone, the aesthetic style of the brand and the brand photography and artwork.<br /><br />Phase 3: Design<br />The brand is implemented throughout the communication materials during this phase. As each pre-determined brand component is designed, sketches and comprehensives are produced for review and evaluation by NLM. As the designs are further developed, the result will be graphic standards and templates that establish controls for typography, color, imagery and artwork. Reviews and approvals may take several rounds of revisions to receive NLM's final approval. Production specifications are coordinated for art preparation. Production costs are provided as required.<br /><br />Phase 4: Production<br />Once the design for a brand component has been approved, the design template is finalized and production files that meet the vendor specifications are prepared. The Contractor will source and create all final artwork and maintain a very high level of quality. NLM will review each production file for accuracy and quality. With NLM's approval, those files are released for the item to be produced. As the approval process requires, vendor samples will be reviewed and coordinated.<br /><br />Phase 5: Documentation<br />The brand is documented in a brief manual for future reference during this phase. All design templates are organized for easy reference and future use. The depth and detail of brand documentation will be determined by the brand management procedures NLM can institute and manage. <br />Brand management is often the factor that makes a brand successful or not. Consistent implementation of a brand is its most important aspect. For the sake of the brand, NLM should plan for detailed documentation and an easy system of accessing and archiving templates and artwork.<br /><br />Task 1: Promotional Materials for NLM Outreach<br />To successfully design the items listed below, the Vendor would meet with NLM staff again, for planning. The brand would be implemented throughout the materials specified in this solicitation and across any other materials that NLM requests. As design progresses, brand standards and templates are established for consistent brand application.<br /><br />Once design for specific promotional materials has been approved, production files are prepared and art files coordinated with prospective vendors or government agencies.<br /><br />As required, the standards and templates would be documented and the files organized for easy access.<br /><br />With more detailed information, Vendor can address the specific project requirements. The Vendor should demonstrate the ability to produce printed materials, such as: <br /><br />a. brochures, including capabilities brochures<br />b. event kits <br />c. press kits <br />d. newsletters<br />e. stationery<br />f. direct mail <br />g. event invitations<br />h. packaging displays<br />i. special items in preparation for NLM's 175th anniversary (in 2011)<br />j. other specialty items, as determined by COTR<br /><br />Task 2: Web Site Design<br />Presence on the World Wide Web is critical to communications and outreach for the National Library of Medicine. Vendor will work with COTR and other NLM staff to create messages, text and images for sections of the NLM Web site, and for other online products, perhaps to include electronic newsletter, NLM Newsroom, and other online products. Vendor will also handle all technical requirements, including the content management system, content development cycles and interactive features of the sites. Wire frames and user flows would be provided. Vendor may also interface with NLM Web experts, as directed by COTR.<br /><br />Vendor will centrally manage each of the Library's projects, placing the Vendor at the center of all activities.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number DG133W-10-RQ-0112 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and the provisions and clauses which are incorporated as part of this solicitation are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37. The NAICS code for this procurement is 721110, and the small business size standard is $7.0 million average annual receipts. This procurement is not a small business set aside. The line item being acquired is: Item 0001: In accordance with the attached Statement of Work, the Contractor shall provide facilities, lodging, food, and necessary equipment and services for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) Meteorologist/Hydrologist-In-Charge Meeting to be held April 19-23, 2010 at a location within 50 miles of NWS Headquarters (which is at 1325 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD). The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition, and there is one addendum to this provision. Specifically, this addendum is as follows. "The offeror shall provide, as part of its quotation, all of the information called for by Paragraph (b) of FAR 52.212-1. In providing the technical description called for by subparagraph (b)(4), the offeror shall separately address each aspect of the attached Statement of Work. As part of its response regarding the requirement for meal availability, the offeror shall identify the different menu options available for breakfast, lunch and dinner, together with the prices associated therewith, in order to demonstrate that attendees may eat all three daily meals at the facility within the daily Government per diem meals and incidental expenses (M&amp;IE) rate. With respect to the past performance information called for by subparagraph (b)(10), the offeror shall include three references." The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, will not be used. Award will be made to the technically acceptable offer from a responsible offeror which provides the best value to the Government. In order for an offer to be technically acceptable, the Government must determine that the offer adequately addresses all requirements of the attached Statement of Work. Elements of the Statement or Work that are indicated to be the Government's desire are not requirements; however, all other elements of the Statement of Work (other than the "Additional Information" contained in Paragraph 9 of the Statement of Work) are requirements. In order for an offeror to be responsible, the Contracting Officer must determine that the offeror complies with&nbsp;FAR 9.104. From among the pool of all technically acceptable offers from responsible offerors, the Government will determine that offer which provides the best value to the Government based on the following evaluation factors, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) the degree to which the offeror's facility and its support services will support the productivity, creativity, comfort, and convenience of the attendees; (2) past performance; and (3) price. The factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, as offers are rated closer together with respect to the non-price evaluation factors, price will become more important as a differentiating factor in the award selection. Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, "Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items," along with the offer. The clause at FAR 52.212-4, "Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items," applies to this acquisition, and there are no addenda to this clause.

Contractors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request contractors to submit additional information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts.

PART III:  PAST PERFORMANCE
Past Performance will be evaluated after the Contracting Officer has completed the technical and price evaluation.  The Government will determine whether the contractor's past performance submissions are, in order of preference, relevant, somewhat relevant or not-relevant projects, based on three factors: scope, complexity and magnitude.  
Relevant - the past performance submission meets the criteria of all three factors.Somewhat relevant - the past performance submission meets the criteria of some of the three factors.Not-relevant - the past performance submission fails to meet the criteria of all three factors.For past performance submissions determined to be relevant or somewhat relevant, the Government will make a reasonable effort to collect and evaluate past performance information from the point(s) of contact identified by the contractor on the Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire or, at the discretion of the contracting officer, other points of contact.  The contractor acknowledges that the Government is not responsible if the point of contact provided by the contractor fails to respond to the Government's past performance inquiry.  Contractors are also advised that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government, including Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS).
The Government will evaluate the contractor's Past Performance in order to assess performance risk.  The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of a contractor's performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information.  
The Past Performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106.
SELECTION
The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a purchase order using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Subpart 13.1.  The Government shall select the contractor whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, considering price and other criteria (technical submission and past performance) when compared to other quotations.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced contractor.  The Government also reserves the right to not award a contract if a contract award is not in the best interest of the Government.

This system will be used for the quantitative analysis of air particulate samples in support of air pollution research, source apportionment, and human exposure programs.  Offerors must clearly demonstrate their capability in analyzing samples by the required specifications as outlined below.
A.  MINIMUM GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS:  
The Expert Particle Analysis System comprises a high-resolution field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) coupled with a state-of ?the-art energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS) and advanced software and analytical tools customized for the EPA to facilitate manual and computer controlled SEM (CCSEM) data acquisition and data analysis of environmental samples.  The EPAS system will provide size, shape, images, and elemental composition for particles ranging in size from millimeters down to tens of nanometers.  Data obtained from the EPAS will be applied in source apportionment studies, ambient air monitoring, human exposure and health effects research, nanomaterials research, and other environmental studies.
INSTRUMENT PLATFORM:
Type ? The SEM must be a Field-Emission SEM
Resolution ? Better than 2 nm resolution in high resolution mode 
Stage ? 5 axis semi-compucentric stage, with motorized x, y motions of at least 80 mm x 60 mm, with x and y axis stage movement tolerance of +/- 0.25 microns, and with position repeatability at +/- 1 micron
EDS system ? Vibration free, maintenance free, Peltier-cooled 30mm2 silicon drift detector (SDD), Energy resolution <133eV (Mn Ka, 0 ? 100,000 cps)
Sample Capacity ? Ability to load at least 20, ? inch sample stubs into the chamber at one time.
SOFTWARE FOR AUTOMATED DATA COLLECTION
CCSEM Templates ? Automated acquisition procedures provided for:  1. Particle size only analysis, 2. Particle size and elemental chemistry analysis by EDS, 3. Particle size, elemental chemistry, and microimage analysis.
Microimaging in Automated Mode ? Ability to collect microimages with enhanced pixel resolution (as opposed to electronic zoom at fixed pixel resolution) of individual particles in automated analysis mode with choice of backscattered electron (BE) signal or secondary electron (SE) signal.
DATA PROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION
Software Compatibilty ? Analytical software must be able to process existing EPA Computer Controlled Scanning Electron Microscope particle data sets acquired with Personal Scanning Electron Microscope.  Please note that sample test data will be provided upon request.  
Data Processing Features ?

Ability to define, via expressions and light scripting, custom-derived particle attributes from data elements available in standard methods.  Ability to create multiple particle data sets through parameterized methods, (i.e. varying sets of chemical elements in the quantifications and classifications) without having to re-acquire the data.  Ability to calculate ambient particle mass and elemental concentrations (ug/m3) for passive aerosol samples based on individual particle data using demonstrated procedures.  Ability to compensate for EDS background from sample substrate, e.g., carbon stripping, while accounting for particle size.  
Ability to create Ad-Hoc Data Summarizations.  Ability to create analysis project templates, and reuse settings which include particle attribute calculations, custom attributes classification methods and summaries.  The Expert Particle Analysis System should provide multiple options and techniques for advanced clustering methods for particle classification.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA)<br />BAA-01-10-VACA<br />Research and Development for Technical Collection of Intelligence
<p>FULL TEXT ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Applied Research and Development for Technical Intelligence Collection of Intelligence Open 5 Year Broad Agency Announcement.</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: BAA-01-10-VACA</p>
<p>This BAA is open to all interested parties, including FFRDC, Government, National, and academic (college and university) laboratories. This BAA is set up in two parts: 1/ BASIC BAA and 2/ CALL BAA. The two parts are explained in separate sections below.</p>
<p>Anticipated funding under this BAA (not per contract) is $6 million per Fiscal Year (FY) from FY 10 through FY 14. Individual awards will normally not exceed 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $0.1 to $2 million per year.</p>
<p>This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding.</p>
<p>BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY: On behalf of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Virginia Contracting Activity (VACA) is soliciting innovative approaches and concepts to obtain unique and creative solutions, technologies, and state of the art approaches for technical collection of intelligence to include but not limited to Measurement and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT).</p>
<p>DIA is seeking demonstrations of first or next generation prototypes that can generally be developed within 12-24 months. New systems and approaches as well as novel exploitation of existing intelligence or non-intelligence systems and data with potential to satisfy gaps in intelligence collection capabilities are of interest. MASINT is technically derived intelligence that detects, locates and identifies unique and operationally exploitable signatures of fixed and dynamic sources of interest.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to rapidly develop and field capabilities for technical collection of intelligence consistent with current priorities. DIA is tasked to research, develop, and deploy new capabilities for technical collection of intelligence to provide persistent, undetected and difficult-to-counter surveillance of intelligence targets. Collected intelligence satisfies tactical and strategic needs of the war-fighter and intelligence communities.</p>
<p>This BAA will be reviewed annually. Any updates or possible cancellation will be issued as an amendment to the BAA. This annual review and subsequent amendments to the BAA shall meet the requirement of FAR 35.016 to update the BAA notice no less frequently than annually.</p>
<p>OTHER THAN WHITE PAPERS, NO PROPOSALS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AGAINST THIS BASELINE BAA. A letter requesting a proposal (RFP) will be issued by the Contracting Officer (CO) for each call and when needed after a technical review of a white paper. Due dates and times will be specified in each letter requesting a proposal issued by the CO in accordance with the instructions for proposals in response to white papers and calls starting on page 12 of this document. There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement. Offerors MUST monitor Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov in the event this announcement is amended or CALLs are issued.</p>
<p>1/ BASIC BAA SECTION</p>
<p>White papers in response to the BASIC BAA will be accepted at any time. This BAA will remain open for White Paper submission through 1600 hours local time on the closing date, 30 November 2014. Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPERS: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a two (2) to four (4) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach solution for the relevant mission areas(s). The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper does not include a cost proposal. The white paper must include a short technical description of the concepts and planned approach to accomplish an operational demonstration of the technical objectives. It briefly describes the technologies to be pursued in the effort. White papers shall be sufficiently detailed to allow DIA to evaluate the concept's technical merit and its potential contributions to the DIA mission.</p>
<p>A Cover Sheet (Attachment 1) should be attached to the white paper. The Cover Sheet includes the anticipated period of performance as well as a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost. The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any. It is a best estimate of the anticipated cost of the effort. The ROM should be consistent with any dollar value or ranges specified in the announcement, as well as the level of work being proposed. White papers should avoid proprietary or data not critical to the idea being presented. Note: White papers already submitted under BAA-04-01-JT1 or BAA-05-01-JT2 should not be resubmitted under this BAA.</p>
<p>AREAS OF INTEREST: In order for perspective offerors to gain a clearer picture of DIA's current mission requirements and priorities it will be necessary to request mailing of classified information. Participants can request a registered mailing at the SECRET level from Mr. Miguel Guerra. His unclassified email address is miguel.guerra@patrick.af.mil. Requestors must have a SECRET facility clearance and SECRET safeguarding that can be verified through the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).</p>
<p>FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL: White papers that do not meet format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation. The white paper must be formatted as follows: Section A: Date, Title, Company name, Period of performance, estimated cost of task (see attachment 1); Section B: Task objective, relevant mission areas(s) being addressed and relevant past performance information; and Section C: Technical summary of objectives and the operational demonstration. Multiple white papers, within the purview of this announcement, may be submitted by offerors. All white papers shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12-pitch. Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a), and in accordance with all applicable security guides. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address (both unclassified and classified if available) with their submission. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for contract award. E-mailed white paper submissions are not acceptable.</p>
<p>White papers classified SECRET COLLATERAL and below shall be addressed to the CO listed in the Current Point of Contacts Section below.</p>
<p>To submit white papers classified above SECRET COLLATERAL, contact the Security Officer Mr. David Sorter listed in the Current Point of Contacts Section below.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: The white paper will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in "DESCENDING" order of importance:</p>
<p>&bull; Overall scientific and technical merits;</p>
<p>&bull; Importance/potential to DIA's mission areas;</p>
<p>&bull; Fund availability/affordability</p>
<p><br />Individual white paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers submitted under this BAA. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>PROPOSALS: White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of the BAA may be invited to submit a formal technical and cost proposal. An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract. If requested to submit a formal proposal the offeror will be requested to do so in accordance with proposal instructions contained herein.</p>
<p>AWARD INFORMATION: Awards under this BAA will be made to offerors on the basis of the evaluation criteria above and program priorities. Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. Awards as a result of this BAA will be in the form of negotiated contracts. Options are discouraged and un-priced options will not be considered for award.</p>

<p>Other Information</p>
<p>FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: This acquisition is unrestricted. This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation paragraph 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to CALLS or approved whitepapers issued pursuant to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition In Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Organizational Conflict of Interest may apply to this action but cannot be determined prior to issuance of this announcement or subsequent CALLS. This issue and the need for applicable clauses will be resolved prior to the award of any instrument resulting from an offeror's proposal.</p>
<p>TYPES OF CONTRACTS/INSTRUMENTS: The Government reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. It is anticipated that awards under this BAA will generally be cost plus fixed fee, completion form contracts, which require successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract. The anticipated type of contract will be stated in each CALL. Prospective offerors are encouraged to discuss the type of instrument proposed with the appropriate contracting point of contact prior to preparing a proposal. Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) with Cost Plus Fixed Fee (Completion) Task Orders are also anticipated. In the event an ID/IQ type of contract is anticipated, potential offerors are advised that during the course of the contract, the maximum dollar amount of the contract is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the Government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS: The Government anticipates awarding a minimum of one contract per request for proposal; however, the Government reserves the right to make multiple awards or no awards pursuant to a CALL or whitepaper.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL COSTS: The cost of preparing Government requested proposals, in response to this announcement, is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.</p>
<p>ELECTRONIC INVOICING REQUIREMENT: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to submit invoices through the electronic invoicing internet website using procedures described at http://www.nsa.gov/business/busin00004.cfm. Access to the electronic invoicing website requires an External Certificate Authority (ECA/IECA) PKI certificate. Information on purchasing an ECA/IECA certificate is available on the internet at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html.</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTING PLANS: Small Business Subcontracting Plans are required under FAR 19.702 for efforts anticipated to exceed $550,000. Prospective offerors shall submit applicable subcontracting plans in accordance with the requirements set forth in FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.704 along with the technical and cost proposals. Small business is exempt from this requirement. If a company has a master subcontracting plan, as described in FAR 19.701 or a comprehensive subcontracting plan, as described in DFARS 219.702, a copy of the plan shall be submitted with the proposal. The subcontracting plan is a part of the cost/business section of the proposal and will not be included in the page count.</p>
<p>ASSOCIATE CONTRACTOR AGREEMENTS: Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The contracting officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the contracting officer will identify associate contractors with whom agreements are required.</p>
<p>ITEM IDENTIFICATION AND VALUATION: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Apr 2005) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/uid/.</p>
<p>FORWARD PRICING RATE AGREEMENTS: Offerors who have forward pricing rate agreements (FPRA's) and forward pricing rate recommendations (FPRR's) should submit them with their proposal.</p>
<p>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY (EEO) REGULATIONS: Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Pre-award Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward . This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past two years with The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a pre-award clearance from the OFCCP.</p>
<p>EXCESSIVE PASS-THROUGH CHARGES: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.215-7004, Excessive Pass-Through Charges, (Apr 2007).</p>
<p>NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. The program office has contracted for various non-government scientific, engineering, technical and administrative staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. All non-government contractor support personnel have signed and are bound by the appropriate non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. Non-government staff support personnel will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as Government Access Only. Proposals labeled by the offerors as for "Administrative Purposes Only" will only be handled by non-government staff support contractors in an administrative role. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.</p>
<p>Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the CO and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. All evaluations and selections under this BAA will be made only by Government evaluators. Non-government staff support contractors may serve as technical advisors in the evaluation of proposals. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>DATA DELIVERABLES: The following data deliverables are representative of the types of data that may be required: (a) Program Plan with updates as needed; (b) Monthly Status/Financial Reports; (c) Final Report, draft and final; (d) Presentation Materials, (e) Patent Reports; and (f) Unique Identification Designator (UID) Report. Data deliverables are subject to negotiations on each individual award. Other deliverables that could be required include but are not limited to: (a) Hardware or Software Prototypes (to demonstrate and/or implement a concept); (b) Demonstration of Prototype or Advanced Technology.</p>
<p>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS (FFRDCS): FFRDCs may submit proposals in response to this announcement. FFRDCs or contractors that propose using FFRDCs shall provide rationale in its proposal that the research is within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort or special competency of the FFRDC and that research to be performed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with the private sector. The Government does not intend that FFRDCs use privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector. If a contractor proposes using a FFRDC as a subcontractor, other than DOD-sponsored FFRDCs in the capacities discussed in DFARS 235.017, it must provide rationale in its proposal that supports the unique capability of the FFRDC. Also, the contractor's proposal must demonstrate that the FFRDC can accept work from other than the sponsor.</p>
<p>U.S. EXPORT CONTROL LAWS: Data subject to U.S. Export Control Laws may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) may submit proposals.

<p>d. The cost proposal should be limited to the minimum number of pages necessary to satisfy the specific requirements, however offerors are requested to keep cost proposals to 50 pages as a goal. Submit the electronic copy of the cost proposal worksheets on a compact disk in a PC compatible file format in Microsoft Office Excel 2003 or later version.

<p><br />PROPOSAL REVIEW AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL: The Government reserves the right to select for award to responsible offerors/contractors any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time. You may be ineligible for award if all requirements of this announcement and subsequent CALLS are not met by the proposal due date and time. At minimum, incomplete proposals may be given lower priority and, although technically acceptable, not awarded due to funding limitations. No further evaluation criteria will be used.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 35.016. The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process, in conjunction with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>&bull; Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal;</p>
<p>&bull; Importance to DIA's mission areas;</p>
<p>&bull; Fund availability/affordability</p>
<p>Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. All responsible organizations may submit a proposal that shall be considered.</p>
<p>REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>CATEGORY I: Well conceived scientifically and technically sound proposals important to program goals and objectives. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance subject to funding constraints.</p>
<p>CATEGORY II: Scientifically or technically sound proposals that may require further development and may be recommended for acceptance, but are at a lower priority than Category I proposals and are not always funded.</p>
<p>CATEGORY III: Proposals not technically sound or do not meet agency needs and may be recommended for rejection.</p>
<p>AWARD NOTICES: An award notice will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website under this BAA for each call in a reasonable amount of time after award. Offerors will be notified in writing whether or not their proposal is recommended for award. An award recommendation is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract or assistance instrument is assured as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award. Offerors are cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to obligate funds and commit the Government.</p>
<p>DEBRIEFINGS: When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content will vary to be consistent with the procedures set out in FAR 35.016 governing BAAs.</p>

<p>14. Interdivisional transfers (detailed breakout of costs)</p>
<p>a. Subcontractors: Subcontractors' proposals must be similarly structured. All subcontracted work must be properly identified as such. If a subcontractor elects to submit an abbreviated proposal, it is the offeror's responsibility to see that the subcontractor submits the information requested in paragraph 4(e)(1) or (2) above and submits the proposal directly to the Government's point of contact. The offeror must ensure that the subcontractor adheres to the guidance set forth herein. FAR 15.404-3 requires that the offeror provide an analysis of subcontractors' cost proposals. To that end, offeror's proposal must:</p>
<p>(1) Identify principal items/services to be subcontracted.</p>
<p>(2) Identify prospective subcontractors and the basis on which they were selected. If non-competitive, provide selected source justification</p>
<p>(3) Identify the type of contractual business arrangement contemplated for the subcontract and provide a rationale for same.</p>
<p>(4) Identify the basis for the subcontract costs (e.g., firm quote or engineering estimate, etc).</p>
<p>(5) Identify the cost or pricing data or information other than cost or pricing data submitted by the subcontractor.</p>
<p>(6) Provide an analysis of the proposed subcontract in accordance with FAR 15.404-3(b). Provide an analysis concerning the reasonableness, realism and completeness of each subcontractor's proposal. If the analysis is based on comparison with prior prices, identify the basis on which the prior prices were determined to be reasonable. The analysis should include, but not be limited to, an analysis of: materials, labor, travel, other direct costs and proposed profit or fee rates. A guide as to how the analysis may be performed is located on Attachment No. 2.</p>
<p>b. Changes to Pricing Proposals: Changes to previously submitted proposals must include documentation indicating how a previously submitted proposal is impacted or affected.</p>
<p>(1) If changes to the original proposal are relatively insignificant and involve only minor changes to elements such as labor rates, overhead and General and Administrative (G&amp;A) rates, bill of material changes, travel costs, and Other Direct Costs (ODC's), these change can be accomplished through the use of change pages or slip pages accompanied by new cost summaries.</p>

Offerors should have the capability to overhaul at least the estimated maximum of 150 (per vendor) MT654 Allison Transmissions in accordance with Allison Standards within the prescribed contract year (max required 25 per month). Actual or perceived misrepresentations of the offerors overhaul capacity discovered prior to or after contract award are subject to being deemed non-responsive or contract termination for the convenience of the Government. 

-	Awarded contractor will also provide a weekly status report of the MT654 Transmission overhaul. The status report will include but is not limited to nomenclature, P/N, order #; qty left on order, qty at facility, lead time and estimated delivery date.

Technical: Offerors must submit a proposal that includes detailed information about their overhaul process as a requirement of technical acceptability standards to be considered for an award. A proposal that merely reiterates or promises to accomplish the requirements of the RFP will be considered non-responsive. The OEM holds the proprietary technical specifications. This acquisition of services is restricted to qualified Allison Transmission technicians with the required tool pack for service and overhaul process in order to maintain the quality of the MT654 Transmission. Any offerors submitting a proposal without the appropriate qualifications will be dismissed without discussion as not being technically acceptable to the Governments requirements. Firms that recognize and can service the required item described above are encouraged to submit a proposal. 
  - Mandatory replacement parts irrespective of MT654 Transmission Core condition (see attached).  
  - Transmission will be painted (color and type to be determined).

The Government recognizes and expects the learning curve to vary between offerors and is taken into consideration. 
Cost: The award will be determined by the offer that is Lowest Price and Technically Acceptable. A technically acceptable proposal is one in which the contractor meets all requirements listed in the solicitation. Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly explained in the price proposal.  For example, if unique and innovative approaches or conditions are the basis for an unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented.  
-	Delivery costs of the MT654 transmission shall be borne by the awarded contract offeror to and from the KS-RSMS and therefore offerors should take this into consideration when submitting a proposal. The proposal should include details concerning the shipping method of the transmission cores. The KS-RSMS will provide transmission cradles for the purpose of shipping to and from the KS-RSMS facility if requested in the proposal by the offeror. Returned Transmissions should be sufficiently covered or crated to protect the completed cores against miscellaneous damage. 

First Article: First article to be provided to customer (KS RSMS) within 15 working days of core pick up for evaluation. Successful inspection of first article by KS RSMS is required prior to award. The submitted proposal shall include the cost of the first article but this cost is not included in the final award determination. Any offeror that has previously performed this service for the KS-RSMS within the past two years in a technically acceptable manner is exempt from the first article requirement. First article approval will be in accordance with FAR 52.209-3 for which paragraph a-g will apply.  

Clarification of Standards: This overhaul procedure is required to return the MT654 Transmission to a FULLY SERVICEABLE condition IAW Allison Transmission overhaul standards. The transmission will be rebuilt to all OEM torques and settings; therefore items received for repair will NOT be reconfigured to cause a change in the model designation. This procedure is NOT a reconditioning as defined by FAR PART 52.211-5 MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, which means restored to the original normal operating condition by readjustments and material replacement as needed. The mandatory replacement parts attached to this solicitation do apply (ref NMWR 9-2520-594). 

-	It shall be the obligation of the offeror to exercise due diligence to discover and to bring to the attention of the Contracting Officer at the earliest possible time any ambiguities, discrepancies, inconsistencies, or conflicts in or between the specifications and the applicable drawings or other documents incorporated by reference herein. The offeror may, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, be asked to provide clarifications regarding their proposals. The offeror shall be held responsible for the validity of all information supplied in their proposal. Should subsequent investigation disclose that the facts and conditions were not as stated; the proposal and/or award may be terminated for the convenience of the Government due to non-technical acceptability of Government requirements.

Warranty: KS RSMS is requiring the awarded contractor(s) to provide a 1 year warranty from date of installation or 18 months from date of shipment from supplier (whichever occurs first) for each overhauled MT654 transmission core. The warranty will only be applicable to the workmanship and not misuse. If the transmission fails incoming inspection the KS RSMS will log the failure on a quality deficiency report (QDR) and contact awarded contractor(s) for corrective action. The contractor(s) must be able to service these units within the warranty period on-site within the Continental United States and should consider this factor when submitting a bid.

Past Performance: Information should include a list of prior contracts for this item awarded within the past 3 years if applicable. The information shall include a valid point of contact, mailing address, telephone number, contract number and dollar amount. It is incumbent upon the offeror to include the most current contact information of prior contracts.  Not doing so or having negative past performance with a previous vendor may cause the offeror to be found not technically acceptable and removed from consideration of award. 

-	Past Performance while not a sole indicator of the offerors ability to meet the Governments requirement, it is still a consideration factor to assess an offerors technical acceptability (i.e. the lowest price that meets the Governments technical requirement will be awarded). The responsibility of clarifying corrected past performance issues is solely incumbent upon the offeror. The final determination is at the discretion of the Contract Officer making the award.  

Proposed Deviations: If the offeror takes exception to any of the requirements specified in this solicitation, the offeror shall clearly identify each such exception and include a complete explanation of why the proposed deviation was made and what benefit accrues to the Government. All deviations should be accompanied with supporting rationale and clearly labeled "Deviation". An addendum is only required if the offeror takes exception to any requirement in the solicitation. (The Addendum does not have a page limitation, but shall only include information relevant to exceptions taken to the solicitation requirements.)  The Government will assume an offeror takes no exceptions to any solicitation requirement if the offeror does not submit an addendum identifying proposed deviations. Offerors are advised that solicitation requirements are not necessarily negotiable and such deviations may render an offeror's proposal unacceptable and ineligible for award.  

Proposal Preparation Instructions: These instructions prescribe describe the approach for the development and presentation of the proposed data. The proposal shall include all of the information requested in the specific instructions. Failure to include all information requested may result in the dismissal of a proposal as non-responsive. This RFP does not commit the Government to pay costs incurred in preparation and submission of proposal information. 

-	Proposal format is subjective to the offerors preferred format that is orderly and sufficiently documented. Offerors are cautioned to submit enough information to enable the Government to fully ascertain each offerors capability to perform all of the requirements for a fair and thorough evaluation. It is requested that the priced items of the proposal are listed separately on their own page.
  
-	All commitments made in the proposal may become a part of the resultant contract. The data submitted with each proposal should be complete and concise, but not overly elaborate. Any materials submitted but not required by this solicitation, (such as company brochures), shall be relegated to appendices. Excessive reliance on promotional brochures is discouraged. Elaborate format and binding are neither necessary nor desirable. Submit proposals to the attention of CPT Robert M. Parvin, 2737 Kansas Ave, Topeka, KS 66611 or via e-mail at robert.parvin@us.army.mil not later than 2pm Central Standard Time on the designated response date listed in this Synopsis/Solicitation.

Such changes, if any, will be announced by an amendment or amendments to this Request for Proposal.

<p>TITLE: Software and Systems Test Track</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA #06-13-IFKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 07 by 31 May 2007; FY 08 by 31 December 2007; FY 09 by 31 December 2008 and, FY 10 by 31 December 2009. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 March 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Background:<br />It is increasingly difficult to create software to deal successfully with increased device and system complexity. Moreover, networked distributed systems create vast increases in the scale and scope of information processing applications, exacerbating the challenges to the system engineers' ability to specify, design, build, verify and test software. This situation is an emerging issue in information technology in general, but the requirement of military systems set them sharply apart from non-military applications in terms of reliability, robustness, security, interoperability and real time operation.</p>
<p>Business, government, and technical endeavors ranging from financial transactions to space missions increasingly require complex software systems to function correctly. The complexity of the software arises from stringent requirements (e.g., for reliability in performance and integrity of the data used), the need to support a range of interactions with the environment in real time, and/or certain structural features. These attributes make software difficult to produce.</p>
<p>Major hardware-software failures in defense acquisition programs have occurred both because components were expected to interoperate properly and they did not, as well as the fact that tools did not work as advertised. Interoperability is required for network centric environments but reality has shown it very difficult to achieve. A scalable, flexible, realistic synthetic testing environment is required for stressing tools against key benchmarks, assessment of the utility of tools by key program offices as well as use as a synthetic environment for testing tools against large systems (tens of millions of SLOC or larger) or systems-of-systems.</p>
<p>Software intensive systems are critical to meeting demands of current and future warfighting capabilities. The costs of development of these systems -- in terms of dollars, time and human resources are increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>&bull; Approximately 40% of DoD's RTD&amp;E budget is currently spent on software development, and this is expected to increase.</p>
<p>&bull; "The (Army FCS) software task alone is five times larger than that required for Joint Strike Fighter and ten times larger than the F-22, which after two decades is finally meeting its software requirements." -- Congressman Curt Weldon (April, 2004)</p>
<p>The complexity of current and emerging systems and systems of systems (SoS) requires breakthrough approaches in system development including new tools and methodologies spanning the entire system lifecycle from architecture design to system and SoS verification. One of the risk factors affecting the transitionability of such research is the difficulty of validating and verifying the functionality of research technologies against realistic problems.</p>
<p>The poor collaboration among people working across the technology maturity lifecycle has created a "valley of disappointment" where DoD programs fail to adopt advanced technologies, regardless of their inherent promise. A regime of ad hoc policies and procedures for transitioning software research into software practice in avionics and other domains has arisen for technology transitioning.</p>
<p>The expectation is that promising work funded by one organization early in the lifecycle, e.g., a DARPA program focusing on Science and Technology, will be perpetuated by another organization in the following phase, e.g., an AFRL program on Research &amp; Engineering. The DoD has over 100 separate organizations engaged in technology transfer. The current strategy and the number of organizations involved makes it hard for knowledgeable people across the Technology Readiness Lifecycle - customers, researchers, engineers, and operators - to collaborate and plan for transition.</p>
<p>Program Engineers typically view new development tools and runtime platforms as risky due to:</p>
<p>&bull; Insufficient evidence to prove their capabilities can payoff in production environments,</p>
<p>&bull; Immature prototypes that lack stability, features, user support, training, and technology-to-tool chain integrations, and</p>
<p>&bull; The absence of affordable and sustainable long-term commercial support plans. Software-Intensive Systems Producibility researchers typically assume others in government or commercial market place will address these problems.</p>
<p>It is the intent of Systems and Software Test Track to help address all of the above issues.</p>
<p>Objective:</p>
<p>The overall objective of this Systems and Software Test Track (SSTT) BAA program is to provide an open framework environment where an assortment of experimental tools and products may be deployed and allowed to interact in real-time, interactive, evolutionary and interdependent means, thereby allowing rigorous testing of new technologies, methodologies and theories in support of the Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative (SISPI). The Systems and Software Test Track will facilitate testing of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility research products and methods, provide an environment for research of DoD embedded systems and software problems, provide an ability for university and industry leverage of technology development, and establish a capability for successful technology transition and transfer.</p>
<p>The SSTT is intended to be an open collaborative research and development environment to demonstrate, evaluate, and document the ability of novel tools, methods, techniques, and technologies to yield affordable and more predictable production of software intensive systems. The SSTT system will bring together researchers, developers, and domain experts from different communities to de-fragment the knowledge necessary to achieve SISPI research, development and technology transition.</p>
<p>The SSTT will be a system where SISPI researchers can test their research against relevant challenge problems, and where independent analysis of SISPI research can be preformed. This independent analysis would enable the SSTT to support acquisition program offices and analyze utility of tools. Also, SSTT users can bring their unsolved problems to provide challenges that drive SiSPI research where no such tools are available, or search for a solution by leveraging existing capabilities available in the SSTT.</p>
<p>The SSTT will have several logical roles of collaborating participants: Challenge Problem Provider (for providing challenge problems), Candidate Solution Provider (for providing candidate solutions to challenge problems), Experimenter (for running experiments and collecting experimental results), Collaborators (involved in collaborating on challenge problems, candidate solutions, and/or experiments), Solution Inquirer (actively searching for a needed capability) and SSTT Administrators (responsible for administering the SSTT infrastructure). Various community participants may play one or more of these logical roles. SSTT will enable Program Engineers from DoD Acquisition Programs to interact with SISPI Researchers from Industry Labs or Universities to define, discover and evaluate SISPI technology.</p>
<p>Phase 1 consisted of defining, developing, and documenting the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), a user-oriented document that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from the users' viewpoint; and defining, developing and documenting the architecture and the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution. Initial concepts along with the final CONOPS and architectures were presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia. Two awards were made and all documentation is available on the BCSW server (please contact steven.drager@rl.af.mil to request access). The CONOPS is posted on FedBizOpps along with this modification 1. Phase II is the environmental development and operations phase.</p>
<p>The environment is open and available for use by developers as well as independent analysis by the facility operators. This independent analysis allows the facility operators to be supportive to major defense acquisition program offices as well as analyzing the utility of tools. Program offices may bring their unsolved problems to the test track for either help in solving or by looking for needed utility amongst the tools available. Lastly, this synthetic environment should provide a place where big codes can be tested allowing requirements verification prior to production and deployment. This risk reduction affords the ability to verify and validate functionality of today's complex software intensive systems while providing a realistic environment for researchers to verify their tools against realistic problems.</p>
<p>The Systems and Software Test Track provides a place for experimental verification of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility technologies due to their novelty and the potential complexity of the underlying theories. The experimental platforms incorporate software technology to instrument, monitor and test large-scale applications. Challenge problems for the open experimental platforms are accessible for all the research teams. The experimental platform research includes subtasks to conduct large-scale coordination experiments, and to develop methods and tools for evaluating aggregate performance of applications. This environment provides a full range of collaborative technology challenges, run-time platforms and applications, experiments, evaluations, and demonstrations. A Common infrastructure will enable control and data flow between both kinds of application components for a distributed environment. The open experimentation environment will provide the fundamental reference architecture and underpinnings helping researchers to develop and test their designs as well as facilitates transition of promising technologies into production use.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas:<br />The primary goal of Phase 3 is to research, design and experiment within the SSTT implementation, called SPRUCE. This involves development of challenge problems and artifacts, and/or solutions to challenge problems, and/or experiments which validate solution of challenge problems. Areas to consider for challenge problems, solutions and experiments include providing software artifacts, benchmarks, executables, source code, design documents, requirements documents, examples, models, fault data, lessons learned, software construction files and tools but are not limited to the technologies listed below:<br />&bull; Challenges problems, solutions and experiments currently listed in SPRUCE<br />&bull; Provably Correct Code Generation and Automatic Software/System Analysis<br />&bull; Software and Systems Composability <br />&bull; Guarantee System Interoperability<br />&bull; Provably Trusted Components (COTS/GOTS/Hardware) <br />&bull; Model-Based Development for Predictable Software Attributes<br />&bull; Predicting the "-ilities" Early in the Life Cycle<br />&bull; Emerging Technologies' Affect on Software<br />&bull; Automatic Software Optimization (Performance, Power Consumption, ...)<br />&bull; Software Conversion to New Technology (Multi-Core, Cell, ...)<br />&bull; Fighting through Software Failures<br />&bull; Understanding Software<br />&bull; Cyber Critical Software (variant of flight critical software)<br />&bull; Measurement Techniques and Software Forensics</p>

<p>TITLE: Software and Systems Test Track</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA #06-13-IFKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 07 by 31 May 2007; FY 08 by 31 December 2007; FY 09 by 31 December 2008 and, FY 10 by 31 December 2009. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 March 2010, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Background:<br />It is increasingly difficult to create software to deal successfully with increased device and system complexity. Moreover, networked distributed systems create vast increases in the scale and scope of information processing applications, exacerbating the challenges to the system engineers' ability to specify, design, build, verify and test software. This situation is an emerging issue in information technology in general, but the requirement of military systems set them sharply apart from non-military applications in terms of reliability, robustness, security, interoperability and real time operation.</p>
<p>Business, government, and technical endeavors ranging from financial transactions to space missions increasingly require complex software systems to function correctly. The complexity of the software arises from stringent requirements (e.g., for reliability in performance and integrity of the data used), the need to support a range of interactions with the environment in real time, and/or certain structural features. These attributes make software difficult to produce.</p>
<p>Major hardware-software failures in defense acquisition programs have occurred both because components were expected to interoperate properly and they did not, as well as the fact that tools did not work as advertised. Interoperability is required for network centric environments but reality has shown it very difficult to achieve. A scalable, flexible, realistic synthetic testing environment is required for stressing tools against key benchmarks, assessment of the utility of tools by key program offices as well as use as a synthetic environment for testing tools against large systems (tens of millions of SLOC or larger) or systems-of-systems.</p>
<p>Software intensive systems are critical to meeting demands of current and future warfighting capabilities. The costs of development of these systems -- in terms of dollars, time and human resources are increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>&bull; Approximately 40% of DoD's RTD&amp;E budget is currently spent on software development, and this is expected to increase.</p>
<p>&bull; "The (Army FCS) software task alone is five times larger than that required for Joint Strike Fighter and ten times larger than the F-22, which after two decades is finally meeting its software requirements." -- Congressman Curt Weldon (April, 2004)</p>
<p>The complexity of current and emerging systems and systems of systems (SoS) requires breakthrough approaches in system development including new tools and methodologies spanning the entire system lifecycle from architecture design to system and SoS verification. One of the risk factors affecting the transitionability of such research is the difficulty of validating and verifying the functionality of research technologies against realistic problems.</p>
<p>The poor collaboration among people working across the technology maturity lifecycle has created a "valley of disappointment" where DoD programs fail to adopt advanced technologies, regardless of their inherent promise. A regime of ad hoc policies and procedures for transitioning software research into software practice in avionics and other domains has arisen for technology transitioning.</p>
<p>The expectation is that promising work funded by one organization early in the lifecycle, e.g., a DARPA program focusing on Science and Technology, will be perpetuated by another organization in the following phase, e.g., an AFRL program on Research &amp; Engineering. The DoD has over 100 separate organizations engaged in technology transfer. The current strategy and the number of organizations involved makes it hard for knowledgeable people across the Technology Readiness Lifecycle - customers, researchers, engineers, and operators - to collaborate and plan for transition.</p>
<p>Program Engineers typically view new development tools and runtime platforms as risky due to:</p>
<p>&bull; Insufficient evidence to prove their capabilities can payoff in production environments,</p>
<p>&bull; Immature prototypes that lack stability, features, user support, training, and technology-to-tool chain integrations, and</p>
<p>&bull; The absence of affordable and sustainable long-term commercial support plans. Software-Intensive Systems Producibility researchers typically assume others in government or commercial market place will address these problems.</p>
<p>It is the intent of Systems and Software Test Track to help address all of the above issues.</p>
<p>Objective:</p>
<p>The overall objective of this Systems and Software Test Track (SSTT) BAA program is to provide an open framework environment where an assortment of experimental tools and products may be deployed and allowed to interact in real-time, interactive, evolutionary and interdependent means, thereby allowing rigorous testing of new technologies, methodologies and theories in support of the Software-Intensive Systems Producibility Initiative (SISPI). The Systems and Software Test Track will facilitate testing of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility research products and methods, provide an environment for research of DoD embedded systems and software problems, provide an ability for university and industry leverage of technology development, and establish a capability for successful technology transition and transfer.</p>
<p>The SSTT is intended to be an open collaborative research and development environment to demonstrate, evaluate, and document the ability of novel tools, methods, techniques, and technologies to yield affordable and more predictable production of software intensive systems. The SSTT system will bring together researchers, developers, and domain experts from different communities to de-fragment the knowledge necessary to achieve SISPI research, development and technology transition.</p>
<p>The SSTT will be a system where SISPI researchers can test their research against relevant challenge problems, and where independent analysis of SISPI research can be preformed. This independent analysis would enable the SSTT to support acquisition program offices and analyze utility of tools. Also, SSTT users can bring their unsolved problems to provide challenges that drive SiSPI research where no such tools are available, or search for a solution by leveraging existing capabilities available in the SSTT.</p>
<p>The SSTT will have several logical roles of collaborating participants: Challenge Problem Provider (for providing challenge problems), Candidate Solution Provider (for providing candidate solutions to challenge problems), Experimenter (for running experiments and collecting experimental results), Collaborators (involved in collaborating on challenge problems, candidate solutions, and/or experiments), Solution Inquirer (actively searching for a needed capability) and SSTT Administrators (responsible for administering the SSTT infrastructure). Various community participants may play one or more of these logical roles. SSTT will enable Program Engineers from DoD Acquisition Programs to interact with SISPI Researchers from Industry Labs or Universities to define, discover and evaluate SISPI technology.</p>
<p>Phase 1 consisted of defining, developing, and documenting the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), a user-oriented document that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from the users' viewpoint; and defining, developing and documenting the architecture and the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution. Initial concepts along with the final CONOPS and architectures were presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia. Two awards were made and all documentation is available on the BCSW server (please contact steven.drager@rl.af.mil to request access). The CONOPS is posted on FedBizOpps along with this modification 1. Phase II is the environmental development and operations phase.</p>
<p>The environment is open and available for use by developers as well as independent analysis by the facility operators. This independent analysis allows the facility operators to be supportive to major defense acquisition program offices as well as analyzing the utility of tools. Program offices may bring their unsolved problems to the test track for either help in solving or by looking for needed utility amongst the tools available. Lastly, this synthetic environment should provide a place where big codes can be tested allowing requirements verification prior to production and deployment. This risk reduction affords the ability to verify and validate functionality of today's complex software intensive systems while providing a realistic environment for researchers to verify their tools against realistic problems.</p>
<p>The Systems and Software Test Track provides a place for experimental verification of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility technologies due to their novelty and the potential complexity of the underlying theories. The experimental platforms incorporate software technology to instrument, monitor and test large-scale applications. Challenge problems for the open experimental platforms are accessible for all the research teams. The experimental platform research includes subtasks to conduct large-scale coordination experiments, and to develop methods and tools for evaluating aggregate performance of applications. This environment provides a full range of collaborative technology challenges, run-time platforms and applications, experiments, evaluations, and demonstrations. A Common infrastructure will enable control and data flow between both kinds of application components for a distributed environment. The open experimentation environment will provide the fundamental reference architecture and underpinnings helping researchers to develop and test their designs as well as facilitates transition of promising technologies into production use.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas:<br />The primary goal of Phase 3 is to research, design and experiment within the SSTT implementation, called SPRUCE. This involves development of challenge problems and artifacts, and/or solutions to challenge problems, and/or experiments which validate solution of challenge problems. Areas to consider for challenge problems, solutions and experiments include providing software artifacts, benchmarks, executables, source code, design documents, requirements documents, examples, models, fault data, lessons learned, software construction files and tools but are not limited to the technologies listed below:<br />&bull; Challenges problems, solutions and experiments currently listed in SPRUCE<br />&bull; Provably Correct Code Generation and Automatic Software/System Analysis<br />&bull; Software and Systems Composability <br />&bull; Guarantee System Interoperability<br />&bull; Provably Trusted Components (COTS/GOTS/Hardware) <br />&bull; Model-Based Development for Predictable Software Attributes<br />&bull; Predicting the "-ilities" Early in the Life Cycle<br />&bull; Emerging Technologies' Affect on Software<br />&bull; Automatic Software Optimization (Performance, Power Consumption, ...)<br />&bull; Software Conversion to New Technology (Multi-Core, Cell, ...)<br />&bull; Fighting through Software Failures<br />&bull; Understanding Software<br />&bull; Cyber Critical Software (variant of flight critical software)<br />&bull; Measurement Techniques and Software Forensics</p>

<p>The SSTT will have several logical roles of collaborating participants: Challenge Problem Provider (for providing challenge problems), Candidate Solution Provider (for providing candidate solutions to challenge problems), Experimenter (for running experiments and collecting experimental results), Collaborators (involved in collaborating on challenge problems, candidate solutions, and/or experiments), Solution Inquirer (actively searching for a needed capability) and SSTT Administrators (responsible for administering the SSTT infrastructure). Various community participants may play one or more of these logical roles. SSTT will enable Program Engineers from DoD Acquisition Programs to interact with SISPI Researchers from Industry Labs or Universities to define, discover and evaluate SISPI technology.</p>
<p>Phase 1 consisted of defining, developing, and documenting the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), a user-oriented document that describes system characteristics for a proposed system from the users' viewpoint; and defining, developing and documenting the architecture and the fundamental organization of the Systems and Software Test Track as embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution. Initial concepts along with the final CONOPS and architectures were presented to representatives from Government, Industry and Academia. Two awards were made and all documentation is available on the BCSW server (please contact steven.drager@rl.af.mil to request access). The CONOPS is posted on FedBizOpps along with this modification 1. Phase II is the environmental development and operations phase.</p>
<p>The environment is open and available for use by developers as well as independent analysis by the facility operators. This independent analysis allows the facility operators to be supportive to major defense acquisition program offices as well as analyzing the utility of tools. Program offices may bring their unsolved problems to the test track for either help in solving or by looking for needed utility amongst the tools available. Lastly, this synthetic environment should provide a place where big codes can be tested allowing requirements verification prior to production and deployment. This risk reduction affords the ability to verify and validate functionality of today's complex software intensive systems while providing a realistic environment for researchers to verify their tools against realistic problems.</p>
<p>The Systems and Software Test Track provides a place for experimental verification of Software-Intensive Systems Producibility technologies due to their novelty and the potential complexity of the underlying theories. The experimental platforms incorporate software technology to instrument, monitor and test large-scale applications. Challenge problems for the open experimental platforms are accessible for all the research teams. The experimental platform research includes subtasks to conduct large-scale coordination experiments, and to develop methods and tools for evaluating aggregate performance of applications. This environment provides a full range of collaborative technology challenges, run-time platforms and applications, experiments, evaluations, and demonstrations. A Common infrastructure will enable control and data flow between both kinds of application components for a distributed environment. The open experimentation environment will provide the fundamental reference architecture and underpinnings helping researchers to develop and test their designs as well as facilitates transition of promising technologies into production use.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas:<br />The primary goal of Phase 3 is to research, design and experiment within the SSTT implementation, called SPRUCE. This involves development of challenge problems and artifacts, and/or solutions to challenge problems, and/or experiments which validate solution of challenge problems. Areas to consider for challenge problems, solutions and experiments include providing software artifacts, benchmarks, executables, source code, design documents, requirements documents, examples, models, fault data, lessons learned, software construction files and tools but are not limited to the technologies listed below:<br />&bull; Challenges problems, solutions and experiments currently listed in SPRUCE<br />&bull; Provably Correct Code Generation and Automatic Software/System Analysis<br />&bull; Software and Systems Composability <br />&bull; Guarantee System Interoperability<br />&bull; Provably Trusted Components (COTS/GOTS/Hardware) <br />&bull; Model-Based Development for Predictable Software Attributes<br />&bull; Predicting the "-ilities" Early in the Life Cycle<br />&bull; Emerging Technologies' Affect on Software<br />&bull; Automatic Software Optimization (Performance, Power Consumption, ...)<br />&bull; Software Conversion to New Technology (Multi-Core, Cell, ...)<br />&bull; Fighting through Software Failures<br />&bull; Understanding Software<br />&bull; Cyber Critical Software (variant of flight critical software)<br />&bull; Measurement Techniques and Software Forensics</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 651 Aeronautical Systems Squadron (AESS) (B-52)Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB), Ohio
1.0	Description
1.1 Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) in support of the 651 AESS is seeking information on the capability of existing radar systems as potential replacements for the current B-52H strategic radar system, and on contractors who are interested in designing, developing, integrating, and supporting the test program for a new/replacement radar system for the current B-52H AN/APQ-166 radar.

1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Air Force is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertainin! g to this requirement.
2.0	Background
The Government is investigating the possibility of initiating a B-52H strategic radar replacement program.  The objective would be to identify, integrate, test, produce, and field a replacement radar system to address supportability issues beginning in 2016.
The AN/APQ-166 Mechanically Scanned Array (MSA) radar system currently installed on the B-52H fleet was originally fielded in the 1950s, last upgraded to its present configuration in the early 1980s, and is approaching the end of its useful life.  The antenna assembly has corrosion issues and several components of the radar system are experiencing diminishing manufacturing source/materiel shortage (DMS/MS) situations.  Forecasts indicate that the B-52H radar system will become unsupportable beginning in the 2016 timeframe. 2.1 Planned Production:  A total of 76 aircraft would require retrofit with the new radar system, along with spares and trainers
2.2 Delivery Period:  Initial production kit deliveries in FY 16
2.3 Limitations:  Maximum number of aircraft that may be retrofit in any given year is between 17 and 24
2.4 Security Requirements:  In accordance with established B-52H Weapon System Master Security Classification Guide, 2 September 2008.     For a copy of the Master Security Classification Guide please contact:
    B-52 System Program Office    327th ACSG    3001 Staff Dr.    Ste 2AG19A    Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3021    Action Officer: 540th ACSS/DO    PH: (405) 734-6003

<DESC>I. Description / Purpose:
<p>1. In partnership with the 30th and 45th Space Wings, the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Launch and Range Systems Wing (LRSW), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California is contemplating the feasibility of acquiring a long-term, follow-on contract that would consolidate the existing Spacelift Range System Contract (SLRS) contract, the Western Range Operations Communications and Information (WROCI) contract, and the Eastern Range Technical Services (ERTS) contract.</p>
<p>2. SMC is issuing this RFI as part of its market research to determine industry's ability to integrate small business into the LISC acquisition. The Air Force is deeply committed to maximizing opportunities for small businesses and meeting acquisition goals. Consequently, SMC is requesting companies planning to bid on LISC as prime contractors to estimate the nominal and maximum amount of work that could be subcontracted to small business on LISC while still allowing the prime contractor to successfully perform all contract requirements (more details on how this information should be presented are outlined in Section II below). SMC is also requesting respondents to list which sections and/or subsections of the PWS are expected to be subcontracted to small businesses for both nominal and maximum estimates.</p>
<p>3. The Air Force is currently exploring four scenarios for contract requirements:</p>
<p>Scenario #1 - The current LISC baseline includes all range O&amp;M, modifications, downrange base operating support (BOS), and mission support communications (comms);</p>
<p>Scenario #2 - LISC baseline with downrange BOS excluded;</p>
<p>Scenario #3 - LISC baseline with "admin" comms excluded (note: at both 45SW &amp; 30SW "admin" comms is defined as standard base-level IT support that has no Range mission or mission support functionality; e.g., IT at Cape Canaveral AFS is not considered "admin" comms because it also provides mission/mission support comms, while IT at Patrick AFB is considered "admin" comms); and</p>
<p>Scenario #4 - LISC baseline with downrange BOS and "admin" comms excluded.</p>
<p>4. A LISC working draft PWS is attached containing all work currently envisioned as part of the LISC baseline. The PWS is currently under revision and subject to substantial changes prior to release of a more fully synthesized draft LISC PWS. Note that current draft Section 7 tasks should be considered to be part of Section 3.</p>
<p>II. White Paper Content: Interested industry respondents are requested to provide a White Paper that includes answers/information with regards to the following questions/requests:</p>
<p>1. Respondents are asked to provide percentage estimates (small business dollar component divided by estimated total contract value) for both nominal and maximum small business subcontracting possibilities for each of the four scenarios described in Section I(3) above. The term "nominal" signifies the amount of small business subcontracting the contractor would employ without any requirement or goal being imposed by the Government, i.e., the amount that would generate the most efficiencies for the contractor and the Government.</p>
<p>2. For both nominal and maximum possibilities, respondents are also asked to provide the percentage of small business subcontracting (small business dollar component divided by estimated total contract value) that would be classified as "complex and meaningful" (e.g. O&amp;M, modifications, and communications support). "Complex and meaningful" work does not include BOS, vendors, and supplier services.</p>
<p>3. Respondents shall fill in the attached matrices and include them in the first page of their response. Scenario numbers correlate to those detailed in Section I(3) above</p>
<p>4. In the additional space allowed for the response, respondents shall list the sections and/or subsections of the PWS expected to be subcontracted to small businesses for both nominal and maximum estimates. Respondents shall also detail the risk associated with subcontracting the maximum amount in contrast to the nominal amount.</p>
<p>III. Industry Days: An industry day session may be scheduled, based on the results of the RFI. RFI respondents may be invited to participate in supplemental industry day one-on-one discussions with the Government to discuss their White Paper information in greater detail. However, failure to respond to the RFI does not preclude proposal submittal nor industry day participation if a formal acquisition is announced.</p>
<p>IV. Small Business Consideration: The Small Business size standard is: 1,000 employees. The Small Business point of contact is Mr. Willard Strozier at 310-653-1108. Responses from small and small disadvantaged businesses are highly encouraged. However, only companies planning to bid on LISC as prime contractors should respond to this RFI.</p>
<p>V. White Paper Classification: Respondents shall provide an unclassified response to this RFI. Respondents must indicate whether their responses contain proprietary information if the respondents wish for the responses to be handled as such.</p>
<p>VI. White Paper Format: Responses shall not exceed five (5) pages, including the matrices from Section II(4); the Government will not consider pages in excess of 5 (five) pages. Page size shall be 8.5 x 11; font size shall be 12 pt. The White Paper cover page and table of contents pages will not count against the page limit. The Government will not accept company literature or marketing materials in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>VII. Response Due Date: 16:00pm PST, 14 December, 2009.</p>
<p>VIII. Submission Instructions: Submit an electronic copy in either PDF format or Microsoft Word format to Mr. George Sullivan, at George.Sullivan@losangeles.af.mil by the Response Due Date. Hard copy responses will not be accepted.<br /><br />IX. Questions: All communication associated with this RFI shall be submitted via email to Mr. George Sullivan, at George.Sullivan@losangeles.af.mil.<br /><br />X. Point of Contact: <br />Primary: Mr. George Sullivan, contract specialist, at George.Sullivan@losangeles.af.mil <br />or (310) 653-1772 <br />Alternate:: Ms. Senah Williams, Government Contracting Officer, at Senah.williams@losangeles.af.mil or (310) 653-2487</p>
<p>XI. DECLARATION: This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein. Responses will be used by the Government for informational purposes only as part of its acquisition planning. Information obtained from responses to this RFI will not be used to exclude potential future bidders on the LISC acquisition.</p>

For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.")<BR><BR>The Departments Bureau of Information Resource Management, Enterprise Network Management (IRM/OPS/ENM), requires the purchase of the Network Appliance FAS2040 and 24 by 7 phone support.  
IRM/OPS/ENM has identified the Network Appliance (NetApp) Storage System as key components within the Departments Storage Area Network (SAN)/Network Attached Storage (NAS) infrastructure both domestically and abroad.  The equipment referenced above is used to enhance the existing Department of States (DoS) enterprise storage and disaster recovery efforts used in Bureaus and posts worldwide. Network Appliance has been an approved SAN solution through the Departments corporate Change Control Board (ITCCB) since 2005.  However, IT CCB approval for use within the Department does not constitute an official endorsement of the product by the Department nor does it mean that it is mandated for use. This approval is not to be confused with standardization of a product as an authorized exception to full and open competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(4). Since the approval in 2005, data centers both domestically and overseas have built their production and recovery architecture on top of services that are unique to the NetApp software and hardware.  The lab being designed for the ARRA projects of Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM) will need to emulate our existing environment, including disaster recovery, in every detail.  The NetApp Storage System, which is approved by the Department, has one of the best internal DoS support structures, and provides disaster recovery for many of the Departments mission critical applications such as SMART, corporate email, and Passport services making this brand name a necessity.  The capability of the Network Appliance product to perform snapshots of data, integrate with third party products such as VMware and Microsoft, and provide streamlined business continuity functions lead us to a brand name only selection.  NetApp Storage System FAS2040 will provide the necessary storage and functionality to accomplish this goal.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the DoS and these ARRA project lab requirements as a key component of our lab infrastructure.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/ENM will purchase:	1 FAS2040 disk shelf with 12 1.0TB SATA Drives	2 FAS2040 system controllers	Advanced, foundation, and server software packs	2 year support. IRM requires the Network Appliance FAS2040 and direct telephone support on a brand name only basis.  Network Appliance is the manufacturer and only source for this license, which is proprietary to them.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c), is cited as the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet this projects laboratory requirements for a Storage Area Network solution that is a duplicate of the DoS current environment, has the desired performance features, and is easily installed, supportable, and cost effective.  Acquiring this product is essential for Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM) to have a sufficient lab environment to emulate the Departments production environment so that the projects are able to meet its system testing goals and objectives.  In the context of Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM), there is no practical alternative to Network Appliance as a Storage Area Network solution. 
The Network Appliance products have undergone test and assessment, evaluation for security testing, and received final approval of the IT CCB before installation. Network Access Control/Perimeter Security (NAC/PS) and End-to-End Configuration Management (EECM) has determined that no other product would have the capabilities to meet lab environment requirements to simulate what is currently in production.  The ability to actively duplicate data on a block level, tie into third party products to streamline storage capabilities, as well as offer multiprotocol storage access on mission critical applications at a competitive rate, make Network Appliance the only product which will fulfill all requirements.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of the Chief Information Officer (USDA OCIO) plans to issue a solicitation to procure virtual world (VW) software technology. While there are Government organizations currently utilizing virtual worlds (VW) technology, significant challenges remain related to cross-agency accessibility, security, scalability, and interoperability.</p>
<p>For virtual worlds to be a viable option for widespread government use, the Government is seeking offerors who can demonstrate that the virtual worlds solution(s) can satisfactorily resolve these and other cross-agency issues.<span style="COLOR: black"> A major objective is to create a multi-agency advisory committee to create new and innovative government-wide solutions; the virtual worlds effort provides such a solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The Government does not have an expectation that any one vendor or product will satisfy all requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To that extent, the Government intends to award one or more <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts to </span>enable the Government to build, customize and host one or more interactive persistent virtual worlds where users can operate over networks for the purposes of collaboration, training, rehearsal, analysis, simulation, experimentation, and socialization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractors are advised to consider the merits of entering into partnerships or teaming arrangements to provide a solution(s).</p>
<p>The required features are desired to be similar to or better then what is available in public virtual world environments like Second Life, There.com, or World of Warcraft. The Government requires that it be able to build and host a highly reliable and available private world that, unlike the public environments, is able to operate using firewalled or classified networks and is capable of integrating with legacy and emerging technologies. In addition, the Government must completely control the hosting environment, software licenses, support contracts service levels, content, experiences, and user access.&nbsp; The Government envisions a fully immersive, persistent 3D experience using avatars as the user interface rather than more traditional 2D web based experiences. The VW infrastructure, core components, and tools must provide a complete platform to support collaboration.&nbsp; The Government envisions a solution that is extensible where specialized functionality shall be provided through the use of plug-ins developed by other Government programs and/or commercial entities that interface to the VW through open Application Programmer's Interfaces (API) and non-proprietary data formats that provide access to the internal VW data model.&nbsp; An open architecture solution is required to provide the level of interoperability and extensibility that will be necessary for the wide variety of use cases anticipated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">It is anticipated that multiple award, fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts will be awarded as a result of the solicitation. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Each contract will contain a base year and three, one-year option periods. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about December 9, 2009.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>January 11, 2010, is the anticipated due date for proposal submission, not the date for the issuance of the solicitation (refer to the solicitation for the specific proposal due date and time which may be revised based on the actual solicitation release date). This procurement will be conducted on a full and open competition basis under NAICS Code 511210. Telephone requests for the solicitation will not be honored. The RFP document will only be available through the Government Point of Entry (GPE) at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. All amendments and other information regarding the solicitation will be available at FedBizOpps. Potential offerors will be responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps for amendments, and any other procurement related information. If you have any questions regarding the FedBizOpps, please contact Robert Niedwiecki at 202-720-3211.</span></p>

GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Jackson Federal Building into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, windows, and lighting). LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/21/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/21/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC><BR>SPECIAL NOTICE:  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Nashville District would like to inform prospective offerors regarding a planned Request for Proposal (RFP) to construct a concrete seepage barrier at the main embankment of Center Hill Dam, located near Lancaster, Tennessee.  The RFP will be issued on or about 22 January 2010.  The primary feature of work is installation of an approximate 900-foot long concrete seepage barrier at the Center Hill Dam main embankment. The barrier will have a minimum 2-foot thickness and extend from elevation 696 to approximate elevation 405 msl.  The barrier will be installed through the existing earthen embankment and underlying limestone foundation.  Portions of the limestone foundation exhibits unconfined compressive strengths up to 40,000 psi, with an average of 16,000 psi; therefore, the Government prefers a combined wall constructed of hydromill and circular pile elements.  To protect the earthen embankment during construction, a concrete encasement wall is also recommended.  A grout curtain is currently being installed at the main dam embankment under separate contract.  The work will also include foundation grouting from the gallery in the 1,400-ft long concrete dam.  The solicitation does not include any work at the saddle dam, nor the right abutment or right rim as was presented at the July 2009 Industry Day event.  The Corps plans to procure construction of the main dam seepage barrier and concrete dam grout curtain using the formal best value tradeoff selection process.  <BR><BR>NOTE: This Notice is being issued for planning and informational purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice, nor will the Government accept proposals as a result of this Notice.<BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: U.S. Army Engineer District, Nashville, P.O.

<DESC>Synopsis:
RECOVERYTHIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A NOTICE FOR SOLICITATION OF OFFERS.  THE ACTION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS A MODIFICATION TO AN EXISTING CONTRACT, DOLJ09UA00028.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE CONTRACTOR IDENTIFIED BELOW.

This opportunity was available only to the Adams & Associates, Inc under contract number DOLJ09UA00028.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps intends to award a modification in the amount of $60,304 to the Gadsden Job Corps Center, operated by Adams & Associates, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceiling for Equipment and CTST on this contract.

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

The funding is intended to address the following program initiatives:  1) CTT auto and construction curriculum; 2) Career Technical Skills Training pertaining to the development of green training elements/modules in each of the priority areas (Automotive, Green and Construction Technology) of center-operated programs as detailed in Job Corps Curriculum Change Notice 09-01 and Curriculum Change Notice 09-02.  The operator of the Gadsden center will utilize these funds to make available additional Career Technical Skills Training opportunities to the students of the Gadsden Job Corps Center.  The operator of the Gadsden Job Corps Center will not procure the services through subcontracting opportunities; and 3) to be directed to electric and electric hybrid vehicles for operation on Job Corps centers. These funds may be used for all expenses related to the acquisition of electric vehicles, including purchase of vehicles, shipping and delivery costs, training on use of vehicle, and additional equipment such as batteries and supplies. In addition, Job Corps centers with automotive career technical training (CTT) programs will use this opportunity to acquire electric hybrid vehicles as student training aids, to provide hands-on technical training in green vehicle technologies. 

This Modification has been awarded on November 24, 2009.

These products utilize the LT2 Product Line and its Core Assets such as the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA), the Future Army System of Integrated Targets (FASIT), the One Tactical Engagement Simulation System (OneTESS), LT2 Common Components, LT2 Standards, the LT2 Portal, and the LT2 Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
