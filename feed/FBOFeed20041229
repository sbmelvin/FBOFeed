<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described below.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement would be 541710 "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences" (size standard 500 employees).  MMS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.  Based on the review of the responses to this RFI, the MMS may issue a small business set aside or full and open competitive requirement for Capability Statements and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against MMS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the MMS use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirements.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this RFI.  NOTE: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern.  SCOPE OF WORK: Specific study tasks will include the development and conduct of a biological field data collection/computer numerical modeling program offshore the northeast coast of Florida to address the following issues: Characterization and evaluation of benthic habitats, biological communities (infauna, epifauna, demersal, and pelagic fishes), and sediment grain size in several areas identified as potential sources of sand for beach and coast restoration/renourishment in the Florida counties of Nassau, Duval, St. Johns, Flagler and Volusia. Biological field data collected will be used in conjunction with existing literature to the maximum extent possible; Assessment of the potential effects of offshore sand dredging on benthic and pelagic communities, including an analysis of the potential rate and success of recolonization following cessation of dredging; Using the procedures and conclusions set out in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Special Report 262: A Process for Setting, Managing, and Monitoring Environmental Windows for Dredging Projects (http://trb.org//publications/sr/sr262.pdf) as a guide, development of a time schedule of environmental windows that best protects benthic and pelagic species from adverse environmental effects; Examination of the potential for alteration in the local wave field following dredging and the excavation of sand from within the potential sand borrow sites; Examination of the potential for increased wave action after dredging within the potential sand borrow sites and any resultant adverse localized changes in erosional patterns and longshore coastal transport which could result in significant losses of beach sand after renourishment; Examination of the potential for changes in local sediment transport rates as a result of altering the local bathymetry, particularly in light of the recent studies which indicate that bathymetry does influence the manner in which waves approach the shoreline during storm events; Examination of the cumulative physical effects of multiple dredging events and extraction of a large volume of material within the identified potential borrow sites.  The total performance period of this study is estimated at thirty-two (32) months.  SOURCES SOUGHT: Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 20 pages that details the small business firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  In order to compete for these requirements, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by detailing:  (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the tasks with their qualifications, their specific experience, and publication record in peer reviewed scientific journals; (2) your access to equipment and facilities necessary to accomplish the tasks; (3) your organization's prior experience conducting monitoring projects of similar scope and complexity; and (4) specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with point of contact & phone number & email address) for previous work of this nature that key personnel or organization has performed within the last three years (references will be checked).  If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  RESPONSES ARE DUE no later than 3:00 p.m. E.T on January 28, 2005.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research is soliciting white papers and proposals in the topic areas described below within the Expeditionary Unit Water Purification (EUWP) System Enhancement Program and the Human System Research and Technology (HSRT) Development Program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 

The ONR’s EUWP Program is seeking innovative solutions to identify and evaluate approaches that may significantly reduce the costs, energetics, and footprint for desalination processes.  Some of the approaches to desalination would also be applicable in water purification for high carbon and nitrogen laden wastes.  These will have ramifications to both NASA and the ONR in developing technology solutions for their respective missions.

The HSRT Program is chartered to provide capabilities and technologies for regenerative closed-loop life-support systems that will be essential to enable human planetary exploration. Efforts are currently focused on missions ranging from a return to the Moon and through an initial Mars mission, including using the International Space Station as a test bed for research and technology validation. These future life-support systems must be able to provide additional mass balance closure (to maximize and maintain a high level of pure water recovery) to further reduce logistics requirements, and to promote self-sufficiency.  Some of the requirements include safe operability in micro- and partial-gravity, ambient and reduced-pressure environments, high reliability, minimal use of expendables, ease of maintenance, and low-system volume, mass, and power.  Recovery of useful resources from liquid and solid wastes will be essential.  Innovative, efficient, practical concepts are needed in all areas of resource recovery processes, providing the basic life-support functions of water reclamation.

Topic areas that are considered relevant to this announcement are described below with desired Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) defined as: 
•	TRL 1: Basic principles observed and reported
•	TRL 2: Technology concept and/or application formulated
•	TRL 3: Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof-of-concept
•	TRL 4: Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment
•	TRL 5: Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment

The data is collected for use by the FEMA's Individuals' and Household Program (IHP) as well as other agencies involved in disaster relief such as the Small Business Administration (SBA).  The database must be capable of providing prices for line items for both real estate and personal property for any geographical area in which FEMA of other agencies are tasked to provide disaster assistance.   These disasters may be declared in any U.S. State, Trust Territory, or other U.S. possession.  The disaster housing line item set will be the same for all regions, but the Contractor will need to remain aware of varying local code requirements and building techniques in order to provide FEMA with more accurate pricing data.

The solicitation will only be provided electronically through FedBizOpps web page as discussed below. Interested parties may obtain a copy of the solicitation by accessing the following web page: http://www.eps.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases announces the availability of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) which describes in general terms a research topic and outlines proposal preparation requirements.  The purpose is to solicit proposals for small, pilot, and feasibility clinical trials and to encourage the adequate testing of novel and innovative potential therapies for osteoporosis.  Projects supported would be early phase human trials to test basic safety and efficacy of treatments that would not be otherwise developed and pursued by private industry. The objectives of this initiative are to: 1) Identify and begin clinical testing of potential bone active agents; and 2) Perform initial dosing trials; and 3) select appropriate populations and endpoints for larger scale testing in appropriately powered clinical intervention trials.  To achieve the main goal of this BAA, the NIAMS seeks to support small, pilot and feasibility trials.  The trials should be designed so that the preliminary data obtained would be sufficient to design the next phase (for example, Phase II/III), for which the investigators will have to seek separate funding or obtain evidence of efficacy where a large, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is not feasible.

It is anticipated that two to three cost reimbursement contract awards will be made for a period of three years beginning on or about September 30, 2005.  This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 541710.  The solicitation will be available electronically on or about January 14, 2005.   RFP NIH-NIAMS-BAA-05-02 will be available at the FedBizOpps Website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov and at the NIAMS Website: http://www.niams.nih.gov/rtac/funding/grants/rfp/wwwrfp.htm.  Proposals will be due on or about March 25, 2005. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments and for routinely checking the Internet site for any possible solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government.  All responsible sources may submit proposals which will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate solely with the Isogon Corporation, 330 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10001, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) “Soliciting from a Single Source” to purchase upgrades to software already installed and in use at SSA Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Blvd, Baltimore, MD 21235, and corresponding upgrades to maintenance on that Government owned TICTOC software.  The additional capacity shall be installed and placed on maintenance within FY2005 (i.e. before Oct 1, 2005).  The software licensing authority, and concurrent maintenance, is needed to support the projected growth in processing requirements.  SSA mainframes have been running near or at full capacity, and significant increases in volume of activity are anticipated in FY05.  Higher level mainframes have been/will be installed this year to deal with the upsurge in the workload.  A large portion of the boost in demand can be attributed directly to the additional workload resulting from the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act.  Increased capacity is crucial to the continuation of SSA’s mission. SSA must therefore purchase upgrades in order to continue legal usage of the software to be transferred to those mainframes, and will be doing so throughout fiscal year 2005 by way of modifying the existing order as needed.  This is proprietary software and Isogon Corporation is the only known source capable of providing the required license upgrade and maintenance support.  Maintenance support provides the required software fixes, corrections and revisions necessary to ensure a stable processing environment TICTIC is a commercial-off-the shelf application that is used with CICS ASKTIME command. The ASKTIME command is issued by an application program in order to get the current date and time, as supplied by the operating system. Tic Toc is used to intercept these commands and return a virtual date and/or time. The virtual date and/or time are used to set certain transactions, terminals, userids or combination of these. SSA also uses Tic Toc as a date/time simulation testing tool. It is used on a job-by job basis to test the affects of various dates on SSA application programs without any code changes. Isogon Corporation has no resellers authorized to sell TICTOC upgrades and maintenance.  Isogon is the only authorized dealer known to the Government. The Government anticipates acquiring additional capacity through modifications to an existing purchase order.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, under the authority cited above.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit an offer.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all offers received within the response date of the publication will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514

TITLE:  WAVEFORM OPTIMIZATION FOR MULTI-SENSOR MULTI-MODE APPLICATIONS

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 05-01-IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 15 Feb 05; FY 06 by 1 June 05; FY 07 by 1 June 06; FY 08 by 1 June 07 and, FY 09 by 1 June 08. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 30 July 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

WAVEFORM OPTIMIZATION FOR MULTI-SENSOR MULTI-MODE APPLICATIONS.   The objective of this task is to develop radar transmit waveform strategies, and their associated receive processing methods, for single and multi-mode operations for monostatic and multi-static radar applications.  The waveforms should exploit the potential degrees of freedom (DOF) on the platform(s) and consider the electromagnetic environment with which they interact. The goal is to improve air and ground moving target indication (AMTI, GMTI) and imaging by adjusting the transmit waveform using spatial, temporal, frequency and polarization diversity in the radar transmitter and across available distributed sensors.  Feedback from the receive platform(s) should also be considered to adjust the waveform(s) for the next pulse repetition interval.  A waveform optimization process must be developed to determine what waveform is transmitted so that it exploits its expected electromagnetic interaction with the surrounding clutter, i.e. multi-path scattering.  Illumination from one to multiple sensors, either cooperatively or non-cooperatively, should be considered.  The sensors would be potentially distributed therefore yielding a geometrically diverse aspect, however spatial diversity on a single platform should also be exploited, i.e. independent control of a phased array’s sub-apertures.    Also to be considered are the use of multiple receive platforms that can operate either passively or actively.  Coherent processing is essential and techniques of coherently combining multiple receive sensors signals for improved mission performance must be developed.  Multi-mode operation from a distributed collection of sensors (multi-statics) is also of interest for simultaneous combinations of AMTI, GMTI, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) modes.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $4.9M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 05 - $900K; FY 06 - $1M; FY 07 - $1M; FY 08 - $1M; and FY09 - $1M.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between $25,000 to $250,000 per year.  Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Innovativeness of the Proposed Approach and/or Techniques – How innovative is the approach compared to the current state-of-the art in this particular area, (2) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit – Addresses a current problem effecting a desired technology with a logical approach, (3) Past Performance/Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology, domain knowledge, and a capable and qualified staff,  (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). Consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.   

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

At this time most of the work that will be conducted under this BAA will be unclassified.  But depending on the work proposed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror’s will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

All questions prior to the submission of a technical and cost proposal can be addressed to the technical POCs, Dr. Peter Zulch, 315-330-7861, Peter.Zulch@rl.af.mil or Howard Mitch Beyer, 315-330-1476, Howard.Beyer@rl.af.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Esther E Christianson, Contract Specialist,  619-553-4333; Joye Socha, Contract Officer, 619-553-7515
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, (SPAWARSYSCEN) San Diego, in support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Director of Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E), is seeking proposals for the Information Systems Technology Test (ISTT) Focus Area for the Test and Evaluation / Science and Technology (T&E/S&T) Program. A two-step process is established for offerors contemplating submission of a proposal under this BAA. Proposals may be for projects or investigations that can be completed within a year of award, or for multiple year projects as long as each subsequent phase can be funded as individual options with clearly defined milestones and deliverables. DOT&E strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration previous and current relevant work, and significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations. The ISTT focus area emphasizes the development of advanced test technologies to enable non-intrusive testing and evaluation of future warfighting information systems in complex network-centric environments.  The major components of information systems technology (IST) being addressed by the ISTT focus area are: · Communications Networks · Composable Data Sources and Network Interactions · Information Assurance · Decision Making o Applications o Collaboration o Human-Computer Interfaces. The ISTT program has  specific interest in, but is not limited to, the following technical areas: 1.  Interoperability of network devices in large, complex network architectures. Methods and instruments are needed to evaluate the end-to-end connectivity, interoperability, and capability of secure and non-secure systems-of-systems information networks. Test technologies should assist in assessing the ability to provide services to and accept services from other systems, units, or forces; and to use those services to operate effectively together.  Network performance is affected by applications-generated traffic, which in most cases, can be measured and evaluated. These results are difficult to scale in large military networks when ten's or hundred's of participants are engaged in distributive, collaborative planning. Methods and tools are needed to effectively and realistically scale up and synthesize the participants of large military networks and evaluate the impact of  simultaneous multiplayer activities on the network. 2.  Composable data sources and network interactions. Warfighters operating in a Network-centric environment will be able to compose the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) elements at their disposal. This composable environment enables discovery and utilization of web-based services and sources of data as well as to plug-and-play new hardware and software. Composability will permit creation of new functional capabilities that meet emergent warfighting requirements.  The supporting networks will be seamless, secure, self-organizing, and self-healing. As these networks recompose, network scalability becomes an issue. Non-intrusive methods and tools are needed to evaluate the performance of composable networks including scalability, self-organization, and self-healing. 3.  Effectiveness of information assurance. Information Assurance (IA) protects computer networks, information, and information systems, ensuring availability, integrity, authentication, and confidentiality. Evaluation of IA products and systems requires techniques to generate realistic data that is representative of DoD networks. This includes operation under nominal conditions, crisis induced congestion, and the influence of realistic attacks.  Technologies are needed to assess the effectiveness of information assurance capabilities on large system-of-systems and composable networks. 4.  Decision-making systems, including the actions of intelligent agents. a.  Evaluations of systems in the decision making process. Such evaluations can rarely be performed with the granularity necessary to determine the value of individual components and the information that they contribute to the decision process. This is particularly true of automation intended to support higher-level decision-making that doesn't have a strong repetitive nature. The current state of the practice for evaluating decision support technology is to use techniques that originated in the behavioral sciences. This approach allows the human-computer team to be evaluated using a new technology and their performance compared to teams that do not use the technology under consideration. This is an expensive and tedious process and can rarely be used to evaluate all of the components of a complicated system. Methods to instrument and measure the individual contributions of a system are needed to allow more specific results to be obtained.    b.  Testing the functions of command and control and decision support systems including the actions of intelligent agents.   Thorough testing of command and control and decision support systems prior to release to Warfighters is a critical aspect of high-quality system design. The inability to accomplish this task may lead to the dangerous, and potentially fatal, condition of Warfighters relying on systems whose outputs may have a significant amount of uncertainty.  Thorough testing is difficult because tools necessary to facilitate such testing are not well developed.  This problem is compounded with the requirement to test intelligent agents, whose ability to "learn" makes it difficult to predict their future performance.  Technologies are needed to assess the effectiveness of command and control and decision support systems including the actions of intelligent agent capabilities in large system-of-systems networks.  Additional background information can be viewed at the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central (SPAWAR E-CC). The URL for this site is <https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil> (note that this does not include a "www" prefix) under the BAA number.  Proposed efforts should offer the potential for a significant impact on the current technology and have bearing on issues confronting our Defense and National Security. BAA INFORMATION This announcement will be open through 04 February 2005.  The Government reserves the right to award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions. Proposed efforts should be phased in 12-month segments with specific capability goals to be achieved at the end of each segment. Funding of approximately $1.0M total is expected, but not guaranteed, for awards in FY05. Multiple awards are possible and the funding level is anticipated to increase modestly in the out years. Offerors should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding level or level of effort. A two-step process is established for offerors contemplating submission of a proposal under this BAA.  The process will begin with the submission of a 6-page (single-sided) abstract.  Specific instructions relating to submission and content of the abstract can be viewed at the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central (SPAWAR E-CC). The URL for this site is <https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil> (note that this does not include a "www" prefix) under the BAA number.  These abstracts will be evaluated using a reduced set consisting of criteria 1 through 4, which are of equal value, of the criteria listed below.   Based on this evaluation, the Government will notify offerors as to possible interest in their proposals and request full proposals be submitted.  A debrief will not be available for abstracts submitted.  Each proposal will then be evaluated using the full set of criteria, which are of equal value, listed below: 1. Overall scientific or technical merit of the proposal, 2. Effort is an advanced science or technology development that satisfies a militarily relevant test and evaluation need, 3. Potential for technical success, 4. Potential for transition to a Department of Defense test capability, 5. Value of the project to the T&E/S&T program, 6. The offeror's capabilities, plan of execution, and facilities, 7. Realism of the proposed cost. All program participants will be expected to share technical information, subject to non-disclosure requirements, with all other T&E/S&T program participants. Offerors are advised that certain individuals from Scientific Research Corporation, CNS Technologies, Inc and Newtech may assist the Government as subject matter experts (SME) in performing evaluations of the abstracts and proposals submitted under this announcement.  These SMEs will be authorized to access portions of the proposal data and engage in discussions that are necessary to enable them to provide specific advice on specialized matters or on particular problems.  The SMEs will not rank offerors' proposals.  Any objection to disclose information to these SMEs should be provided in writing BEFORE the date set for receipt of proposals and shall include a detailed statement for the basis of the objection.  Any objection to disclosure could affect the results of the evaluation. Administrative questions for both abstracts and proposals may be addressed to Ms. Esther E. Christianson at (619) 553-4333 or e-mail at esther.christianson@navy.mil or mailed to SPAWARSYSCEN, Attn: Esther E. Christianson, Code 2212, 53560 Hull St., San Diego, CA 92152-5001. Technical questions may be submitted, by email only, to Mr. Robert Kolesar, e-mail Robert.kolesar@navy.mil with a copy to Esther Christianson. The answer to the two most frequently asked questions, "Is this of interest?" or "Is this within scope of the BAA?" will be answered by, "An abstract must be submitted in order to answer your question." The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the abstracts/proposals received in response to this announcement. The Government may also only select specific tasks within a proposal for award. This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). The BAA Attachment provides submittal instructions and other information. A formal request for proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued. Interested parties are invited to respond to this synopsis. The Government will consider all submissions from responsible parties.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services is conducting a Sources Sought /Market Analysis to locate Small Businesses, HUBZone, and/or 8(a) firms under NAICS Code 541990 capable of conducting workshops on the Methods for Routine Documentation of Medical Device use. The Small Business Size Standard for NAICS Code 541990 is less than $ 6 million in annual receipts.
Background:
One of the missions of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is to monitor the safety of marketed medical devices.  The current monitoring systems in place rely on adverse event reporting.  Several studies have shown significant rates of underreporting.   New monitoring systems that could be developed include routine searches of various data sources such as hospital discharge codes, electronic hospital records, or emergency room records.  Unfortunately, studies currently underway show that attempts to create such systems will all fail to capture rates of adverse device events because device-specific medical information is not routinely documented in medical records.  In other words, both device use and problems related to device use are not adequately recorded in patient charts.  For most of the instances when device use and device-related problems are recorded, information about the specific device and the nature of the problem is inadequate.  
Good documentation of both device use and device problems is necessary for scientifically investigating the safety of devices.  For patient safety reporting of adverse device events, it is essential that information on device utilization be routinely documented.  For improving patient safety, reports of adverse device events may be lead to analysis of the use of all or a sample of a particular device to obtain information about the likelihood of such events and may lead to patient follow-up by providers of their patients using such devices.  In these cases, having unique device identification in the patients’ medical records, and pointers to a data base for information about that specific device is necessary.  
There are many barriers to good routine documentation: lack of awareness of the need to document, lack of financial incentive, lack of knowledge of how to describe particular devices, and lack of time for documentation.  Since the barriers are multi-factorial, a multifaceted solution to the problem of poor documentation will probably be required.  Simple exhortations to busy providers to write down more information are unlikely to be effective.  An example of new solutions to be considered includes the development of “smart” technology as an effective and inexpensive way to set up automatic documentation of device use, especially in adverse event situations.
One way to examine and facilitate potential solutions to the issue of medical device identification and routine documentation is to bring experts from the relevant fields together to discuss the problem and recommend actions.  A separate effort is underway to improve the nomenclature and identification of devices.  This current effort regards routine documentation.  Because of the possibility that one or two dominant personalities could steer the course of a workshop, two workshops will be held to increase the range of ideas that are expressed by the participants.  Participants will be chosen from the fields of drug epidemiology, health services research, health care insurance, information technology, clinical data standards and technology, human factors engineering, social science, medical device manufacture, medical device regulation, and high technology development and engineering.  Sectors to be represented include non-FDA federal government, professional societies, consumer groups, academia, health care providers, health care payers, third party health research contractors, information technology firms, and technology development entrepreneurs.  The workshops will need to be facilitated by people with a broad understanding of medical devices.  Each workshop should have a relatively small number of participants to encourage conversation.
Project Purpose: 
The purpose of this project is to work with people and organizations who are interested in furthering device documentation, patient safety, and the exchange of device information, and who understand health care delivery and are developing new technologies.  We want to stimulate and record their ideas regarding the encouragement and enabling of routine documentation of medical device use.  The best vehicle for this work is through targeted workshops.
Scope of Work:
Provide professional services to organize, recruit non-CDRH participants, host, facilitate, and document two workshops to brainstorm and obtain feedback on ways to encourage and develop routine documentation of medical device use and medical device related problems. These workshops would be held with CDRH and invited members of industry, government and academia.
Tasks for each of two workshops:
(1)	The length of each workshop will be one and one-half days.  The dates will be determined by the contractor in consultation with the Project Officer.  Each workshop will include approximately 10 to 15 invitees from outside CDRH and up to 6 from inside CDRH.  The non-CDRH invitees will be different at each workshop.  The distribution of background profiles of the invitees will be approximately similar for each of the workshops.  The background profiles will be distributed among three dimensions in a way that maximizes the diversity of the participants.  The first dimension is field: drug epidemiology, health services research, health care insurance, information technology, clinical data standards and technology, human factors engineering, social science, medical device manufacture, medical device regulation, and high technology development and engineering.  The second dimension is economic sector: non-FDA federal government (including health care providers and health care payers), non-profit private organizations (including professional societies, consumer groups, health care providers, and academia), and for-profit private organizations (including academia, health care providers, health care payers, third party health research contractors, information technology firms, and technology development entrepreneurs).  The third dimension is academic degree: bachelor, master, and doctoral.  The fourth dimension is years of relevant work experience: less than 5, 5 to 19, and 20 or more.  All invitees should exhibit evidence of being highly creative. (2) Working with the Project Officer, the contractor will identify invitees, issue invitations, offer travel advice, and, as appropriate, offer honoraria to cover reasonable travel expenses and induce attendance.  Some invitees will not require an honorarium.  The contractor will need to judge the appropriate level of honorarium to offer each invitee. (3) At least two weeks prior to the workshop, participants of the workshop will be sent background material to review.  The material will describe the current state of routine documentation of device use and device related problems, explain the need for improvement, include a preliminary agenda, and provide travel information.  One copy of the background materials will be provided to the contractor by the Project Officer. (4) The contractor will set up an appropriate meeting space large enough to comfortably accommodate all participants for formal presentations and group discussion.  The meeting space must be in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area and within 3 city blocks of a Metro stop.  If the proposed meeting space is further from a Metro stop, the contractor will provide transportation from a Metro stop. (5) The contractor will provide, set up, and troubleshoot the required audiovisual equipment (at least two microphones and a Windows-based laptop-projector combination) and printed agendas. (6) Each workshop will begin in the morning with prepared presentations covering the background materials.  In the first afternoon, the contractor will facilitate 2 simultaneous brainstorming groups, each in separate rooms, to address specific questions.  The specific questions will have been developed in advance by the Project Officer and the contractor.  In the evening, the contractor will prepare synopses of the brainstorm results.  The second morning will begin with contractor presentation of the brainstorm results, and conclude with discussion by all the attendees. (7) Since work will continue through both morning breaks, afternoon break, and lunch on the first day, meals and break refreshments will be provided by the contractor.  The contractor will accommodate special dietary needs. (8) The contractor will deliver a transcript (PDF format) and report (PDF and Microsoft Word formats) of each workshop to the Project Officer within one month of the workshop.  The report will include the findings, proposed ideas, and decisions, if any.  The contractor will have the option of including their own recommendations.  
The contractor will send to each participant and post on its website an FDA-approved PDF-format electronic report of the two workshops.  Any further publication will be jointly agreed to by the Project Officer and contractor.
Interested Small, HUBzone, and 8(a) businesses should respond by submitting complete information about their capability to perform this work.  Organizations must demonstrate their capability to administer and coordinate interrelated tasks in an effective and timely manner.  Documentation may include Government and Commercial contracts, references (with names, telephone numbers, and email addresses) and any other information serving to document the organization’s capability.  Only written responses will be accepted. The Government anticipates award of a purchase order consisting of a twelve month period.  This is not a request for quote and does not commit the Government to award of a purchase order now or in the future.  The purpose of this sources sought/market analysis is to gather data required to determine if there are sufficient numbers of interested and qualified Small , HUBzone, or 8(a) businesses to justify setting aside this acquisition exclusively for Small, HUBzone or 8(a) business participation.  Once a determination is made, a pre-solicitation synopsis will be released.  Your written submission must be received in the office by 3:00 PM, est., Wednesday, January 5, 2005, by email, fax, or U.S Postal Service mail at the following address: Food and Drug Administration, Office of Acquisition and Grants Services, Attn: Kim L.

<DESC>Indian Health Service (IHS) demonstration of Behavioral Health treatment planning systems.

INTRODUCTION
The Indian Health Service (IHS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for providing federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The IHS is the principal federal health care provider and health advocate for Indian people and its goal is to raise their health status to the highest possible level. The IHS currently provides health services to approximately 1.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who belong to more than 557 federally recognized tribes in 35 states.  IHS services are provided directly and through tribally contracted and operated health programs. The Federal system consists of 36 hospitals, 61 health centers, 49 health stations, and 5 residential treatment centers. In addition, 34 urban Indian health projects provide a variety of health and referral services.

In addition to primary and preventive care, IHS also provides behavioral health care via numerous IHS direct, Tribal and Urban (I/T/U) behavioral health programs.  These programs include hospital and clinic-based mental health, alcohol/substance abuse, and social work programs as well as stand alone behavioral health programs.  Residential treatment centers for youth and adults also provide in-patient alcohol and substance abuse treatment and aftercare. Many of these programs are JCAHO, CARF or AAAHC accredited.  The majority of behavioral health providers are licensed or certified professions including psychiatrist, psychologists, social workers, mental health specialists and alcohol and substance abuse counselors. 

 BACKGROUND
The purpose of this document is to describe the attributes and functionality required in an integrated treatment plan module for use within the existing Resource and Patient Management (RPMS) behavioral health applications. RPMS is a MUMPS-based, integrated solution for the management of clinical and administrative information in healthcare facilities of various sizes and orientations. Flexible hardware configurations, over 35 software applications, and network communication components combine to provide a comprehensive clinical, financial, and administrative solution.

Any treatment plan tool selected or developed must be culturally appropriate and able to address the special considerations of the I/T/U provider and patient population. It must be based on standards of care and best practices and meet JCAHO, CARF, AAAHC or other behavioral health accreditation requirements. Additionally, treatment planning tools must adhere to Graphical User Interface (GUI) usability standards and be usable by paraprofessional and professional mental health, alcohol/substance abuse and social work providers in outpatient and residential settings.

Desired attributes and functional requirements include: 

„Ï	Diagnosis or symptom-driven protocols
„Ï	Dual diagnosis protocols
„Ï	Adult, children and youth protocols
„Ï	Clinical decision support using BH industry best  practices:
o	Identified symptoms suggest DSM-IV diagnosis codes
o	Standard and user-defined assessment instruments
o	Problem-based treatment planning with a clinical library of problem, objective, and intervention statements that can be modified to meet specific organizational requirements (customizable)
„Ï	Progress note documentation linked to the treatment plan
„Ï	Discharge summary and clinical follow-up (Aftercare/Continuity of Care)
„Ï	Outcome measures 
„Ï	Wellness approach
„Ï	Extensive date and review tracking and reporting, including:
o	Plan Activation, Review, and Completion dates
o	Objective Start and End dates
o	Intervention Start, End and Target Resolution dates
„Ï	Opportunity for input by patient and other members of the treatment team
„Ï	Language that is meaningful to patient 
„Ï	Multiple signature lines 
„Ï	Electronic and printed formats
„Ï	Developed using GUI industry standards
„Ï	Easy to learn
„Ï	Usable by BH professionals and paraprofessionals
„Ï	Ability to Store and Retrieve disposition information as part of a patient¡¦s treatment plan
„Ï	Ability to auto-populate portions of the treatment plan by POV (Dx) 
„Ï	Ability to auto-populate portions of the treatment plan with Biopsychosocial Assessment data
„Ï	Multiple patient- and provider-specific reports
„Ï	Fully customizable

PURPOSE OF DEMONSTRATION
To assist in the evaluation and determination of the applicability and appropriateness of commercial treatment plan applications in the I/T/U behavioral health clinical and technical environment. 

The interactive demonstration, led by a behavioral health (BH) clinician, can be conducted remotely or on-site at the vendor¡¦s expense. The purpose for the demonstration is to provide I/T/U BH clinicians and subject matter experts with hands-on, scenario-based examples of the products¡¦ capabilities.  In addition to working through various clinical scenarios vendors should be able to discuss integration into a MUMPS-based environment. As part of the demonstration vendors should be prepared to provide a list of clients currently using their product along with a point of contact at each location.

<SUBJECT>63--Sources Sought for production of the Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (MDARS)
<SOLNBR>W909MY05RMDAR
<RESPDATE>013105
<ARCHDATE>04012005
<CONTACT>Sherry Savage, (703)325-6066
<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The purpose of this announcement is to request identification of potential sources from industry for production of the Armys Mobile Detection Assessment Response System (MDARS).  MDARS consists of the MDARS  Control Station (MCS), robotic vehicles with a Mission Payload Suite (MPS) and Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), and Associated Items of Support Equipment (ASIOE).  The MDARS procurement will be managed by the materiel developer, the Office o f the Product Manager, Force Protection Systems (PM-FPS), at Fort Belvoir, VA.  The U.S. Army Military Police School (USAMPS) is the combat developer.  The MDARS is designed to operate in environments such as materiel storage yards, arsenals, petroleum sto rage areas, airfields, rail yards, and port facilities.  Future versions of the MDARS will operate in conjunction with fixed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).  The major components of the MDARS are the MCS, the (MDARS) robotic vehicles with MPS and DGPS, and ASIOE.  High dollar value and critical US assets in external storage sites may be vulnerable to an intruder or saboteur intending to deprive the US of these assets.  The objective of MDARS is to protect these assets by providing commanders with a highl y secure, standardized, semi-autonomous IDS using robotics technology.  MDARS will introduce robotic vehicles employing a suite of sensors that is controlled by a control station that houses monitoring and annunciation equipment. MDARS will satisfy an imme diate Army requirement for a semi-autonomous mobile capability for patrolling physical security sites at Department of Defense (DoD) installations.  Without operator intervention other than system initiation, the robotic vehicle will automatically move ran domly to and throughout designated patrol areas in designated environments primarily during non-duty hours.  While on random patrol, the robotic vehicle will semi-autonomously conduct surveillance, check for intruders, conduct product inventory, and check the status of facility barriers, such as gate and bunker/container doors.  Operator input from the control station will be required only if an intruder is detected or the robotic vehicle encounters a situation it is not programmed to handle.  If the MDARS robotic vehicle detects an intruder, the video link to the control station will be activated and an audio/visual alarm will be annunciated at the control station.  The security officer will be able to see, hear, and talk to the intruder as well as send the  robotic vehicle to a location where the intruder might be hiding.  The robotic vehicles:  (1) detect intruders, (2) read the status of locks on storage structures (open, closed or error), and (3) determine the status of inventory through the use of specia lized Radio Frequency Identification transponder tags.  MDARS also will interface with RF/Microwave and Hardwire/Fiber Optic communication networks.  Functional users of MDARS are supply and maintenance activities of the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC) an d the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  Approximately 8 depots are currently planned for operational deployment of MDARS, although more are expected to be added in the future.  MDARS will be operated by Department of Defense (DoD) security and law enforceme nt units.  To date MDARS has undergone Program Definition and Risk Reduction, which resulted in development of brassboard models, and System Development and Demonstration (SDD), which is verifying producibility of the MDARS system and will be completed in 2005.  The production and fielding phase is expected to begin in 2006.  The MDARS production robotic vehicle will be equipped with features such as collision avoidance, intruder detection and assessment, barrier assessment, and product inventory subsystems .  The robotic vehicle will respond to and communicate with the MDARS control station that uses the Government-developed Multiple Resource Host Architecture (MR HA) command and control software.  Associated support equipment for the MDARS includes (a) Remote Product and Barrier Assessment Items, (b) Communications Relay/Repeaters, (c) Navigation Aids, and (d) Hand-held control units.  Initially, logistics support and maintenance for MDARS will be provided by the production contractor or separate contractual agreements at the installation level.  The contract for the Production phase will be Fixed Price with Indefinite Delivery ordering provisions.  The Production p hase will be up to five years in duration.  The maximum value of the Production phase is 10 systems/sites.  Total contract life will not exceed 5 years.  The source selection will be Best Value and will use a Tradeoff process. In preparation for the release of the MDARS Request for Proposal (RFP), the Government is seeking sources from industry to produce and install the MDARS for the acquisition discussed in this announcement.  The MDARS Draft Specification, SOW, and Sources So ught questionnaire are downloadable and posted on the CECOM Acquisition Center (CAC) Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) at http://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  The documents are identified on the IBOP as a Market Survey entitled MDARS, W909MY-05- R-MDAR, Pre-Solicitation.  Responses to this announcement should be submitted to the identified Contract Specialist (Sherry Savage).    Responses to the Sources Sought questionnaire should be submitted via email to Sherry.Savage@CACW.army.mil, and are due  on 31 Jan 05.  Numbered Notes 25 and 26 on the FedBizzOpps website apply (http://www2.eps.gov?Numbered_Notes.html).  Responses can also be submitted in hard copy, video, or CD format and should be sent to Sherry Savage at the contracting office address li sted in this announcement.

<SUBJECT>--Blanket Purchase Agreement for emergency repairs.
<DESC>The Fort Richardson Regional Contracting Office, Fort Richardson, Alaska intends to enter into a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with Honeywell under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Servic es Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This BPA will be for emergency maintenance and repair of heating, hot water, ventilation air condition, piping, mechanical, and electrical and control systems which support proprietary boilers installed by Honeywell un der Energy Savings Performance Contract DACA87-97-D-0064 (ESPC).  An emergency defined as a condition or situation that poses imminent danger to property and/or personnel in an arctic environment in the event that the repair does not take place timely.  Ho neywell will already be onsite when the emergency condition is discovered in the course of performing other repairs to systems covered by the ESPC.  Although this intent cites FAR 6.302-1, 1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services wil l satisfy agency requirements, the events that would trigger the issuance of an individual purchase order for repair under the BPA would represent a compelling urgency in that the complete shut down of a building and loss of the functional capability of eq uipment and other assets in an arctic climate could occur if the repairs are not made immediately.  This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and is not a request for competitive quotes.  It is suggested that small business firms  or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.  The point of contact for this action is marian.taylor@richardson.army.mil or Marian Taylor at (907) 384-7105.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

6		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

			This $35,000 Definitional Mission will evaluate the terms, feasibility, and impact of telecommunications projects proposed by the Government of Peru.  The proposed technical assistance projects would contribute to improved competition in the Peruvian telecom market and foster the adoption of new telecom technologies.  The project proposals were presented by two potential grantees in the Government of Peru: the Supervisory Authority of Private Investment in Telecommunications (OSIPTEL) and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MTC).  OSIPTEL (the Spanish-language acronym for Organismo Supervisor de Inversión Privada en Telecomunicaciones) proposed six areas of technical assistance to build on the recently completed USTDA-funded Telecom Capacity Building Technical Assistance Project (USTDA Activity No. 2003-50016A) and to support their trade capacity building (TCB) efforts related to the U.S.-Andean Free Trade Agreement (FTA).  The DM Consultant will take advantage of the travel to Peru to explore possible technical assistance projects with the MTC in support of Peru’s National Telecommunications Plan.

OSIPTEL Projects:
1)	Resale of Public Telecom Services:  The objective is to develop a model to determine the value of the discount rate for the resale of public telecom services and telephone traffic volume.  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance has yet to be determined.

2)	Sharing Infrastructure for the Provision of Public Telecom Services:  The objective is to encourage the efficient utilization of existing telecom infrastructure given the high cost of operators developing their own telecom infrastructure. The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance has yet to be determined.

3)	New Telecom Service Platforms:  The objective is to encourage the adoption of new telecom service platforms such as next generation networks and IP telephony.  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance has yet to be determined.

4)	Broadband Services:  The objective is to promote competition in the broadband market, which is currently dominated by one service provider.  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance has yet to be determined.  

5)	National Telecom Services Statistics Database:  The objective is to develop a harmonized database of critical telecom service statistics (such as price and volume) in order to develop uniform information and promote transparency in the telecom sector.  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance has yet to be determined.

6)	Strengthening of Competition Policy in the Telecom Sector:  The objective is to train OSIPTEL officials on the aspects of competition policy, as well as to encourage cooperation on competition issues across the spectrum of stakeholders (GOP, private sector, media, consumers, and the public in general).  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance has yet to be determined.

It is anticipated that the DM Consultant will be able to combine any recommended technical assistance projects with OSIPTEL into a single grant activity.

The DM Consultant will also work with MTC to assess potential USTDA assistance to support Peru’s National Telecommunications Plan.

MTC Project: 
7)	National Telecommunications Plan:  The objective is to support the implementation of the National Telecommunications Plan, which sets goals for improved service, competition, and development of rural telecommunications.  The estimated cost of the proposed technical assistance has yet to be determined.
