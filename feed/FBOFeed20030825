<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Li Cor, Inc., 4421 Superior Street, Lincoln, NE  68504.  The proposed contract is for a Portable Photosynthesis System, Model #LI-6400R.  The capabilities that make the LI-6400R desirable for our ongoing research concerning the symbiotic associations of endophytic fungi and an array of plant species are:  The ability to obtain simultaneous measurements of CO2 and H2O, thereby determining the rate of respiration.  The CO2 and H2O analyzers are located in a sensory head, allowing measurements to be made more precisely and efficiently than any competing product.  The LI-6400R includes an integrated Leaf Chamber Fluorometer, allowing simultaneous measurement of gas exchange and fluorescence over the same leaf area, and also includes two light sources which allows us to do dynamic photosynthesis and CO2 analyses.  No other instrument is known to possess this feature.  The ability to precisely control the experimental parameters, including temperature, pressure, air flow and light.  This allows more precise measurement than could otherwise be obtained, as well as allowing meaningful comparison of measurements obtained at different times and locations.  Much of our ongoing research involves Arabidopsis.  Li Cor manufactures a chamber for the LI-6400R specifically designed to optimally measure photosynthesis, fluorescence and respiration in Arabidopsis and plants of similar size.  Use of this chamber greatly increases the accuracy and efficiency of measurements.  These unique features allow many more measurements to be obtained in a given period of time, than could be obtained with any other known equipment.  This will result in significant economic savings to the U.S. Geological Survey.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government; no additional synopsis will be published.

<DESC>13.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK (Physical characteristics).  This will be a Performance Based Fixed Price Contract for Indian Health Service.  Work to be performed consists of furnishing all labor, transportation, materials, equipment, and supervision for the Roof and Equipment Replacement at Santa Rosa Clinic and Sells Transient Quarters.  The proposed contract listed herein is Set-Aside under the Buy Indian Act for firms that are at a minimum 51 percent Indian owned, controlled and operated.  In accordance with the Public Health Service Acquisition Regulation Paragraph 380.503(E), not more than 50 percent of the work to be performed under a prime contract awarded pursuant to the Buy Indian Act shall be contracted to other than Indian firms.  For this purpose, work to be performed does not include the provision of materials, supplies, or equipment.  In order for Indian firms to prove they meet the qualifications requirement of the Buy Indian Set-Aside restriction, they need to submit a “Certification of Tribal Affiliation and Degree of Indian Blood” with their offer. Offerors who are not currently certified by IHS or BIA are required to submit proof of ownership and eligibility for Indian preference under the “Buy Indian Act.”  Contractors shall ensure that bonding capability for a project of this magnitude is available.  Joint Ventures will be considered as long as the Indian firm is the managing entity.  A copy of the Joint Venture Agreement shall accompany the offer.  Estimated dollar magnitude is $100,000 to $500,000.  METHOD OF SELECTION:  Technical Evaluation Factors/Past Performance:  Past performance selection procedures will be used.  For this reason, the Technical Evaluation Factors/Past Performance and the Cost Price shall be furnished separately.  Technical evaluation factors/qualifications submitted by each firm will be reviewed and will be ranked numerically and evaluated for the most highly qualified firm using the factors and point values as shown.  Firms shall fully address their capability and qualifications with regard to each of the following evaluation factors.  The top ranked firm will be evaluated and recommended solely on their written responses to the solicitation.  Oral interviews may be held at the option of the Government.  Prime Contractors assembling a team are cautioned that that the evaluation will be based on the team, not just the prime firm.  The Offeror must demonstrate its experience and professional ability in the following areas:  (1) EXPERIENCE AS A PRIME CONTRACTOR WITH PROJECTS OF SIMILAR SIZE, SCOPE, AND COMPLEXITY:  Prime’s past experience with healthcare, healthcare campus infrastructure, support space, and quarter’s construction and renovation and specifically roofing and HVAC replacement. (20 points);  (2) PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE OF THE PROPOSED STAFF FOR THIS PROJECT: Professional qualifications and licenses of prime, project managers, superintendents, estimator, quality control, and construction inspectors.  Technical competence and skills as they relate to healthcare, support space, and quarter’s construction and renovation and specifically roofing and HVAC replacement. (17 points); (3) PAST PERFORMANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY CONTRACTS OF SIMILAR SIZE, SCOPE, AND COMPLEXITY: Presented proof of abilities, project management, quality control, federal contracting requirements, scheduling, initial bid compared to final project costs, timeliness, and the demonstrated responsiveness to the needs and requirements of the customer. (13 points); and (4) PAST PERFORMANCE WITH SAFETY AND QUALITY CONTROL:  Description of specific safety and quality control initiatives for this and previous projects. (10 points).  Upon establishment of a list of firms whose technical proposals are technically acceptable, their respective cost proposals will be opened and evaluated.  For purposes of evaluation of offerors, the technical factors when combined are as important as the price.  PRICE EVALUATION FACTORS (40 points):  Offerors are advised that an award may be made without discussion, exchanges or any contact concerning the proposals received; therefore, offerors should present their best and final price at the time of submission.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  Proposals will be evaluated on lump sum bid price for the base item and evaluation of price on any options that is most advantageous to the Government.  Award of any options items may be made by modification to the contract and, if exercised, would be awarded when funds become available during the term of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award a contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  The final selection will be determined based on both the technical proposal and the cost proposal submitted.  Specifications, plans and offering documents will be available on/about September 9, 2003, for a NON-REFUNDABLE PRICE OF $25.00 per set by writing Barry J. Prince at the address above.  Company checks, personal checks and credit cards are not acceptable and will be returned.  Cashier checks and money orders must be made payable to Indian Health Service and should be sent to Barry J. Prince.  You should allow several business days for processing your requests. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by the agency.  Offer due date is on/about October 9, 2003, at 2:00 pm.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for 1 Battery Test System.  STATEMENT OF WORK: PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION FOR B354 BATTERY TEST SYSTEM 1.1      OVERALL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS This battery test system must be composed of a PC-type (Windows based) computer, a user data/control/interface program, and multi-channel, microprocessor-based, modular hardware; and be capable of collecting voltage, current, and temperature data on a battery for a particular test channel.  A test channel is defined here as a positional port where the battery being tested is installed, and battery data (current/temperature/voltage) is collected in response to software-controlled test scenarios (profiles such as charge/discharge/rest/heat/cool). This test system must consist of 12 independent channels.  Each channel is to be software configured, capable of providing a maximum charge/discharge current of +/- 10 Amp and a current range adjustable for constant-current mode to within + 0.05% accuracy of full scale tolerance (High 10A, Medium 1A, Low 100mA).	Each channel should also have a 0 to +5 Vdc voltage range (with the ability to perform a deep discharge down to 0VDC) adjustable for constant-voltage mode to within + 0.05% accuracy of full-scale voltage.  Each channel should have a –20°C to 100°C temperature range with a ±1.5% accuracy of the full-scale temperature.  The + 0.05% accuracy for current and voltage should last a minimum of six months before calibration is required.  The + 1.5% accuracy for temperature should last a minimum of six months before calibration is required.	     1.2  DATA/CONTROL/INTERFACE SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS 1.2.1	   The software must be capable of independently configuring each test channel with different charge/discharge/rest/heat/cool profiles that can be saved and recalled for subsequent test runs. 1.2.2      The software must have the capability to provide complex charge/discharge/rest/heat/cool cycles on per channel basis.  “Complex” cases follow below.   1.2.3    The software must be capable of providing up to ten step (“staircase”) functions as part of a test run profile. 1.2.4	 The software must be capable of contiguously mixing adjustable high sample rate (down to 1 millisecond) test segments with adjustable low sample rate segments (i.e. switch on high sample data acquisition rate on any or all voltage or current test channel parameters during pulse discharge periods). 1.2.5	      The software must be capable of performing discharge and charge current pulsing with a minimum pulse width of 100ms.  During any current pulse the data system needs to acquire a minimum of 10 data samples evenly spaced.   [Note: Positive discrimination may be given towards manufacturers providing the capability for user defined high and low speed settings.] 1.2.6   The software and hardware must have the capability for each channel to perform pulsing independent of each other channel.  All 12 channels need to be able to perform pulsing. 1.2.7    The software must have the capability to configure each test channel’s profile(s) for “stop-test”, based on logical “And” / “Or” criteria of voltage, current, temperature, capacity (Amp-hrs), time and derivative related condition(s) battery parameters. Example (1): “Stop channel test if battery voltage is …., OR  temperature is ….” Example (2): “Stop channel test if capacity is …. AND time is …. hours” 1.2.8	  The software must provide the capability to terminate a particular channel’s test and force an open circuit condition at the battery under test terminals, based on same logical criteria basis as mentioned above (1.2.6). 1.2.9	     The software must provide the capability to terminate a particular channel’s test and force an open circuit condition at the battery under test terminals, as a “manual abort” on the program’s runtime screen. 1.2.10	The software must be capable of recovering test data in case of PC program failure (computer crash) and continue to test upon PC re-boot.  1.2.11       The software must have the capability to graph and simultaneously display the capacity, current, pressure, temperature, voltage, and derivative related acquired data from each test channel while the test is in progress.  1.2.11     The software must provide data analysis tools. 1.2.12	 The software must have the capability to produce hard copy data plots. 1.2.13   The software must be capable of conducting internal resistance battery measurements. 1.2.14     The software must have the capability to export acquired data to Microsoft Excel. 1.2.15	 The software must have the capability to perform system readiness tests. 1.2.16 The software must have the capability to control a thermal chamber.  The interface must allow a desired set point to be chosen as well as a rate of temperature increase and decrease (control the slope of temperature versus time).  In the event of failure, the system must fail safe meaning the chamber will return to ambient temperature.   1.2.17      The software must have the capability to control a thermal chamber in the following manner:  Hold until chamber temperature is met, discharge all cells independently, hold until all cells are completed, change temperature if desired and hold until the chamber temperature is met, charge all cells independently, hold until all cells are completed.  This process may be repeated at least 100 times with the addition of pulsed charge and discharge profiles as needed. 1.3   TEST SYSTEM HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS 1.3.1 The test system hardware must be composed of a micro-controller/micro-processor based battery test stand that will independently handle all control and data storage independent of the PC terminal.  The PC terminal will be used to generate test profiles and collect data as it is released from the battery test stand's buffer.  The battery test stand needs to have the ability to ascertain if the PC is unable to collect data and if so needs to perform a shut down of the test stand.	The shunt down needs to consist of physical hardware isolation of the test stand from the battery's under test. 1.3.2	  The test system hardware needs to have an open circuit impedance of greater than 1Mohms. 1.3.3  The test system needs to have a utility service connection for 208VAC single-phase 60Hz (50A) or 240VAC three phase 60 Hz (50A). 1.3.4  Each test system channel must have test active/inactive status LED(s). 1.3.3	 Test system hardware must have detailed channel calibration procedures (state if the channels support auto-calibration), and easily accessible calibration area. 1.3.4  Test system hardware must have 12 temperature measurement inputs.  The usual temperature range is -20.0 °C to 100.0 °C. [Note: Positive discrimination may be given towards manufacturers providing additional future expansion capability.] 1.3.5      Test system hardware must have a minimum field-upgradeable expansion capability of 12 channels. [Note: Positive discrimination may be given towards manufacturers providing additional future expansion capability.] 1.3.6      Test system hardware must have the capability to properly function with a Cincinnati sub-zero temperature chamber model No. Zh-32-2-2-H/AC Watlow F4 controller utilizing a RS232 communications card module and Mod bus protocol.   1.3.7      The test system must have a minimum of 12 general cylindrical and 12 flat cell holders.   1.4   OPERATIONS REQUIREMENTS 1.4.1   START-UP SUPPORT:   Vendor must provide technical support for software/hardware installation and system start-up. [Note: Positive discrimination may be given towards manufacturers providing free training.] 1.4.2     DOCUMENTATION: Required submittal of two sets of hardware/software operation manual, hardware/software user’s manual, and circuit diagrams/component lists. [Note: Non-disclosure statement may be signed if necessary.] This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<DESC>The mission of the Mine Safety and Health Administration carries out the mandates of the Mine Act at all mining and mineral processing operations in the United States, regardless of size, number of employees or commodities.

As part of this mission, MSHA has need of the ability to measure exposure to potentially harmful levels of respirable coal mine dust.  This will allow the user to determine when engineering controls are functioning to control the levels of respirable dust, when action must be taken to prevent overexposure, and at what point during a working shift unacceptable levels of respirable dust occurred so that the control system can be adjusted to prevent future exposure.

In order to facilitate the gathering of this information, the Directorate of Coal Mine Safety and Health has a need to purchase 10 PDM-1 Personal Dust Monitors, manufactured by Rupprecht & Patashnick, of Albany New York.

Rupprecht & Patashnick (R&P) hold patents on the only existing technology that allows for the continuous determination of respirable coal dust in real time.

The PDM-1 will be purchased on a sole-sources basis with Rupprecht & Patashnick (R&P).  Telephone request will not be accepted. Offerors are not being asked to submit capability statements as part of this announcement.  Any response should be received on or before August 29, 2003.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS) paragraph 3.2.1.3.12, the purpose of this announcement is to inform industry that the FAA intends to contract, in an amount greater than $100,000. THE SOLICITATION TO BE ISSUED BASED ON THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL REPLACE PREVIOUS SOLICITATION DTFACT-03-R-00009, ISSUED ON JUNE 16, 2003, WHICH HAS BEEN CANCELLED IN ITS ENTIRETY.    IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR OFFERORS WHO REPLIED TO THE ORGINAL ANNOUNCEMENT TO REPLY AGAIN.  SOLICITATION BASED ON THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE ISSUED DURING THE WEEK OF AUGUST 25, 2003.      The Federal Aviation Administration, William J. Hughes Technical Center, is seeking to award a competitive contract to provide continuing technical engineering support for the Surface Movement Advisor Free Flight (SMA Free Flight) Program.   Background:   SMA Free Flight is currently deployed in 16 airports throughout the country.  The SMA, used by the airlines, improves airport surface operations by providing Airline Operations Centers (AOCs) and airport ramp control personnel with near real-time aircraft position data and estimated time-to-touchdown information for arrivals in the terminal area.  It is currently anticipated that the SMA system will be expanded to at least 12 additional field sites. The objective of the proposed contract is to perform continued SMA support activities including system software and hardware maintenance updates and engineering.  Because SMA maintenance tends to be of a highly visible nature, and requires direct involvement with the airline industry, it is extremely critical that maintenance support is acquired without impacting scheduled engineering and operational activities.  This maintenance also includes 2nd level field support including a Help-Desk operation to respond to all SMA concerns and issues. Systems currently included in, and/or, affected by the work effort, are as follows: SMA ARTSIIIE (Automated Radar Terminal System) AGW (ARTS Gateway) system      interface SMA STARS (Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System) AIG system     interface SMA ARTSIIIA ODS (Optical Disk Subsystem) interface SMA AMASS TAIU (Airport Movement Area Safety System/Terminal Automation Interface Unit) SMA Atlanta Prototype The period of performance of the contract will be for 5 years, and the Government estimates a total contract ceiling of 97,130 hours.  The contract type to be awarded will be Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Time and Material or Labor Hour Delivery Orders.  This procurement is 100% set-aside for Small Business.  The NAICS code for this requirement will be 541330 (Engineering Services).   Small business size standard is $4.0 million in annual receipts.  Award will be based on Best Value evaluation.  Technical abilities will be considered more important than cost, with the highest emphasis being placed on direct SMA or related systems experience. Companies interested in receiving a solicitation package and submitting a proposal for these services may submit a written request via e-mail or facsimile only.  The request must state the solicitation number, DTFACT-03-R00030, the title, Surface Movement Advisor (SMA) Maintenance and Engineering Services, and that it is a request for a solicitation package.  It shall also contain the company point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address.  Since the solicitation will be issued electronically, it is essential that the e-mail address be included.   Address request to the Federal Aviation Administration, William J. Hughes Technical Center, Attn:  Ms. Brenda Wendling, ACX-51, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ 08405.  The fax number is: (609)-485-4088.  The e-mail address is: Brenda.wendling@faa.gov No telephonic requests will be honored.   The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the request for offers, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement.

<DESC>The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to award a soles source contract to Mediatech, Inc. (Mediatech) to upgrade the classroom lecterns at the NRC Technical Training Center. The NRC Technical Training Center (TTC) has five classrooms, each of which contains a multimedia lectern that is used to control the presentation equipment available in the classroom. These lecterns were obtained in August, 1998, through a contract with MediaVisions, Inc., and were manufactured by Mediatech. The control interface for each lectern consists of a touchscreen connected to a small computer, which sends signals through a series of switches, adapters, and converters to the different pieces of presentation equipment. The control software is proprietary to Mediatech. The purpose of this procurement is to upgrade the hardware and software contained in the five TTC multimedia lecterns to take advantage of advances made in the control system software and hardware, and to simplify their configuration to provide higher reliability and reduce lifecycle maintenance costs.  The upgrades must be fully compatible with the existing classroom presentation equipment. Competition of this requirement is not considered feasible since the control software package and any updates are copyrighted by the manufacturer and thus are unavailable for use by the NRC in a competitive environment. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within by September 12, 2003 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  C. Ratwatte, Chairman, Energy Supply Committee, Secretary, Ministry of Finance, 13th Floor, BOC Merchant Tower Building, No. 28 St. Michael’s Road, Colombo -3, Sri Lanka, Phone: (94-1) 391-006 or 391-007, Fax: (94-1) 391-008.
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical asssistnace for a 300 MW coal fire power plant in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka has recently experienced extended periods of power blackouts due to a lack of power generation capacity.  Although the country’s installed generating capacity is substantially higher than peak power demands, it has been unable to keep up with the growing need for electricity.  This is largely due to the low level of rainfall that has prevailed during the last few monsoon seasons.  Sri Lanka is vulnerable to power shortages because it has built a power system based largely on hydroelectric generation.  A number of new oil fired projects are being commissioned, and additional units are being built, that will solve the immediate needs for added generating capacity.  However, the country must act quickly to head off further periods of blackouts in the next five or six years. 

One of the major projects now under development is a 3x300 MW coal fired plant to be located on the eastern or southern coast.  This plant needs to be in operation by 2008 according to current forecasts of demand growth.  This will be the first coal fired plant in the country, and the Grantee will need significant expert assistance from abroad to get the project completed on time.  

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has determined that the plant will be constructed in three equal units of 300 MW each at a single site.   The Grantee has decided that the first 300 MW unit should be developed and operated by a private company.  The company will be selected through a competitive bidding process and it will develop the plant on a build, operate and own (BOO) basis.  The invitation for expressions of interest has already been advertised.  The Grantee has requested a technical assistance package to aid in soliciting offers and negotiating a long term power supply agreement for the proposed 300 MW coal fired power plant.  The plant will be located at one of the sites that have been identified as potentially suitable locations for a large power station.  These sites include Trincomalee, Hambantota and Mawella. 

CEB is an enterprise owned by the Government of Sri Lanka, established for the development and co-ordination of generation, transmission and distribution of electrical energy in Sri Lanka.  During the year 2003, the CEB is expected to be unbundled into six companies.  As such, the development of this project has been placed with the Energy Supply Committee, a special committee set up by the Prime Minister to move priority projects forward at an expedited pace.  The Energy Supply Committee is comprised of representatives of CEB, the Board of Investment, and several key Ministries.  The Energy Supply Committee of the Government of Sri Lanka is the Grantee. 

The Study will include the following components:

Task 1 – Project Work Plan and Schedule
Task 2 – Site Reconnaissance and Preliminary Environmental Impact Study
Task 3 – Preliminary Plant Design and Cost Estimate
Task 4 – Conceptual Transmission Study
Task 5 – Review of Pre-qualification Documentation and Evaluation of Pre-Qualification    Proposals
Task 6 – Preparation of Request for Proposals Documentation
Task 7- Evaluation of Bids Up To the Issuance of Letter of Intent (LOI)
Task 8- Negotiation of the Project Agreements with the Preferred Bidder(s)
Task 9- Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $560,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M. on October 6, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Experimental Immunology Branch (EIB), plans to procure a FLUOStar Optima Plate Reader from BMG Labtechnologies, Inc., 2415 Presidential Drive, Bldg 204-118, Durham, NCI 27703.  The Immune Targeting Section, EIB/NCI studies Toll-like receptors (TLRs), their structure, function and cell biology.  The function of TLRs is studied by measuring luciferase reporter induction and by assaying cytokine and chemokine production.  Luciferase is detected by measuring luminescence, and the most accurate way of doing this requires a plate reader with microinjectors.  Cytokines, chemokines and protein concentrations are measured using ELISAs, and to do this we require a microplate reader that measures both absorbance and fluorescence.  These measurements are  done routinely and a microplate reader is required that measures all of the above, without involved conversion procedures.  The data must be output in a method that is easily analyzed using common spreadsheets, which are available on each investigator’s personal computer. In addition, the instrument is equipped with two reagent injectors, allowing measurement of flash and glow luminescence for dual luciferase assays.  The technology of the instrument will also allow us to perform time-resolved assays.  It will also allow us to read plates with 6-384 wells.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 p.m. EDT, on September 2, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.   NAICS 334516

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Applied Research Program (ARP) and Surveillance Research Program (SRP), plan to procure on a sole source basis services for the Assessment of Various Measures of Health Disparities Using Databases Relevant to Healthy People 2010 Cancer Related Goals with The University of Michigan, School of Public Health, Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health, 109 Observatory Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2029. The overall Healthy People 2010 goal related to cancer is to “reduce the number of new cancer cases as well as the illness, disability, and death caused by cancer”. Health disparities in outcomes have been observed among racial and ethnic groups, and in association with variations in demographic characteristics such as poverty, geographic factors, education, access to health care and health insurance. It is of crucial importance to agree on validated, consistent indices to measure health disparities as they pertain to progress against cancer prior to the mid-course review.  To achieve this requires examination of a number of health disparity indices using actual cancer related data. The goal of this work is to identify datasets and specific variables that are appropriate for examination of the utility of various specific measures of health disparities as they pertain to cancer related issues; and to compare the effectiveness of these measures to capture and quantify the health disparity between two or more groups.
The University of Michigan, School of Public Health, The Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health is the only source known to the NCI that is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because of their expertise and work with measures of social inequalities in health. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with the ICF Consulting Group located in Fairfax, Virginia to continue the development of a Seafood Inspection Data System (SIDS).  The NOAA Seafood Inspection Program is enhancing a 32-bit Visual Basic client-server application running on an Oracle database.  The SIDS application will help the Seafood Inspection Program electronically produce and report on numerous seafood certificates issued by the Program.  The tasks focus on resolving known problems with the software, determining management reporting requirements, designing and developing the management reports, developing new electronic certificates that will replace the current hard-copies, and identifying additional functions for the application.  The ICF Consulting Group has been involved with the development of this software application and wrote the existing application code.  The requirements of the Statement of Work require the technical knowledge of the Visual Basic and Internet applications.  The Seafood Inspection Program offers a variety of inspection services to all segments of the seafood industry from harvesters to retailers.  These services include in-plant sanitation, product inspection, grading and certification services, as well as domestic and international training and consulting services.  The overall objective of SIDS is to provide an interactive database that allows for data input, reports, and queries by program personnel in Silver Spring and field offices.  The database is separated into specific modules pertaining to various elements of the inspection program, such as product labels, inspection certificates, and contracts.  One of the functions will allow program staff in field locations to enter inspection data and print a completed inspection certificate, which can be forwarded to the customer who requested the inspection.  The data will be saved and can be viewed in various sorted formats as needed by program staff.  Currently, inspection data are not interactive or in any centralized, national database, therefore not easily available to program personnel.  The period of performance shall be twelve (12) months.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Inter-American Foundation, through Bureau of the Public Debt, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis, a contract with Inter-American Dialogue, 1211 Connecticut Avenue, Suite 510, Washington DC  20036, to procure services to organize and implement a regional workshop that will present effective practices in socio-economic development within communities of African descent and conduct training on implementing local development partnerships.  As a member of the Inter-Agency Consultation on Race in Latin America (IAC), the Inter-American Foundation is actively involved in promoting greater awareness of the particular issues facing communities of African descent in the region.  The IAC conducts conferences and workshops every year, sponsored by different IAC members.   In 2000, the World Bank sponsored the annual IAC conference; in 2001, the Inter-American Development Bank sponsored the annual IAC conference; and in 2002, the Pan American Health Organization sponsored the annual IAC conference.  The IAF has agreed to sponsor the annual conference by convening a workshop in Honduras that will promote the integration of civil society organizations of African descent throughout the Hemisphere with various stakeholders (ie. development organizations and the local private and public sector).  The IAC expects other member agencies to contribute towards the costs of the workshop, as members have done with past conferences.  It is an avenue for the IAF to provide essential training and networking opportunities.  The objectives of the workshop are as follows: 1) Draw attention to the successes as well as the challenges of implementing local development partnerships that emphasize: economic development, citizen participation or municipal partnerships (the participant profile will emphasize the involvement of grassroots organizations that would most benefit from training) 2) Provide training on implementing local development partnerships 3) Create an opportunity for increasing channels of communication among civil society, private sector, local and national governments and with officials from participating institutions of the IAC. The Contractor shall support the IAF in its efforts to provide training to communities of African descent.  The contractor shall organize and implement the regional workshop and procure a suitable location for its activities.  The workshop will be structured as trainer-facilitated group sessions and plenary sessions that will include panels and presentations.  This format should allow participants to be actively engaged and learn from each other’s experiences.  Site visits to local projects and opportunities for networking among various stakeholders will be included in the agenda.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks:  1) Organize and implement a 3-day workshop in February 2004 in Central America, preferably Honduras 2) Identify and procure conference site for 100 participants 3) Convene a steering committee of Afro-descendent leaders and IAF to develop the agenda for the workshop and criteria for conference participation, disseminate information on the workshop to generate participation, set up a workshop registration form via Internet, review applications, select participants, and handle other relevant logistics 4) Procure qualified trainers and facilitators 5) Identify organizations and projects for local site visits 6) Communicate regularly with key stakeholders in the United States and Latin America (i.e. other IAC members, Afro-descendent leaders) and other interested parties (i.e. academics, Congressional Black Caucus) about workshop progress and solicit their feedback regarding agenda and participation 7) Arrange for publicity and high-level participation from government and business leaders from the region 8) Provide logistical support; Serve as lead contact for all travel coordination and logistics, invitations and troubleshooting; Disseminate workshop results and proceedings: coordinate materials, prepare conference reports suitable for publication and organize audio visual equipment.   The following deliverables are required under this contract: 1) A work plan approved by the IAF Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), due within 15 days of the contract award 2) Monthly updates to steering committee: this may include meetings, conference calls and other electronic correspondence 3) The establishment of criteria to be utilized for the selection of trainers and facilitators 4) The creation and implementation of promotional materials to disseminate about the workshop, an application process to be utilized for the selection of workshop participants from throughout the region, a website to accept applications and disseminate workshop results 5) A workshop agenda  6) The procurement of a conference site suitable for 100 participants 7) A workshop report suitable for publication that will be disseminated among the IAC audience, i.e., Latin American NGOs, government officials, development practitioners and officials of IAC member organizations.   It should include recommendations for the format and methodology of a similar workshop to be held in South America in 2005.  Firms must submit a description of their capabilities in sufficient technical detail to substantiate the ability of any alternative source who can meet all these requirements.   If no affirmative written response is received by 2 PM EDT on Monday, September 8, 2003, to the effect that a comparable contractor is available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining the services through the proposed contractor, a sole-source award will be made.

<DESC>Description.
NAICS code 541199.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13 “Simplified Acquisition Procedures” (48 CFR Part 13), the United States Department of Commerce is providing widespread notice of this acquisition opportunity and is requesting proposals to provide a training course of at least 40 hours in the practice of international commercial arbitration leading to certification in arbitration. The course will preferably be held in the United States for up to 20 West African ADR providers. In addition, a facilitator will work over the course of 16 hours with the participants to develop and produce a standard curriculum for an arbitration course to be taught in West Africa by the participants upon their return to their respective home countries. This project may require an instructor to co-teach an arbitration course in West Africa at a later stage. Materials developed under this contract, specifically the new curriculum for West Africa, will be copyrighted by CLDP. It is anticipated that the course and curriculum development workshop will commence before September 30, 2003 and last approximately 7 business days.  

Evaluation Criteria. The contractor should have the following technical capabilities: 

1. Significant experience (at least 10 years)  and proven success in training of English and French speaking foreign professionals in arbitration;

2. Significant practical experience (at least 10 years) instructing courses in alternative dispute resolution and commercial arbitration specifically;

3. United States location preferred.  

Response Requirements.  Interested offerors are requested to submit a brief capability statement (not to exceed five (5) pages) which comprehensively addresses each criterion set forth above. Cost and technical proposals are not required and will not be considered at this time. The Government will review and evaluate timely received capability statements and those offerors who meet the Evaluation Criteria will be deemed “qualified”. The Government will then furnish each qualified offeror with a draft copy of the Statement of Work, source selection criteria and proposal instructions. The Government may enter into discussions with qualified offeror after receipt of capability statements and after receipt of proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that such discussions are necessary, the Government will notify qualified offeror of the date/time for such discussions. For the sake of clarity, the Government may communicate with qualified offeror at any point during evaluation of the capability statements and proposal evaluation process. The Government also reserves the right to award without discussions at the Contracting Officer’s discretion.   

Contract Type and Period of Performance. The Government anticipates issuing a Purchase Order for a firm-fixed price that will require the contractor to complete the required work within 150 days of Purchase Order award. 

Additional Information. Compliance with protocol between the governments of the Country and the United States of America in connection with performance of the Contract will be required.  Qualified offerors will be briefed on the protocols and security requirements. The protocols and security requirements are not available for public dissemination.  Qualified offerors who have been provided with the protocol and security information will be forbidden from disclosing the terms, content and procedures of the protocol and security. Furthermore, while in the County, the selected contractor will be representing the Commercial Law Development Program, the U.S. Department of Commerce and, by extension, the United States Government. The contractor will therefore be required to adhere to all applicable ethics codes in effect in their respective jurisdictions and professions and contractors also must adhere to applicable federal conflict of interest statutes and standards of conduct.

Response Requirements.  Interested offerors must submit two (2) copies of capability statements on or before 09/09/03.  The capability statements must specifically and comprehensively address the Evaluation Criteria and be submitted in writing.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The Air Force Security  Assistance Center (AFSAC), Wright Patterson AFB, OH is  seeking qualified, interested sources to provide  Communication Security (COMSEC) support for the several  Middle Eastern countries.   These are potentially separate  contracts for each individual country.  THERE IS NO PROMISE  OF A CONTRACT.    All work will be performed near a major  city within each country.   The support shall consist of  two (2) custodian managers to administer and maintain the  secure communication equipment in country.  The  individuals’ chosen will serve for a period not-to-exceed 2  years and will hold the positions of primary and alternate  COMSEC managers to the country.  The COMSEC managers must  have a secret clearance prior to proposing on this sources  sought with the US government.  This clearance will allow  the custodians to access and handle classified  information/data.  The managers will be responsible for the  receipt, custody, issue safeguarding, and when necessary  destruction of COMSEC material.  The COMSEC managers are  further responsible for the maintenance of up-to-date  records and the submission of all required accounting  reports.   Security for Commercial Contractor A.	Commercial firms with contracts to provide services  to overseas countries may register their personnel with the  Embassy.  Posts should provide security awareness  information to the employees of commercial firms similar to  that received by USG employees.  However, anti-terrorism  and security training protection is the responsibility of  the commercial firm, and this allocation and responsibility  should be written into any contract.   B.	Commercial firms may also receive security-related  information through an affiliation with the State  Department’s overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) in  Washington.  Americans incorporated or affiliated with  commercial contracting firms can join OSAC by applying via  the OSAC website (http://www.ds-osac.org).  OSAC has also  formed individual OSAC Country Councils to enable resident  US private sector organizations to exchange security  related information.  Commercial Contractors should check  to see if their post has formed an OSAC Country Council and  if so, encourage all US private sector organizations to  join.   The incumbent COMSEC managers must be familiar with the C3I  and/or C4I systems, as well as the following regulations  and/or manuals: -	Air Force Communications Security Operations AFKAG-1 -	Air Force Communications Security Operations AFKAG-2 -	Air Force COMSEC Accounting Manual -	Air Force Inspection 33-201 -	Air Force Systems Security Instructions  (AFSSI) -	Central Office Record (COR) If these potential contracts were awarded, the incumbents  would be responsible for all material in his or her  possession.

<DESC>THIS IS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NUMBER BBGCON1503S5397 POSTED ON AUGUST 9, 2003 FOR R -- PROFESSIONAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND MANAGEMENT SUPPORT SERVICES.  This solicitation is amended to provide answers to questions submitted by interested offeror(s): Question 1- I have no previous contracts to report.  Is it advisable to include a description of my previous work experience to demonstrate my skills and capabilities, or to submit the names of people who are familiar with my work? Answer 1-It is advisable to submit a description of previous professional experiences that demonstrate skills relevant to the work described in the solicitation.  References are also useful, but do not substitute for a full account of professional experience.  Question 2- Is the reference to FAR clause 52.232-4 actually a reference to 52.212-4 (a typo)?  Answer 2 - It is a typo.  The correct reference is FAR clause 52.212-4.  Question 3 - Please describe in detail the expectations for data management specified in items 11, 12 and 13: Question 3(a) - Item 11 = "clean and encode survey responses." What processes do clean and encode encompass? Answer 3(a) - Questionnaire responses should be checked for logical consistency, out-of-range responses, and other errors at the data-entry stage.  Paper and pencil survey responses are to be encoded into machine-readable data files.  Question 3(b.1) - Item 12 = "…process data collected; prepare tabulations in data books." What does process refer to with regard to this data?  Answer 3(b.1) - See Answer 3(a).  Question 3(b.2) - What tabulations are required?  Answer 3(b.2) - Frequency tabulations of results, plus cross tabs by gender and age, with breaks to be decided in further discussions with Contractor.  Question 3(b.3) - What are data books? Answer 3(b.3) - Compilation of data tabs. Question 3(c) - Item 13 =  "… all necessary information and results…" Describe what this information and these results are expected to be. Answer 3(c) - Electronic data files showing results; tabulated as specified by IBB. Question 4 - Will there be required any submission of data analysis as part of the weekly report?  If so, what will that consist of? Answer 4- None, other than submission of data tabs.  Question 5 - 1. Please clarify what tasks fall under CLIN1 and which fall under CLIN2. CLIN1 states that the goal is to "Design, develop, translate and print sample plan". It's not precisely clear what the IBB is referring to. It could be inferred that intent of the IBB is to separate the costs of planning from the actual execution of the study since CLIN2 refers specifically to study execution ("Conduct research and submit research data to IBB in electronic form weekly"). (a) For example, if the IBB wishes to see a plan for the research developed by the Offeror, get agreement in principle from the subcontractor that it can be executed at an agreed cost, translate this plan (into Arabic?), and submit a document for approval by the IBB, then there would be some nominal costs involved in planning and CLIN1 would be a relatively small item. (b) Alternatively, if the IBB wishes to have the Offeror and the putative subcontractor design, develop, translate into local dialect Arabic for each of the 4 study sites, and print not only a research plan but also a screener and a combined survey and data collection instrument, then additional costs would be involved. (c) If the IBB wishes to specifically separate planning from execution, then it could be inferred that general establishment of a partnership between the Offeror and the subcontractor, training of staff and interviewers at the study sites, and the execution of a small pilot study to qualify MP3 file handing and data exchange would come under CLIN1. This would make CLIN1 significantly more effort intensive, since costs to visit all four research sites would be incurred by the Offeror. (d) As well, the subcontractor has indicated that there would be costs incurred to actually "set-up" the research. Does this fall under CLIN1 (planning) or CLIN2 (execution). These costs are typically for planning and the purchase of equipment. We could, of course, have the subcontractor break those out differently after a clarification regarding CLIN1 and CLIN2.  Answer 5 - CLIN 1 should be taken to refer to all preparatory steps that must be undertaken prior to the commencement of actual fieldwork.  The precise sequence of these steps is to some extent up to the discretion of the offeror; however, such preparatory work would be expected to include the following, at a minimum: (1) establishment of relationships with any subcontractors necessary to perform the work in the countries specified; (2) design, translation, and printing of screener and survey instruments; (3) development and testing of procedures for hook tapes to subcontractors at each location; (4) development of sampling and recruitment procedures; (5) training of interviewers.  Any costs incurred during this phase could be invoiced under CLIN 1.  Question 6 - Since the period of the contract is 52 weeks, there will be some weeks involved in the planning of the research, training of local subcontractors, piloting of the survey instrument and data collection, etc. The actual execution of the research will therefore be for less than 52 weeks. Should the bid for CLIN2 be submitted for the number of weeks projected for actual data collection? Does the IBB have any specific requirements with regard to the number of weeks for which it requires data?  Answer 6 - The contract's period of performance is 52 weeks from the date of contract award.  PROPOSALS ARE DUE AT THE BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS, OFFICE OF CONTRACTS, ATTENTION: MARLENE BROOKS, 330 C STREET, SW, ROOM 2527, WASHINGTON, DC 20237 ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2003 AT 2:00 P.M., EASTERN STANDARD TIME. PROPOSALS MUST BE SIGNED BY AN OFFICIAL AUTHORIZED TO BIND THE ORGANIZATION.

AGAIN, NO SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  This is for information on source availability only.   No site visits or pre-solicitation conference will be held until a determination of source availability is made by this Office.  If a contract should be awarded as a result of any A76 competition, it will be because the cost of contracting are lower than the cost of continued Government performance as prescribed in the current OMB A76 Circular and Revised Supplemental Handbook.  All Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. The successful offeror shall provide all management, supervision, quality control, coordination, personnel and labor to perform the above services. Due to the type of work conducted in BEP, it is required that contractor personnel be United States citizens. Additionally, some of the functions involve working with sensitive information; therefore, all company personnel must be eligible for a full access security clearance. It is anticipated that there will be one procurement action required to complete this action, if the cost comparison results in contract award. The expected term of the contract shall be an initial one-year award and four one-year options with a total contract period not-to-exceed 60 months.  A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is issuing this SECOND NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT (under OMB Circular A-76) at Washington, DC and Fort Worth. In response to the announced Commercial Activity study, this study of 30 positions covering Ink Making and Roller Recovery (the function), complies with the current procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, the Commercial Activities program and Revised Supplemental Handbook. Services involved are described below for each functional element. A cost comparison will be performed IF SOURCES CAN BE FOUND, other than SICPA.  To date, the only source in the United States that has come forth is SICPA.  If no other firms come forth other than SICPA, competition is considered to be non-attainable, and thus the potential CA study may be cancelled in accordance with FAR Part 7.303.  If sources are found, a solicitation may be issued later in the calendar year to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the ink making and roller recovery services performed by Government.  Therefore, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing BEP is earnestly seeking any and all qualified ink making and roller recovery capable vendors nationwide that have the technical capability, background, skilled personnel, past experience and resources to provide the Bureau with the functional work of Ink Manufacturing and Roller Recovery operations. 

A statement of work is not yet completed, but is expected in the next several months.  In the meantime, the BEP is SEEKING ALL SOURCES for Ink Manufacturing at Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX. The Washington and Fort Worth facilities both produce a variety of different inks each year for use in the production of U.S. currency.  The inks produced are 1) intaglio inks used on intaglio printing presses and 2) high security inks for use on letterpress presses.  The equipment used to produce the different types of inks includes automated batching systems for weighing ink ingredients, industrial mixers of varying capacities and high-pressure three-roll mills for complete dispersion of raw materials.  Since the quality of the inks produced at the Bureau is very critical, a testing laboratory staffed with full-time chemists is maintained in the section to perform certification tests on all ink batches.  Inks must pass the respective tests before they can be used in currency presses.  In addition to regular ink production, the Ink Manufacturing Section also provides technical support for the development of new and experimental inks.  Roller Recovery Section Operation: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing Roller Recovery Section produces wiper rolls and inking-in rolls for the cylinder wipe, intaglio printing presses used to print U.S. currency. To fabricate a wiper roll, three distinct layers (different formulations and physical properties) of PVC (polyvinylchloride) material are applied to a steel wiper roll core using special application and curing procedures. First,  raw materials are mixed together to make the various formulations of PVC coatings.  Then, the PVC is applied to the roll.  Following application of the PVC layers, the wiper roll surfaces are finished and polished in a lathe to obtain specific dimensions and surface finish.  To produce a wiper roll that meets the physical requirements of operating on high-speed currency presses, the Roller Recovery Section closely monitors the quality of both incoming raw materials and the PVC formulations of the respective wiper roll layers. Operation of the PVC coating machines and the mechanical soundness and condition of wiper roll cores are also monitored very closely.  When completed, all wiper rolls undergo a series of final quality inspections to assess the bonding of PVC layers, hardness and surface defects.  In addition to regular wiper roll production, the Roller Recovery Section also provides technical support for the development of experimental rolls needed for new inks and currency desi

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is issuing this NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT for an A-76 study being performed at our Washington, DC and Fort Worth, Texas locations. In response to the announced Commercial Activity study of 30 positions covering Ink Making and Roller Recovery, this action will comply with the ?current? procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, the "Commercial Activities" program. Services involved are described below for each functional element. A cost comparison will be performed later in the calendar year to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the ink making and roller recovery services performed by Government.  Therefore, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is seeking vendors nationwide that have the capability, background, skilled personnel, past experience and resources to provide the Bureau with two distinct functions:Ink Manufacturing and Roller Recovery operations.  

Ink Manufacturing is located at two geographic locations (Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX).  The Washington and Fort Worth facilities both produce a variety of different inks each year for use in the production of U.S. currency.  The inks produced are 1) intaglio inks used on intaglio printing presses and 2) high security inks for use on letterpress presses (Washington DC only).  The equipment used to produce the different types of inks includes automated batching systems for weighing ink ingredients, industrial mixers of varying capacities and high-pressure three-roll mills for complete dispersion of raw materials.  Since the quality of the inks produced at the Bureau is very critical, a testing lab performs certification tests on all ink batches produced and Inks must pass the tests before they can be used.  In addition to regular ink production, the Ink Manufacturing Section also provides technical support for the development of new and experimental inks. (NOTE:  The ink chemists and technical support staff who do ink development are NOT currently included in the number of positions subject to our A-76 analysis, since they are members of the Office of Technical Support and not the Office of Production Support as are the ink makers.)

Roller Recovery Section Operation: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing?s Roller Recovery Section produces wiper rolls and inking-in rolls for the cylinder wipe, intaglio printing presses used to print U.S. currency. To fabricate a wiper roll, three distinct layers (different formulations and physical properties) of PVC (polyvinylchloride) material are applied to a steel wiper roll core using special application and curing procedures. First,  raw materials are mixed together to make the various formulations of PVC coatings.  Then, the PVC is applied to the roll.

Operation of the PVC coating machines and the mechanical soundness and condition of wiper roll cores are also monitored very closely.  When completed, all wiper rolls undergo a series of final quality inspections to assess the bonding of PVC layers, hardness and surface defects.  In addition to regular wiper roll production, the Roller Recovery Section also provides technical support for the development of experimental rolls needed for new inks and currency design features.

<DESC>NA A site visit was conducted at TMP Number 4 Holloman Air Force Base on 20 August 2003.  A list of attendees may be found at http://www.wsmr.army.mil/docpage/pages/sol_stat.htm.  At the site visit, one question was put in writing to the Government.  It was: JP-8 is a hazardous material.  The Wage Determination states high risk or low risk, 8 percent times hourly wage or 4 percent times hourly wage?  The Government's response to the question is as follows:  JP-8 is a hazardous material and a flammable substanc e with a flashpoint of 100 degrees F.; however, most hazards of its use have been engineered out through the use of safety equipment such as gloves, face shields, grounding and bonding wires, closed circuit nozzles, proper clothing, etc.  In addition, the Government provides training on the proper handling of such substances.  The Wage Determination states that these differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material  differential pay.  This agency has not designated refueling airplanes as being eligible for hazardous pay differential.  5 CFR 532 covers prevailing rate systems.  Appendix A to 5 CFR 532 lists the environmental differentials authorized for exposure to va rious degrees of hazards, physical hardships, and working conditions of an unusual nature.  Refueling planes is not listed as being authorized for hazardous duty differential.

Question, The Polycom iPower 9800 number is specific to some vendor but not Polycom.  Please provide a PolyCom item number or a detailed description of the items with the system.  Also the iPower 9800 does not come with RS449 connection.  Could it be V.35?

Answer:  This product is Polycom equipment, the model number (CP-2855-98N-R) is different due to the additions.  The item is the Polycom iPower 9800 model 2855.  The RS449 connection must be provided not the V.35 connection that comes with the model.  Also a removable hard drive is included.  These are the two additions.

<DESC>Question 1: We would like to request clarification on the specs for the electrical system for the buildings in the current solicitation.  As written, that portion of the spec is identical for both buildings, and calls for "two (2) 400W metal halide lights."  In our experience, having just 2 lights in the smaller building would not provide much lighting, and in the case of the larger building, this would be extremely minimal lighting.  If it helps at all, we have a general formula that is geared to provide moderate lighting.  This formula would suggest that 4 lights are needed for the smaller building, and 10 lights are needed for the larger building (rather than 2).  Please advise whether the spec as originally written is in fact what is desired. Answer 1:  Standard lighting packages will be acceptable as long as the structures have adequate lighting.  If your firm uses a gene ral formula which supports minimal lighting quotes, please address this methodology in your quote.  Industry standard shall be the minimum requirement for lighting and should be supported by some type of engineering formula.  Question 2:  Provide clarification for door sizes for all structures:  Answer 2:  Line item 1 (12 smaller structures) are to have flat ends with MANUAL roll up warehouse type doors (12-14 feet wide x 12-14 feet height). Line Item 2 (total 6 larger structures) 5 are to have "clamshell" type doors on both ends powered by MECHANICAL winches WITH a MANUAL option if the winch goes down.  The 6th structure will have flat ends with MANUAL warehouse doors on both ends (12-14 feet wide x 12-14 feet height)..  Large enough to fit a forktruck through. Also the question was asked regarding what type of "large door" for the end door of the 5 buildings.  Thos e would be the "clamshell" type or similar door.  Some vendors have a sliding type door that has been used by the Navy in the past. It is the same idea as clamshell in that it opens the entire end of the tent and is therefore an acceptable door for this procurement. Question 3:  What we need to clarify is the overall length of the structure.  I have  included a diagram to show what we are questioning.  Does the approximately  113' length include the main body of the structure, less the doors, or does  it include the total length of the structure to the outer most dimensions  of the "clamshell" doors in their closed (down) position? Answer 3:  The 113 ft would ideally be the over all length of the tents... Doors included.  The 6th, flat end tent, would ideally be 113 ft overall as well.  The government understands the clamshell doors provide some extra square footage.. . By adding or subtracting standard sections of the main body, the government desires to come as close to 113 ft overall size as possible.  If this is not possible, the government will consider accepting the 5 "clamshell door" tent's main body to be 113 ft, neglecting any gains from the doors. The 6th, flat end tent, would need to be 113 ft overall.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment No.1, is to extend the Closing Date of Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 522-03-040 for the Procurement of Medical Equipment. Due date is extended to February 13, 2003 at 3:00 pm Honduran time.  Following are the respond to questions raised under the RFP No. 522-03-040:

QUESTION AND ANSWERS:

1-Is the original response date of January 31st being pushed back? 
Response: Yes, Due Date has been extended to February 13, 2003 at 3:00 pm.

2- What dimensions and/or type of fiber glass/heavy duty plastic chairs are you seeking?

3- What is the desired thickness of the conductive litter pad?
Response: Same response of question No. 2.

4- Since this is a USAID funded project, does the geographical code 000 apply to this RFP? Should the product be manufactured in the US only?
Response: Geographic Code is: ?000? USA only.

5-The specification for item # 8 - Balance Beam Pediatric Scale is asking for "Capacity 361 Lb", which is probably a misspelling. Could you, please, clarify what capacity is acceptable?

<DESC>Purpose of this modification is to post the following questions and answers:

Questions:
1) The spec calls for Milb 131H Class 1 and Mil B 117F. Both those specs are fairly outdated and have been updated or revised to Mil PRF 131 (which is a performance for 131 type materials) and the 117 spec is now Mil DTL 117 which is also a revision concerning bag construction. Normally the spec requires that both the 131 and the 117 be printed on the bags, however this is a small bag which requires "114q" be printed on the bag. The question is; does the bags have to have the 131 and the 117 printed along with 114q?

Answer:  Bags do not have to have the 131 and the 117 printed along with "114q".	

2. What size is the print for the "114q" ?   
Answer:  2/10th of an inch.

3. What color is the printed? 

Answer: black print

4. Concerning question 1, can we certify to spec requested with a "Certificate of Conformance" and not print the bags with 117 or 131?
Answer:  Yes

<RESPDATE>090303
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Nancy Lawson, Contract Specialist, null, Contra= cting Officer - Nancy Lawson, Contract Specialist, null
<DESC>The Department of VA, Austin Automation Center is seeking sources for=  a solution to migrate from a mainframe accounting system to a server based accounting system for the following:  The customer is currently using a COBOL home grown solution for General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivables and Fixed Assets. This application was first written in 1984. The user has also implemented Oracle database for Purchasing, Receiving, Inventory Management, Sales and Payroll Deduction.  These two systems do not share a real-time integration.=20 Currently, a batch process kicks off nightly to update the Oracle database with data from the COBOL system. The VCS primary business objective is to implement to a next generation architecture and software solution that will allow them to support the growing needs of their business.  The client goal is to migrate the General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable and Fixed Assets to a server based accounting solution which will communicate in real time with existing server based Purchasing, Receiving, Inventory Management, Sales and Payroll Deduction system. The following is a list of additional customer requirements: i.=09The system must support Pre-Pay Payables. The customer has contracts with certain vendors that are paid before the invoice is actually received. Once the invoice is received, then it is marked off in the system as paid.  These invoices can be processed in batches using a specific variance.=20 ii.=09The system must support the Prompt Pay Act. Any invoices not paid within a 30 day period automatically accrue interest and is paid to the vendor. The system must calculate the interest due if the invoice is being paid after 30 days.=20 iii.=09The system must support the ability for 300 remote users to access monthly reports without the need for a dedicated user license. The reports should only show the information that is related to the user business unit/location.=20 iv.=09The system must support Certification. Certification is the process of auditing the work of a Technician.

<SUBJECT>M -- A76 ROLLER RECOVERY AND INK MANUFACTURING
<SOLNBR>BEP-03-0021
<RESPDATE>121302
<CONTACT>Robert Knauer, Contracting Officer, Phone (202)874-5827, Fax (202)874-3135, Email Robert.Knauer@bep.treas.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is issuing this NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT for an A-76 study being performed at our Washington, DC and Fort Worth, Texas locations. In response to the announced Commercial Activity study of 30 positions covering Ink Making and Roller Recovery, this action will comply with the ?current? procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, the "Commercial Activities" program. Services involved are described below for each functional element. A cost comparison will be performed later in the calendar year to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the ink making and roller recovery services performed by Government.  Therefore, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is seeking vendors nationwide that have the capability, background, skilled personnel, past experience and resources to provide the Bureau with two distinct functions:Ink Manufacturing and Roller Recovery operations.  

Ink Manufacturing is located at two geographic locations (Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX).  The Washington and Fort Worth facilities both produce a variety of different inks each year for use in the production of U.S. currency.  The inks produced are 1) intaglio inks used on intaglio printing presses and 2) high security inks for use on letterpress presses.  The equipment used to produce the different types of inks includes automated batching systems for weighing ink ingredients, industrial mixers of varying capacities and high-pressure three-roll mills for complete dispersion of raw materials.  Since the quality of the inks produced at the Bureau is very critical, a testing laboratory staffed with full-time chemists is maintained in the section to perform certification tests on all ink batches.  Inks must pass the respective tests before they can be used in currency presses.  In addition to regular ink production, the Ink Manufacturing Section also provides technical support for the development of new and experimental inks. (NOTE:  The ink chemists and technical support staff who do ink development are NOT currently included in the number of positions subject to our A-76 analysis, since they are members of the Office of Technical Support and not the Office of Production Support as are the ink makers.)

Roller Recovery Section Operation: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing?s Roller Recovery Section produces wiper rolls and inking-in rolls for the cylinder wipe, intaglio printing presses used to print U.S. currency. To fabricate a wiper roll, three distinct layers (different formulations and physical properties) of PVC (polyvinylchloride) material are applied to a steel wiper roll core using special application and curing procedures. First,  raw materials are mixed together to make the various formulations of PVC coatings.  Then, the PVC is applied to the roll.  Following application of the PVC layers, the wiper roll surfaces are finished and polished in a lathe to obtain specific dimensions and surface finish.  To produce a wiper roll that meets the physical requirements of operating on high-speed currency presses, the Roller Recovery Section closely monitors the quality of both incoming raw materials and the PVC formulations of the respective wiper roll layers. Operation of the PVC coating machines and the mechanical soundness and condition of wiper roll cores are also monitored very closely.  When completed, all wiper rolls undergo a series of final quality inspections to assess the bonding of PVC layers, hardness and surface defects.  In addition to regular wiper roll production, the Roller Recovery Section also provides technical support for the development of experimental rolls needed for new inks and currency design features.    

ACTION REQUIRED: It is requested that any vendor in the United States having the skilled personnel, talent, capability, resources and past experience to provide the above service and operation of these functions provide by email the following information to the point of contract indicated in this notice, Mr. ROBERT KNAUER.  Please provide:

1. Name of Company Contract
2. Phone and Fax numbers
3. Email addresses
4. Company Website address
5. At least six (6) commercial and government references that can verify that your firm has done the type of work contemplated and that provides information about the quality of your past performance. Include the following information for each contract:

1. Name of Contracting Activity or Customer
2. Contract Number or Other Identification Number
3. Contract Type
4. Total Contract Value or Volume
5. Description of Service 
6. Contracting Officer Point of Contact and Telephone Number
7. Technical/Project Manager Point of Contact and Telephone Number
8. Provide a brief (2page) description of your firm?s history and organization and a description of its facilities, products, services, and customers as they relate to performance of pre-and post-award contracting for the commercial and Government.

AGAIN, NO SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  This is for information on source availability only.   No site visits or pre-solicitation conference will be held until a determination of source availability is made by this Office.  If a contract should be awarded as a result of any A76 competition, it will be because the cost of contracting is lower than the cost of continued Government performance as prescribed in the current OMB A76 Circular and Revised Supplemental Handbook.  All Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. The successful offeror shall provide all management, supervision, quality control, coordination, personnel and labor to perform the above services. Due to the type of work conducted in BEP, it is required that contractor?s personnel be United States citizens. Additionally, some of the functions involve working with sensitive information; therefore, all company personnel must be eligible for a full access security clearance. It is anticipated that there will be one procurement action required to complete this action, if the cost comparison results in contract award. The expected term of the contract shall be an initial one-year award and four one-year options with a total contract period not-to-exceed 60 months.  A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.

DESC:  Sources Sought Synopsis.  Contracting Point of Contact:  Marialyn Achille-Argaez, Contract Specialist, (505) 846-6876, Technical Point of Contact:   Dr. John Gonglewski, (505) 846-4405. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Contracting Directorate on behalf of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (DE), Kirtland AFB, NM is seeking interested parties to submit a Statement of Capability pertaining to follow-on work on AFRL’s “Applications of Lidar for Vehicles with Analysis (ALVA)” Program.  The follow-on work will have a period of performance of five (5) years and a contract ceiling of $49 million.  The anticipated contract type will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee instrument.  BACKGROUND:  The Air Force Research Laboratory’s Advanced Optics and Imaging Division is seeking to acquire design, fabrication, test, evaluation, deployment of Lidars, laser radars, laser metrology, and complementary passive sensor systems in airborne, space-borne, or special test facilities.   Included is support to USAF assets and test sites for prototyping and understanding the role of non-weapons class lasers, laser radars, laser sensing, remote sensing and measurement systems, and general imaging systems.  Such assets include the Maui Space Surveillance Site (MSSS); USAF’S Argus or Cobra Ball or similar aircraft; Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB); and other DoD service facilities such as White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) AND THE pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF).  Also included are the appropriate program planning and mission analysis for such systems.  The goal of this effort is to establish a technology base for and initial field demonstrations of advanced sensor systems suitable for airborne, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV’s) and space-borne missions and upgrade to MSSS imaging capabilities.  Special interest will be shown to new ideas and technologies in laser components; to airborne platform approaches and capabilities to terrain imaging, target identification, remote sensing, and designation; to laser waveform approaches which show a capability to perform multiple tasks e.g., tracking and imaging by switching rapidly between waveforms, and receiver approaches which perform real-time processing of wide band (>500MHz) signals with a significant composition of COTS elements; to system volume and weight minimization; to transportability; to laser facilities use and logistics; to computer simulations, modeling and analysis of relevant USAF and DoD laser and laser radar missions.  Work is expected to be conducted at various appropriate facilities including Kirtland AFB, the contractor’s plant, and Wright-Patterson AFB.  At least 20% of this effort involves support of the MSSS, Barking Sands, and other USAF facilities in Hawaii.  In partial fulfillment of this requirement, the qualifying contractor will be required to obtain office and support facilities on both Maui and Kauai and have demonstrated successful operations in these unique environments.  Work will provide technical analysis and engineering support for R&D activities in technology areas such as:  (1)  Compact device development, analysis, field demonstrations, and prototype deployment of CO2 and solid state lasers for airborne, spacecraft, and platforms for ground-to-space imaging applications; (2)  Systems development and new concepts in laser radars for ranging, imaging, mapping, chemical detection, reconnaissance, surveillance, target designation, communications and ancillary military applications.

<RESPDATE>092303
<CONTACT>MARY ANN WATHEN 812-854-5090
<DESC>Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) is seeking sources interested in modifying commercial sonar heads as necessary to interface with the Government-owned AN/WQX-2 Advanced Capability (ADCAP) processor and software.  The intent is to develop an effective shipboard Swimmer Detection Sonar (SDS) System composed of the AN/WQX-2 ADCAP processors and software and commercially available sonar heads.  The SDS System will be used to automatically detect, classify and track swimmers and divers.  The Navy anticipates awarding one or more contracts at minimal fixed dollar amounts for this development effort; therefore, substantial investment by the contractor(s) is anticipated.  A one-day pre-solicitation meeting is planned at the Applied Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin (ARL:UT) the week of 22 September 2003 so that all eligible, prospective con tractors can become more familiar with the Navy’s requirements and intended acquisition strategy.  US or NATO Secret Security Clearances are required for all attendees.  It is expected that this development will take approximately three months.  The ARL:UT is the system designer for the AN/WQX-2 ADCAP processor and software, and as such has extensive experience in SDS Systems.  To the extent necessary and practicable, NSWC Crane and ARL:UT will assist the contractor in developing the necessary interfaces between the modified sonar head and   Government-owned AN/WQX-2 ADCAP processors and software.  The draft Interface Control Document can be found at www.crane.navy.mil/supply/homepage.htm.  The draft Technical Performance Requirements for the sonar head may be obtained after 27 August 2003 by contacting the POC below.  Following the development phase, testing will be conducted  by the Navy to determine the technical performance of both the modified sonar head alone and the complete SDS system.  To facilitate this testing, contractors will be required to loan their modified equipment to the Government at no cost under a bailment agreement for a total period of at least 6 weeks between January and July 2003.  Ultimately the Navy intends to select one or more contractor(s) for an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract option for production sonar heads that the Government will combine with the AN/WQX-2 ADCAP processors and software to form a ship-deployable SDS system.  Please contact the POC listed below on or before 12 September 2003 to state your interest and receive information on attending the pre-solicitation conference.  All inquires, comments, concerns and questions shall be directed to Mary Ann Wathen via email at wathen_m@crane.navy.m il.  To verify receipt of email, contact Ms. Wathen at 812-854-5090.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), soliciting industry interest, input and capabilities for the development of rapid cure coatings for use by the US Navy for corrosion control and protection of shipboard ballast, fuel, Combined Holding Tanks (CHT) and potable water tanks. Significant Navy forces and resources are spent in the maintenance of the Ships within the Fleet. Current coatings technology being used by the US Navy for the preservation of tanks is limited primarily to two (2) component solvent-free epoxy coatings. These coatings have significant disadvantages, in that: a) current coatings require 8-12 hours (cure to walk-on) of controlled environmental conditions and ventilation to assure proper cure and minimal damage to freshly applied system. Such requirements place considerable time constraints on adjacent application and preservation activities do to risks associated with possible damage to freshly applied coating in neighboring tanks or spaces. b) the cumulative time requirements associated with conventional coatings results in a significant portion of current ship's availability period dedicated to the allowance of proper coating curing. c) the physical application parameters of existing coatings are not ideal when considering typical Navy shipyard locations and applications conditions. Therefore, the Navy, under the Office of Naval Research (ONR), has a desire to investigate the availability and/or development of "rapid cure" coatings for shipboard tank applications meeting these desired performance standards. Applicable coatings properties to include: application under current industrial practices, as are present in a shipbuilding and ship repair environment; application using commercially available plural component equipment, as is currently employed in industrial operations to include shipyards, general construction or infrastructure maintenance; Rapid Cure coating systems, consisting of rigid (non-elastomeric) epoxy, polyurea, polyurethane, or polyurethane hybrids, wherein, the cured system exhibits performance criteria to include the following properties: 1) performance criteria, as outlined in MIL-PRF-23236B (SH), 2) cure to walk-on times ranging from 5 seconds to 30 minutes at 75 degrees Fahrenheit, Fully cured for service optimally @ 1 day, at 75 degrees Fahrenheit, 3) solvent free (95 g/l or less), 4) free of aromatic amines (methylene dianiline), 5) minimum of 70 percent edge retention at 12 mils DFT on a 1.0 mm radius applied in one-pass, 6) simple plural component mix ratios (i.e., 1:1, or 2:1), 7) suitable for seawater ballast, fuel and potable water tank application (to include NSF approval), compensated fuel/seawater, and combined holding transfer(CHT) tanks. Additionally, systems designed for exterior applications are also being sought. Coatings of interest need to exhibit application and performance properties as generally demonstrated by the current commercial industrial coatings employed for the preservation of steel and aluminum surfaces against corrosion in a seawater environment. The coatings shall not require specialized surface preparation and or application criteria beyond those currently outlined in the U.S. Navy's, Naval Ship's Technical Manual (NSTM) chapter 631 or outlined in Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Standard 009-32 for abrasive blast cleaning and coating application. In addition the coatings shall possess the ability to provide optimum performance under the application range of 18-30 mils Dry Film Thickness (DFT). All coatings shall also have the option of a repair material for touch-up of damaged areas, as is required for areas where routine maintenance and or structural repairs have been performed. As a result, this Request for Information is being issued for the purpose of identifying those companies with appropriate expertise that might be interested in responding to a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the collaborative development of corrosion control coatings, similar to those discussed in the aforementioned text. Additional information on the Navy's corrosion control coatings requirements can be obtained from Mr. Arthur A. Webb at NRL. Should an RFP be issued for the development of corrosion control coatings for the Navy, it is anticipated that costs for development would be shared between the Navy and the contractor. This notice is being issued to help determine whether the Navy should proceed with a formal request for proposals. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal request for proposals may be forthcoming. Offers should address as a minimum the following criteria: (1) capability and experience in the formulation, production and/or development of rapid cure corrosion control coatings, and (2) understanding of application and performance issues regarding surface preparation and coating application conditions as present in a shipbuilding/repair environment. Offers are also requested to provide rough-order-of-magnitude estimates of the cost to develop the various coatings technologies, as well as estimated development time frame. Such estimates would be non-binding on the offers. This announcement is a request for information and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued nor will the government pay for the information solicited. All information and data received in response to this Request for Information marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected and held in strict confidence. Responses to this notice should be provided in writing to Naval Research Laboratory, ATTN: Mr. James Martin, Code 6138, P.O. Box 1759, Key West, FL 33040-1739 and copied to Naval Research Laboratory, ATTN: Mr. Arthur A. Webb, Code 6130, 4555 Overlook Ave. SW, Washington, DC 20375-5342.  All responses must be in writing.  The FAX number is (305) 293-4213 and the e-mail address is: jmartin@ccs.nrl.navy.mil and awebb@ccs.nrl.navy.mil. No telephone responses will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>14 -- Submarine Launched Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile Technical Exchange
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to determine the latest plans and programs including technology challenges and proposed solutions for affordable Submarine Launched Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (SLIRBMs), including launch considerations and potential payloads.  Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to select presentations to be given at the upcoming SLIRBM Technical Exchange or to otherwise be reviewed by the government. 

The SLIRBM requirements include:
1.	System must be affordable
2.	Range - IRBM 
3.	Missile diameter - 32.5 inches maximum
4.	Both conventional and nuclear payloads to be considered
5.	Payload weights, diameters and length to be consistent with missile dimensions and range 
6.	Conventional payload system to have GPS accuracy 
7.	Missile subsystem hardened to Space Grade
8.	Control of collateral damage to be considered (e.g., stage debris control)
9.	Intermediate range ballistic missiles, including their payloads, and all of the launcher subsystem except for electronics, are to be contained within the 86 inch diameter TRIDENT missile launch tube
10.	 Usable missile tube length (for missile, payload and launcher) – 36 feet maximum
 
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.   

ANY CONTRACT THAT MIGHT BE AWARDED BASED ON INFORMATION RECEIVED OR DERIVED FROM THIS TECHNICAL EXCHANGE WILL BE THE OUTCOME OF THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS.

The Strategic Systems Programs (SSP), SLIRBM Integrated Product Team is holding a SLIRBM Technical Exchange in the SSP Management Center at 1000 on 22 September 2003 and continuing through the following day as necessary.  Representatives from Industry (limit, three members per company) are encouraged to attend.  At this technical exchange, SSP will present detailed Navy requirements, current and future technology plans, and ongoing programs. 

In the interest of assisting SSP in developing a comprehensive SLIRBM project plan; industry is encouraged to participate in one or both of two manners: first by presenting information they believe germane at the Technical Exchange, and second, by submitting detailed concept papers explaining their approach and technical solutions for a SLIRBM, including cost drivers.  Information relating to IRBM applications on surface ships is also sought. Those offering the first approach should submit an abstract of their proposed remarks containing the following information: a) current programs, b) future plans, and c) technology challenges and solutions.  

In addition, following the open exchange, a special session is planned for one-on-one Industry/Government briefings, each approximately 15 minutes in length. 
For all inputs: presentations, concept papers, or one-on-one briefings, information that comprehensively addresses the three technical areas of missile, payload, and launcher in a system context are desired.  However,  inputs that only address any one or two of these areas separately also are desired.  The requirement is to consider both conventional and nuclear payloads.  In doing so, if respondents believe the nuclear option is affecting affordability substantially, they are requested to separate the two payload areas so that the affordability of the conventional payload case may be understood clearly.  Similarly, respondents may present only the conventional or the nuclear payload case if their expertise is limited in this manner. 

Respondents are encouraged to provide information not constrained by proprietary data rights.  However, any proprietary data that is included in a reply should be marked appropriately.  The technical exchange is classified up to SECRET-NOFORN.  Please submit clearances to Strategic Systems Programs by Fax to (202) 764-1644.  Security clearances must be received not later than September 19, 2003.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a formal Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, as well as subject to modification, and is in no way binding on the Government.  

Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the Strategic Systems Programs, Contracting Division, ATTN: SPN.  Please provide electronic responses with this subject: RFI for Submarine Launched Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile Technical Exchange.  Responses must be received no later than September 16, 2003.*****

<SUBJECT>A -- DIGITAL INTERMEDIATE FREQUENCY (IF) MODULATOR USING PARALLEL PROCESSING
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKING LICENSEE(S) TO COMMERCIALIZE OR COLLABORATIVE R&D PARTNER(S)S TO FURTHER DEVELOP DIGITAL INTERMEDIATE FREQUENCY (IF) MODULATOR USING PARALLEL PROCESSING

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks to license this technology to industry.

Commercially available digital IF QAM modulators use sine/cosine ROMs or CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) and/or a number of multipliers to generate the IF modulated waveforms.

LLNL researchers have developed a digital intermediate frequency (IF) modulator that applies to various modulation types, and offers a simple and low cost method to implement high speed digital IF modulator. The architecture eliminates multipliers and sequential processing.  The digital parallel processing allows the low speed FPGA to be used to generate a high carrier frequency output. Another aspect of the invention is the programmability of the digital IF modulator’s carrier frequency and modulation types.

LLNL’s invention can be easily used to realize any digital IF modulator with FPGA device. This technique can be applied to direct digital synthesis. Existing commercial wireless or wire systems such as GSM, CDMA, and XDSL that use digital IF modulation of any types can benefit from this technology.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's subject technology described herein should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.
 

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO000053-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest.

    FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: September 22, 2003
4. POSITION TITLE: Local Government Program Advisor  – USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $72,381.00 - $94,098.00 per annum (GS 14 equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: December, 2003- December, 2004
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

A. Background

Four years after devastating armed conflict in Kosovo, the reconstitution of a functioning economic, political, and cultural space is well underway.  Immediately following the conflict, donor priorities were placed on providing emergency assistance and establishing a secure environment in Kosovo.  Today, having addressed the immediate humanitarian needs following the end of the conflict, donor attention has turned to longer term support for institution-building, capacity-building, and promoting democratic and economic reforms.  Although the UN Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) retains many political powers in Kosovo, the transition to self-government has already begun at both the local and central levels of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG).  Municipal elections in  2000 and 2002 were considered free and fair by the international community, and the responsibilities of the elected municipal assemblies has been outlined in UNMIK regulations, most notably UNMIK Regulation 2000/45.  

Despite this progress, the roles, authorities and responsibilities of local governments remain confused and ill-defined.  In addition, many local officials lack the skills, knowledge or capacity to adequately plan, allocate and manage resources.  Local governments need to improve transparency, accountability, and formal mechanisms to encourage public participation.  Local governments also will need to take a more active role in addressing some of the most important issues facing Kosovo, including high unemployment, low level of economic development, and normalization and reintegration of minorities and internally displaced persons (IDPs).  

At the same time, the prospects are good for donor-funded local governance assistance projects to produce significant results.  Old governance structures were largely swept away prior to the conflict and new institutions are less burdened by the communist past.  Kosovar’s show an eagerness to accept assistance and advice from the international community, and particularly the US.  A recent public opinion survey by UNDP shows that Kosovar’s hold high trust and expectations for local government.  The international community has a short window of time before poor practices, rather than best practices, become institutionalized and cynicism toward local government grows among the Kosovar population.   

USAID’s new five-year strategic plan for Kosovo lists as one of its strategic objectives: “civil society and government are more effective partners in achieving good governance.”  To help achieve that objective, USAID/Kosovo is planning a new local governance strengthening initiative to begin approximately January 2004.  This multi-million dollar activity is expected to be a cornerstone of USAID/Kosovo’s Democracy and Governance portfolio for the next three to five years.  

The expected outcomes of the USAID/Kosovo local governance strengthening program will directly contribute to achieving results as laid forth in USAID’s Assistance Strategy for Kosovo.  Specifically, the program will contribute to Strategic Objectives  2.1 A civil society and government that are more effective partners in achieving good governance and 2.2 A more capable, transparent and responsive government acting according to the rule of law, and 1.3-2 Accelerated growth of the private sector.

B. Statement of Work

The position is located in the Office of Democracy and Governance within the USAID Mission in Pristina, Kosovo.  Under the direct supervision of the Democracy and Governance Office Director, the Local Governance Program Advisor will serve as the senior team member responsible for USAID/Kosovo’s local governance strengthening activities.

·	Sphere and cylinder accuracy: Magnitude of error in measurements shall be less than 1% or 0.05D, whichever is larger.
·	Generate a mathematical description of the measured wavefront shape, and display graphical image of the measured wavefront.
·	Calculate the effective clinical prescription (sphere, cylinder axis) from the wavefront data, compute how well the wavefront can be described by spherical and cylindrical powers, and shall present this information to the operator.
·	Display the real-time Hartmann-Shack image whenever the probe beam is active.
·	Automatically process wavefront images.
·	The number of images comprising a measurement session shall be a password-protected, software configurable parameter.
·	For eyes where centration has been performed, display the frozen video image of each measurement to the operator.
·	Determine the position of the limbus relative to the instrument optical axis with an accuracy of +/-0.1 mm, 2 sigma.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Firm, fixed-price offers are requested under Request for Quotations (RFQ) solicitation #RAQ022326.  This document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-15.  This solicitation is set-aside 100% for small business.  The NAICS code is 421440.  The business size standard is 100 employees.  (1) REQUIREMENT: This solicitation is for the various components of the field coffee heating kits.  Coffee heating kits use a jet burner fueled by bottled propane as the heat source and are frequently used in remote field locations such as fire camps.  Coffee is brewed by pouring heated water through a coffee filter basket that is supported by the top of the stainless steel urn.  Stainless steel urn covers retain heat for the brewed coffee and protect the coffee from airborne particles.  Coffee is poured from the urns through two faucets at the urns' lower edge.  The coffee urns sit on seating rings with tabs supporting the rings above the jet burner.  Coffee urn stands form the base for the jet burner and allow air to circulate underneath the burner.  The items and quantities covered under this solicitation include: (a)  NFES #0481 Urn, 100 each; (b)  NFES #1083 Urn cover (lid), 100 each; (c)  NFES #0482 Basket for filter, 120 each; (d)  NFES #0484 Urn stand, 80 each; (e)  NFES #0485 Seating ring, 120 each; (f)  NFES #0488 Stove, 30 each; (g)  NFES #0490 Windshield, 20 each.  (2) SPECIFICATION:  (a) NFES #0481 Urn:  The coffee urn shall be made of minimum 16 gauge, type 304 stainless steel with #2 polish, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) A-240, food grade.  The urn unit is 21 1/2 in tall.  The top outside diameter is 19 1/8 in while the bottom outside diameter is a maximum of 16 3/4 in, in order to fit into the separate support ring that holds the urn over the jet burner.  The bottom outside diameter cannot be less than 16 5/8 in.  The coffee urn has a 20 gal capacity.  Both the top and bottom edges of the coffee urn are rolled into a 1/2 in double hem.  The bottom surface of the coffee urn is recessed 1/2 in.  All seams shall be welded on the inside and outside so there are no cracks to trap dirt, coffee grounds, or other debris.  Coffee urn has two drop-type carrying handles, one each on opposite sides.  The center lines of the handles are located 6 3/4 in from the top of the urn.  The handles shall not be set over the vertical seam.  The coffee urn has two threaded 1/2  in NPSH straight openings for chromed faucets, one each on opposite sides, set at a 90-degree turn from the handle sides.  Openings shall be 2 1/2 in from the bottom of the urn.  The faucet openings shall not be along the vertical seam.  The Government shall furnish the faucets following acceptance of the completed urns.  (b) NFES #1083 Urn cover (lid):  The urn cover shall be made of minimum 16 gauge, type 304 stainless steel with #2 polish, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) A-240, food grade.  It shall have an inside diameter of 19 3/16 in so that it fits snugly but not tightly over the urn.  The cover is 1 5/8 in high with a 1/2 in outside double hem.  Urn cover shall have a stainless steel handle spot-welded in the center of the top side.  Both the inside and outside of any seam shall be welded, or a single piece used to form the cover so there are no inside cracks to trap foreign particles.  (c) NFES #0482 Basket:  Filter baskets shall be made of 3/16 in stainless steel, food grade wire for the circular elements and 1/8 in stainless steel, food grade wire for the handles, supporting circular elements, and radiating supports.  The coffee filter baskets shall have a top diameter of 19 1/4 in and a bottom diameter of 9 in with a depth of 4 1/2 in.  Each basket shall have a pair of handles, located opposite each other, for ease in moving the filter basket when filled with a coffee filter and grounds.  (d) NFES #0484 Stand:  The coffee urn stand shall be made of a minimum 16 gauge steel sheet metal.  The stand shall have a diameter of 16 1/8 in and a circumference of 51 in with a 1 in overlap spot weld.  The coffee urn stand has 13 holes, 2 3/8 in diameter, centered around it with 1 1/2 in spacing between each hole.  The edges shall be dulled for safe handling and it shall be painted with a heat-resistant Kelly-green color paint (Krylon Industrial Tough Coat #1470 OSHA green or equal).  (e) NFES #0485 Seating ring:  The coffee urn seating ring shall be made of a minimum 16 gauge steel sheet metal.  The seating ring shall have a diameter of 16 1/4 in with six metal tab extensions along the outside circumference, measuring 1 1/4 in by 3/4 in in size spot-welded to the outside perimeter with spacing of 6 3/4 in between each tab, except for the first tab.  The tab extensions are bent at a 90-degree angle so 3/8 in of each tab supports the seating ring over the jet burner and the coffee urn.  All metal edges on the seating ring shall be dulled and painted with a heat-resistant Kelly-green color paint (Krylon Industrial Tough Coat #1470 OSHA green or equal).  (f) NFES #0490 Windshield:  The windshield shall be made of 22 gauge cold rolled steel in a 31 in by 8 in sheet.  Sheets are rolled to fit outside of the coffee heating stove.  The stove is 16 1/2 in in diameter or 52 1/4 in in circumference.  Windshields shall consist of a rolled sheet and two 2 in by 1 3/4 in tabs spot welded 2 in from each end.  Tabs shall be crimped twice at 3/4 in and 1 5/8 in on the 2 in length to form a hook that will hang on the edge of the coffee heating stove.  The narrow side of the metal sheet (ends) shall be crimped inward at 52 degrees 3/8 in from each end.  All metal edges shall be dulled for safe handling.  The windshield shall be painted with a Kelly-green color paint (Krylon Industrial Tough Coat #1470 OSHA green or equal).  (g) NFES #0488 Stove:  (1) The base of the water heater stove measures approximately 16 1/2 in inside diameter and is recessed up from the bottom edge of the windshield by 11/16 in.  Two 1/4 in holes shall be drilled in the base.  The holes shall be positioned along a straight line dissecting the diameter of the base.  Each hole shall be centered and drilled 6 7/8 in from the outer edge.  This should place the center of the holes at a distance of 2 3/4 in from each other of 1 3/8 in from the center of the base.  This bolt pattern must match the bolt pattern from the burner assembly which is attached with two 3/16 in bolts.  (2) The windshield has three rows of holes, 26 per row, measuring approximately 1 in in diameter, centered around the windshield circumference with a 1 in horizontal spacing between each hole.  The top row of holes is positioned approximately 1 7/8 in from the top edge.  The second row is positioned 3 in and the third row positioned approximately 4 in from the top edge.  The windshield also has one row of 13 larger holes measuring 2 1/2 in in diameter positioned approximately 1 1/2 in from the bottom edge of the stove and centered around the circumference of the unit with approximately 1 1/2 in horizontal spacing between the holes.  A single 3/4 in diameter hole shall be positioned approximately 1 in from the bottom edge of the windshield.  This hole provides access from the burner assembly to the propane line attached outside the water heater stove component.  The hole must be positioned at 90 degrees on center to the line formed by the bolt-hole pattern on the base.  All hole edges shall be dulled for safe handling.  The top and bottom of the windshield and base shall be a rolled double hem edge that measures 1/4 in on the outside.  The rolled edge material on the top inside of the windshield measures approximately 11/16 in.  (3)  QUALITY.  The coffee urn components shall be made using standard commercially acceptable practices for working with stainless steel and sheet metal materials.  The completed units shall be free from defects in material and workmanship that would interfere with the performance of their intended function.  The units shall have no leaks and shall be acceptable for use in a food service operation.  (4)  DRAWINGS.
