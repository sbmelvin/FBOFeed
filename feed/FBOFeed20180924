<DESC>The Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC), Environmental Microbial &amp; Food Safety Laboratory (EMFSL), a component of the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) under The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), intends to&nbsp;issue on a sole source basis a fixed-price purchase order for the following: Hyperspectral Sensors; MicroHS2520 Shark &amp; MicroHS1410 Sensor manufactured by Corning &nbsp;in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 under simplified acquisition procedures to the following source; Corning Netoptix&nbsp;located in Keene, NH. This proposed award is being conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 333314; small business size standard is&nbsp;500 employees.
<p>Justification:<br />EMFSL requires compact hyperspectral imaging systems for food safety and environmental monitoring research. The suggested items; line-scan hyperspectral sensors are the only known sensors available that are suitable for fast moving and positioning for rapid food and environment monitoring. EMFSL requires sensors that are not bulky and heavy like traditional hyperspectral sensors because they cannot be used to develop compact and/or handheld systems. As such, the suggested items are made using a unique miniature solid block monolithic spectrograph design to make the smallest and lightest research-grade line-scan hyperspectral sensors on the market. Compared to other hyperspectral sensors, the required items&nbsp;which have similar spatial and spectral ranges and resolutions, are much smaller (5.4"&times;3.4"&times;2.8" for microHSI 410 SHARK and 5.0"&times;2.5"&times;2.4" for microHSI 410) and lighter (1.5 lb for microHSI 410 SHARK and 1.0 lb for microHSI 410).</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES However, it is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government. Vendors that believe they can provide the aforementioned items are invited to submit substantiating documentation in writing. The government will consider all responsible sources received by the due date. Written responses must contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona-fide capability to fulfill the requirement. If no written responses are received, a purchase order will be issued without further notice.</p>

Introduction:  
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other federal land management agencies have a long-term need to supply native plant materials for federal land management rehabilitation, restoration and reclamation efforts.  Common uses for native grass and forb seed include:  wildfire stabilization and rehabilitation, habitat improvement projects, revegetation of roads, reclamation of construction sites and other developments, mitigating erosion and sediment movement into streams, as well as the control and prevention of invasive plant species spread.  The National Seed Strategy (2015) Goal 1 is to ensure the reliable availability of genetically appropriate seed.  This IDIQ provides a Financial Instrument for the commercial seed industry that facilitates and streamlines meeting this native seed capacity goal.

Description of Work: 
The object of the multiple award IDIQ contracts are to procure source-identified seed, and increase seed originating from wildland collected seed sources into larger quantities required for stabilization, reclamation, rehabilitation and restoration projects on federal land.  Seed ordered under these contracts will be used by any Bureau of Land Management (BLM) office within the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.   All seed delivered to the Government shall be source identified (SI) certified native seed under the AOSCA certification program for Pre-Variety Germplasm (PVG).  

The Contractor shall provide all acreage, labor, supervision, equipment, tools, materials, supplies, facilities, fees, laboratory tests, seed certification, records, and transportation necessary to collect, cultivate and produce cleaned and tested native seed that meets crop and seed contract quality and quantity standards from species listed in the delivery orders.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) National Training Center (NTC) located at 9828 North 31st Avenue Phoenix, AZ 85051 seeks a contractor to develop an arid lands restoration and rehabilitation training program to improve the outcomes of on-the-ground restoration projects.
 
The full details of the training course development project are in the statement of work which is the attached file. 

There is one contract clause that will be added to the clauses of your contract. That is the Department of Interior (DOI) clause: Electronic Invoicing and Payment Requirements Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) (April 2013). This is because, for DOI, all payments must be made via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).
 
The course will be Section 508 compliant. The specifics of this are in the SOW. 
The course will be developed in modules. Prior to the beginning of the first module, the BLM and the contractor will have a voice conference call (kickoff meeting) to ensure that all personnel have an understanding of the modular approach and any and all other things associated with the project. 

The BLM will use milestone payments. The BLMs proposal for milestone payments is in the SOW. The BLM is open to discussion with the selected contractor for a different schedule of milestone payments. If a different schedule of milestone payments is agreed to between the BLM and the selected contractor, the decision will be documented by email traffic, between the BLM NTCs Contracting Officer (CO) and the contractors Manager.
 
This competition is being conducted using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Simplified Acquisition Procedures. 

The contractor will be selected by means of best value criteria. All evaluation criteria other than cost (price), excluding reference checks which, when combined are approximately equal to cost (price). For each quote received, each criteria other than price and reference checks will be assigned by the source selection committee a numerical score between 1 (lowest) and 10 (highest). The numerical scores will be summed and that will be the numerical score assigned each quote. That numerical score along with cost (price) and reference checks (go / no go) will be the deciding factors for source selection. That is: amongst all quotes that have passed reference checks, the total numerical score and price are the two factors that will be examined with the total numerical score being approximately equal to cost (price) as an evaluation factor. 

The best value criteria, in no particular order, are: 1) technical capability including demonstrated creativity in designing and producing distance learning courses. This will be demonstrated by samples of work posted on the contractor¿s website along with any samples of the contractors work that can be obtained by other means 2) capability of producing interactive quizzes. 3) having a project manager who can make a schedule of the contractors design proposal with that schedule having clearly identified tasks, who will do that task and what the tasks completion date is 4) having done previous course development work for federal government 5) demonstrated capability to produce products in Captivate 6) having an ISS (Instructional Systems Specialist) who has a demonstrated capacity to design courses 7) reference checks and 8) cost (price).
Quotes are accepted via GSAs website eBuy.gov, or through email to Mhesse@blm.gov
.
