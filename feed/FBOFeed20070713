<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)/Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), intends to contract with, on a sole source basis, the NC Foundation for Advanced Health Programs (NCFAHP).  This contract will be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 15 and 6.302-1.  The anticipated contract period is for a twelve (12) month base year with (2) twelve (12) month option years.  The purpose of this proposed contract is to support the coordination of recruitment efforts of the various organizations that recruit health professionals within the state (PCOs, PCAs, ORH, AHECs, etc.).  It will continue to support those states using Practice Sights with technical assistance and to provide the needed training and technical assistance to other states that have not yet had the opportunity to benefit from their use, but have expressed and interest to do so.   The NCFAHP is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the required services as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 because they developed and own Practice Sights Program which is protected under U.S. copyright laws.  It is designed for use in recruitment of health professionals for rural and underserved areas and is critical in performing these services.  It supports the recruitment of NHSC providers and for Federally Qualified Health Centers, Rural Health Clinics and other safety net providers.  Award of a contract to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government since other organizations would require establishment and set-up of a new system and would delay the implementation of this project.  This is not a solicitation but an announcement of the Government?s intent to contract on a sole source basis.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole-source contract extension to the INDUS Corporation pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA's GSFC) Information Technology and Communications Directorate (ITCD). This procurement is to extend Contract NAS5-02038 for a period of 9 months from August 31, 2007 through May 31, 2008 and increase the total CORE contract value.  ITCD is currently finalizing their technical requirements in order to go forward with the most efficient and effective set of technical requirements for follow-on to the current BASE contract. This extension is necessary to allow sufficient time for the competitive follow-on procurement.	This extension will allow for a continuation of current task orders issued, for modifications to existing task orders, and for new work until the competitive follow-on contract is awarded. The contract extension and total CORE contract value are necessary in order to ensure program continuity and mission critical support and to avoid significant technical impacts to the BASE program . The current Contractor provides the following mission critical services to NASA's GSFC ITCD: program management services; computer operations services; business infrastructure support services; application development, deployment, enhancement, and continuous support for business information systems; and sustaining engineering support.  INDUS Corporation, as the current incumbent, has the combined training, experience and expertise to provide uninterrupted continuation of mission critical support. Due to the time and substantial duplication of costs involved in procuring and phasing in another contractor, INDUS is considered the only contractor that can meet NASA's GSFC needs given the short period of performance for the extension. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 PM. local time on July 28, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

V.	EXTENT OF WORK

A.	GENERAL

The two-story L-shaped Dormitory Buildings 3 and 4 are almost identical except for their physical orientations and a basement in one-half of Building 4. Each floor consists of two dorm sleeping wings adjoining a center core where the lobby, lounges, laundry, mechanical room, etc., are located. The existing HVAC in both dormitory Buildings 3 and 4 are split system heat pumps with electric resistance supplementary heat. The supply air in the sleeping wings is ducted and routed in a furred down drywall bulkhead along the room side of the corridor walls. Supply air registers are mounted on the vertical face of the drywall bulkheads and return grilles and toilet exhaust grilles are on the bottom face of the same bulkhead. The return air is designed as a plenum system and is not ducted. The return air that enters the bulkhead flows through an opening with fire dampers into the corridor ceiling plenum. It then flows through a series of wall openings and plenums before arriving at the air handler in the mechanical room.

Two significant HVAC problems have been identified:  

?	Each sleeping wing is a multi-zoned area. In the current design, the entire floor in each sleeping wing was configured as a single HVAC zone and, each floor wing is provided with a single-zone HVAC system. The orientation and building exposure was not considered during design. Air handlers in both buildings are constant volume, single zone units. 
?	The second problem is the severely restrictive air distribution system.  The mechanical room, due to its location does not have adequate wall space for penetration and installation of all required HVAC ducts, plumbing pipes and electrical conduits that are routed to the room. 

The above problems have contributed to the unsatisfactory performance of the HVAC systems resulting in continuous complaints from the students and staff..

For purposes of this task, the general identification of the HVAC zones and their locations will be as follows: Buildings 3 and 4 are both L-shaped and are identical in design in the sleeping wings. In each building, the two dorm sleeping wings meet at the core which is at the center of the ?L?. The building entrances are also a part of the core. 

Example 1: Zone 3-LF1 represents Building 3 - Left Front Wing, First Floor  Zone 3-LB1 represents Wing 3 ? Left Back (Rear) Wing Building 1.  It should be assumed that the corridor separates the front side from the back side in each wing.  

There is a total of 8 HVAC zones in the sleeping area in each building.  On the first floor in Men?s Dormitory Building 3, there are zones 3-LF1, 3-LB1, 3-RF1 and 3-RB1. On the second floor, there are zones 3-LF2, 3-3LB2, 3-RF2 and 3-RB2.  Similarly, on the first floor in Women?s Dormitory Building 4, there are zones 4-LF1, 4-LB1, 4-RF1 and 4-RB1. On the second floor, there are zones 4-LF2, 4-3LB2, 4-RF2 and 4-RB2. Regard the wing corridor as a part of the Front zone at each floor.

B.	PROGRAMMATIC REQUIREMENTS

C.	ARCHITECTURAL
Architectural work is not required except where incidental to the work described below.  Furr all new ductwork locations as required and paint the new wallboard.

D.	STRUCTURAL
Structural work is not required except where incidental to the work described below.

E.	ROOFING WORK
Roofing work is not required except where incidental to the work described below.

F.	PLUMBING
Plumbing work is not required except where incidental to the work described below.

G.	ELECTRICAL
Provide all electrical work in accordance with NEC and DOL Publication JCH 814.  Provide suitable electrical connections for all new mechanical equipment and required electrical devices and interlocks. 

H.	HEATING, VENTILATING, AIR CONDITIONING
Phase 1:
Perform test and balance of the existing HVAC system including the air distribution in Buildings 3 and 4.  The test data shall be complete and must include actual air flow (supply, return and exhaust) in each space, and each room served by the system must be identified.  The system control settings and the outdoor condition during the tests shall be recorded. Also measure the return air flow at the transfer openings between plenums above the ceiling. Equipment shall be identified and related data and performance information provided.  Submit 3 copies of the Test, Adjusting and Balance report.

Phase 2:
Remove the existing split system heat pump units (outdoor and indoor) that serve the dorm sleeping wings. Replace with 4-ton split system heat pump units such that each of the 16 new zones in both buildings is served by one constant volume heat pump system. Each indoor air handler is to be provided with 14 kW electric resistance supplementary heat.  Refrigerant used in the split heat pump system shall be R-410A.  Refrigerant piping shall have a rubberized insulation.  All heat pump system components must be compatible with refrigerant 410A. Reuse the existing ductwork where suitable, and provide modification where necessary. Provide outside air to each of the new air handlers. Each outside air duct shall be insulated and shall have an adjustable manual damper. Locate the outdoor units on the existing concrete pad at the back of the building. Extend the concrete pad as necessary.  Locate the indoor heat pump units in the existing mechanical room.  If additional mechanical space is required to achieve better airflow and to improve access to duct connections, a portion of the storage room adjacent to the mechanical room could be utilized.  In each zone, locate a temperature sensor in a return air path in a representative room.  Locate a remote thermostat in the RA office. Provide air balance.  Provide a secondary drain pan and adequately routed condensate drain piping pan for each indoor unit.  Indoor condensate drain piping must connect indirectly to floor drains.  Where it is impractical to utilize gravity condensate drains, provide condensate pumps.

The 2-bed room adjacent to the stairs at the end of each dorm wing has a toilet exhaust system which, like others, is required to be terminated outdoors. Check each such end room (total 8: Rooms A18, B18, A28 and B28 in Bldg. 3; Rooms C18, D18, C28 and D28 in Bldg. 4) for adequate functioning and proper termination of the toilet exhaust system. Where the existing exhaust duct from such end room is not properly connected to a functioning centralized exhaust system, provide a duct extension (6? x 4?) from the toilet exhaust fan through the exterior wall and terminate outdoors with a backdraft damper wall cap.

<CONTACT>Anh Le Anh.Le@Hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The Tactical Air Control Party Modernization Program seeks to design, develop, integrate, test, produce and prepare associated documentation, fabricate, integrate, test, provide logistic support, provide technical support, provide field service support as necessary, provide training, develop technical manuals and deliver the Vehicular Communications System (VCS). The U.S. Air Force (USAF) requires the capabilities provided by Tactical Air Control Parties (TACP) and their VCS components that support numerous critical functions across the battlespace.  TACPs advise the ground commander and staff on aerospace power capabilities and assist them in planning close air support (CAS) operations. TACPs provide USAF Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures expertise and a focal point for detailed air CAS integration with ground force fire and maneuver.  In order to perform their mission, TACPs must employ vehicle mounted communications systems, manpack radios, and digital communications devices that enable them to be interoperable with the Army Digitized Battlefield. The VCS, a subsystem of the overall TACP-M system, is the key element in providing mobile, on the move communication and data protocol interoperability required to effectively operate throughout the battlespace. Using different communications systems at the various ground force echelons and between various aircraft and C2 nodes requires the VCS to be equipped with communications capabilities that support multiple waveforms and data protocols. Although data operations are increasing on the battlefield, allowing for faster and more accurate mission execution, voice communications will continue to be required to augment and coordinate the data operations.

<DESC>***THIS NOTICE IS BEING POSTED AS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION 5.203(2)***

The General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement for a full range of multi-channel contact center services.  This requirement represents a re-solicitation of the multi-channel contact center services originally solicited under GSA Request for Proposal GSV07PD0003.

Request for Proposal GSV07PD0003 has been cancelled.  The reason that solicitation was cancelled is because the Government has determined that the minimum experience requirements, cited in Section L.7.2.1.3.1, are overly restrictive.  Cancellation of the original solicitation and re-issuance of the new solicitation is taken to comply with the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.206(e).

Although this is a re-issuance of a previous requirement, all potential offerors, including offerors who submitted a proposal under the original solicitation, are expected to carefully review the complete set of General Instructions for Preparation of a Proposal, Section L.7 of the revised solicitation, because changes, other than changes to the minimum experience requirements, have been made.

Offerors, who provided a timely and otherwise responsive offer to the original solicitation, and chose not to make any changes to their proposal in response to the revised solicitation, are not required to submit a new proposal.  They do, however, need to submit a letter on company letterhead, signed by an individual who was authorized to submit the proposal in response to the original solicitation, stipulating that the entire proposal submitted in response to the original solicitation, represents their entire proposal in response to the revised solicitation, and the this proposal remains in full force and effect.

All offerors who submitted a proposal in response to the original solicitation, who?s proposal is not in accordance with General Instructions for Preparation of Proposal of the revised solicitation, or offerors that chose to made changes to their proposal submitted in response to the original solicitation must, as must all new offerors, submit a proposal in full accordance with instructions in remainder of Section L.7 of the revised solicitation.  

Offerors who provided a proposal under the original solicitation and who are providing a new proposal under the revised solicitation are requested to identify all changes with a vertical line in the right hand margin of the page.

Offerors, who provided a timely and otherwise responsive offer to the original solicitation, and chose not to make any changes to their proposal in response to solicitation GSV07PD0007, are not required to submit a new proposal.

All offerors who submitted a proposal in response to solicitation GSV07PD0003, whose proposal is not in accordance with General Instructions for Preparation of Proposal of that solicitation, or offerors that chose to made changes to their proposal submitted in response to solicitation GSV07PD0003 must, as must all new offerors, submit a proposal in full accordance with instructions in remainder of Section L.7 of solicitation GSV07PD0007.

<DESC>Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) Acquisition and Procurement Office (A&PO) is planning to award a contract to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.  Only firms that are Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses should apply.  These firms should have current, relevant qualifications, experience, personnel, and capability to construct a smoke control system.
The Pentagon Renovation and Construction Program (PENREN) "Alt Sites" team is responsible for the Planning, Design, Construction and Project Management of major renovation and upgrade to the Under Ground Facility (UGF) and site to support its Mission. 
This UGF and site has been in existence since the early 1950's and has continued in operation. A needs assessment was completed, and the resulting information generated a necessity to provide more effective method of smoke control. The existing methods available for smoke control are not automated. An upgraded system is needed to improve the methods for dealing with a fire emergency and improve life safety during the course of such an event.
Design and build a system which would inhibit the flow of smoke into areas of egress, corridors, stairwells and the inner roadway. It would be activated automatically during the early stages of a fire to compartmentalize the smoke and to maintain a survivable environment, e.g. contain the smoke in the fire zone of origin, especially for those personnel evacuating from the more remote corridors and offices. The smoke control system would function during the period of personnel evacuation from the areas protected by the system. Moreover, this system would facilitate search and rescue operations by emergency response personnel. 
This project will create compartmentalized smoke control zones at minimum, coordinated with the fire zones, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) controls throughout the site. The system would provide the capability to automatically or manually operate fans, dampers and doors to protect egress areas during an emergency such as a fire. A 1998 Smoke Control Design by Nutec is available as a reference document upon request. This document is not up to date and should not be relied upon as completely accurate. Contractor is responsible for verifying any information taken from this document.
In accordance with FAR 36.206, the estimated magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Due to the sensitive nature of the work location, prospective contractors are required to possess an active facility clearance.  The geographic location where the work is to be performed is in southern Pennsylvania near the Maryland border.
DO NOT REQUEST SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS UNTIL THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL IS ISSUED.     The proposed solicitation number will be HQ0034-07-R-0005 and will be issued on or about 30 July 2007. A copy of the solicitation can be obtained from www.FedBizOpps.gov.     Proposals will be due approximately 30 days later on or about 30 August 2007. Award is expected to be made on or about 29 September 2007. For any inquiried, please contact Randall Jewett, Contract Administrator, via email: randall.jewett.ctr@whs.mil ; telephone number 703-695-3799, fax number 703-614-6329.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), code 5600, has been tasked to provide support of support of at sea testing of FSF-1 SEAFIGHTER (X-Craft) has created a requirement for technical and engineering support services.  NSWCCD intends to negotiate a competitive procurement with vendors. This is a non-recurring engineering service for purchase of three Model PF-1U-16FA-HP4F/LP4FP-Z-M103, 16- channel Filter Amplifier systems with power supply, control and GUL. The PF-1U-16FA is a 16-channel filter/amplifier and the PF-1U-8FA filter/amplifier is an 8-channel, both offering a choice of either 4 or 8-pole low-pass filters or 8-pole band-pass filters. Cutoff settings from 1 Hz to 204.6 kHz are supported. The low-pass filters may operate in either a flat mode for maximally flat pass-band amplitude response with sharp roll-off or in a pulse mode for low phase distortion and optimized transient response.  The flat mode provides pass-band characteristics nearly identical to a Butterworth filter while providing a much sharper roll-off. This mode is a good choice for applications such as spectral analysis. The pulse mode has time domain response similar to the Bessel filter yet provides superior amplitude response characteristics. The pulse mode is ideal for time domain applications including transient (shock) measurements and time domain waveform analysis. Programmable pre- and post-filter amplifiers provide an overall gain of 2048. Gain is distributed both before and after the filter to provide protection from large out-of-band energy or transients that could cause clipping before the filter, distorting the data. The post-filter gain has resolution of better than 0.05% to enable system scaling of the outputs to match the full-scale input of the external recording device. Overload detectors alert the user to over-voltage conditions. Precise, automated digital calibration of gain and DC offset are provided. Other features of the PF-1U-FA include a test input for injection of calibration signals into the channel input and a monitor output that allows for convenient monitoring of any channel output via a single BNC.  The system includes an Ethernet remote interface and is supplied with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for local control. Non-Recurring Engineering for M103 Modification  M103 modification replaces the 4 poles HP filter with a single pole HP filter cutoffs between 1 HZ and 100kHz. Interested person may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not request for competitive proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responsible sources submitting proposals within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Anticipated award date is on or around 8/27/07.  Interested parties may forward capabilities statements to the point of contract by no later than 8/13/07

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), intends to procure genotyping services using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers from deCODE Genetics, Sturlugata 8, 101 Reykjavik, Iceland.  The Institute intends to purchase this service by other than full and open competition under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302. To the best of the Government?s knowledge, deCODE Genetics is the only vendor we are aware of that offers this service.  deCODE genetics is successful at extracting results from family data with small sample sizes. 

The service includes using random genome wide scan genotyping at 2Cm average resolution using deCODE Genetics 2000 highly polymorphic Marker Microsatellite set. This service will allow the Lab to identify genes that cause keloids in 6 families that the Lab has already recruited beginning in 2001 under Protocol 01-DK-0062.  Since that time over 90 DNA samples have been collected for linkage analysis.

We have 6 families that range in size from 6 to 22 members depending on the family.  There is a possibility that the genetic defect causing keloids is different in each family so the approach taken for DNA analysis becomes very important. 


This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient details to allow NIDDK to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements.  Offers must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties and/or other information that demonstrates that the offer meets all of the foregoing requirements.   Offerors may request a copy of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) in writing or by FAX to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.  It is anticipated that the RFQ NIH-NIDDK-07-303 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication of this synopsis.  Receipts of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.   If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Tina Robinson via email. All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Tina Robinson @ robinsti@mail.nih.gov or faxed (301) 480-7443.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call 301-402-8778 and verify that questions were received.  A determination to compete or not compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. PLEASE NOTE:   In order to receive an award from the NIDDK, contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov  in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has a sole source requirement for programming personnel and resources to manage the Vaccine Research Center's (VRC) long-term comprehensive data management plan for its Clinical Trials Core.  The goals of the data management plan are: 1. to enable the VRC to rapidly and efficiently analyze the results of vaccine clinical trials following study completion; 2. permit frequent reviews of interim safety and accrual data during conduct of a clinical trial; and 3. to meet Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR312) requirements, for the proper conduct of the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the Investigational New Drug applications for new vaccine products.  On, or about 10/1/2007, the NIAID Acquisitions Management Operations Branch (AMOB) intends to award a sole source contract, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for data management support to the EMMES Corporation of Rockville, MD.  This contract award will be for a one-year period of performance, and will also contain the provision at FAR 52-217.8 for the consideration of four additional option years of performance. The EMMES Corporation using its proprietary data collection software has performed as the sole compiler of and processor of all VRC Clinical Trials repository data.  This data includes patient enrollment, clinical evaluations, treatment records, adverse events data, subject status, and other study-specific clinical evaluations as required for reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the other regulatory agencies that oversee human clinical trials.  Current Phase I/II domestic and international clinical trials that have been initiated using the EMMES data collection platforms must be completed using the same protocols to preserve the integrity of data and the trials' utility for ultimate licensure of prospective candidate vaccines.  It is not possible to transfer these trials' data management functions to another contractor without re-starting the clinical trials from their inception - a step that would severely harm the Government's investment in time, resources, and funds in the development processes to achieve an effective vaccine treatment for a number of emerging infectious diseases including HIV/AIDs.  To the extent possible, EMMES will continue to use validated software and existing data management platforms established for the VRC Clinical Trials Core to facilitate the VRCs on-going programmatic needs - making minimal system customizations as necessary to meet current rules and regulations of Good Clinical Practice as established by the FDA and Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR312).  Please refer any questions in writing to LaDonna Stewart at lstewart@niaid.nih.gov by 2:00 pm EDT, August 27, 2007.  See numbered note 22.

The current contract will be modified to provide additional acceptance and testing of glass and quarts filters.  BACKGROUND:  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina is responsible for procuring, testing, and distributing filters of high purity to the State/local air pollution control agencies. The quartz filters are used with a size selective sampler (SSI) to collect PM-10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) samples.  The glass fiber filters are used with a Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) sampler.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks. EPA obtains the filters each year from TRC Environmental, Corp and has them shipped to EPA for acceptance testing. The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution to the States.  If the acceptance testing confirms that the filters meet EPAs specifications for physical and chemical properties, the EPA distributes the filters to the State/local air pollution control agencies.   THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING TASKS:  I.  Glass and Quartz Fiber Filter Selection and Testing - The Contractor shall use the following test methods to check the filters. a.  American Society of Testing Methods (ASTM) Method D645-92 (Standard Test Method for Thickness of Paper and Paperboard) b.  Brittleness Test for Hi-Volume Glass Fiber Filters c.  Tensile Tests for Hi-Vol Filters d.  ASTM Method D828-93 (Tensile Properties of Paper and Paperboard Using Constant-Rate-of-Elongation Apparatus with Attachment for Use on Hi-Vol Filters) e.  Determination of Organic Content of Glass Fiber Filters (EMSL/RTP-SOP-QAD-522) f.   EMSL/EPA/RTP Hi Vol Filter Flow Rate Acceptance Test for Quartz Filters for the SSI Samplers g.  Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory (AREAL)  Visual Inspection Test for Quartz and Glass Fiber Filters h.  ASTM Method D2986-91 (Standard Practice for Evaluation of Air Assay Media by the Monodisperse DOP (Dioctyl Phthalate) Smoke Test i.  Reference Method for the Determination of Lead in Suspended Particulate Matter Collected from Ambient Air (40 CFR, Part 50, Appendix G), or equivalent.   II.  .  Glass Fiber Filters - The Contractor shall test 375 filters from each batch of glass fiber filters, where a batch is defined as the filters to be used in one calendar year, for acceptance testing by the physical and chemical test described below.  All 375 filters shall be subjected to the visual inspection and then a certain quantity (specified in chart) shall be subjected to the other tests described below. a..	Physical Properties - The number of filters to be tested and the physical properties to be measured are given below: (SEE CHART AND TEXT PUBLISHED AT THE EPA WEB SITE REFERENCED BELOW) b.	Chemical Properties: a) Lead Content.  No filter from a total of 50 filters shall contain more than 0.25 micrograms of lead when the filter is analyzed as per the EPA Reference Test Method for Lead 40 CFR 50. III.  Quartz Fiber Filters - 475 filters from each batch of quartz fiber filters, where a batch is defined as the filters to be used in one calendar year, shall be selected for acceptance testing by the physical tests described below.  All  filters shall be subjected to the visual inspection test and then a certain number shall be subject to the other tests described below. a).	Physical Properties -The number of filters to be tested and the physical properties to be measured are given below: (SEE CHART AND TEXT PUBLISHED AT THE EPA WEB SITE REFERENCED BELOW) IV.  Distribution - After the acceptance testing is completed on the filters, the contractor shall distribute approximately 22,000 glass fiber filters and approximately 76,000 quartz filters as soon as the testing has been completed and the filters are determined to be acceptable to EPA. After the CY-2007 filters are distributed, it is anticipated that approximately 5,400 glass and 23,400 quartz filters remain.  The contractor shall store the remaining filters until the PO notifies the Contractor in writing to (a) send to State/local agencies whose filters were damaged in shipment; and (b) ship approximately 22,000 glass fiber filters and approximately 67,000 quartz filters to State/local agencies approximately September 2007.  The contractor shall also store the remaining filters from this mail-out. The glass fiber and quartz filters shall be shipped by the contractor after transferring the appropriate number of filter boxes from the manufacturers shipping cases to boxes provided by the contractor for distribution of the filters to the State/local air pollution control agencies nationwide.  The contractor shall never ship a partial box, and the smallest quantity of filters to be shipped to any location shall be one box.  EPA will provide the contractor a master letter and copies of the letter to include one copy in each shipment to the agencies. If a State/local agency receives the filters from the Contractor in a condition where contamination is suspected due to a shipping mishap and the Contractor is notified, the Contractor shall immediately notify EPA to get written consent to ship another set of filters to the participant. V.  Deliverables A.	The contractor shall submit all test results to the EPA within 5 days after completing the accepting testing procedures. B.	The contractor shall ship the filters to the designated State/local agencies within 5 days after notification. C.	The contractor shall store the remaining filters for up to 24 months. VI.  Option to Extend the Term of the Contract  The Government has the option to exercise the optional requirement.  If more than 365 days remain in the contract period of performance, the Government, without prior written notification, may exercise this option by issuing a contract modification.  To exercise this option within the last 365 days of the period of performance, the Government must provide to the Contractor written notification prior to that last 365 day period.  This preliminary notification does not commit the Government to exercising the option.  Use of an option will result in the following modifications: (a) The Period of Performance will be extended; (b)During the option period, the Contractor shall provide the services as described in the Statement of Work; (c) The payment clause will be amended to reflect increased fixed price for the optional services. VII.  Payment Schedule Payment 1 - The contractor shall be paid  ______ after acceptance testing is completed. Payment 2 - The contract shall be paid  _______ after the first mailing. Payment 3 - The contractor shall be paid  ______ after the second mailing EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with TRC Environmental Corporation, Chapel Hill, NC for the above services for continuity of the current contract.  EPA obtains these filters each year from TRC Environmental and has them shipped to EPA for acceptance testing and storage.  The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution to the States.  EPA has only 90 days to accept or reject the filters once received.  Therefore, the services are deemed to be available only from the original source for the continued provision of highly specialized services.  If the acceptance testing confirms that the filters meet EPA's specifications for physical and chemical properties, the contractor shall ship the filters to the State/local air pollution control agencies.   The base performance period is for twelve months with two additional optional periods of 12 months each.  The place of performance is at the contractor's site. Any subsequent amendments or status may be viewed at EPA's web site:  http:www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Hard copies, CDs or disketts are not be available.

Dear Interested Parties,

This is to inform you that the USAID is seeking sources from individuals and organizations for Market Based Partnerships Assessment in the health arena in India. 

Services of two specialists is envisioned: one private sector specialist with corporate and marketing experience and an understanding of development issues and public health; and another public health specialist with in-depth understanding of public health issues in India and an understanding of private sector approaches to health care. Both specialists will work with USAID/India to undertake an assessment of the commercial private sector and identify areas of possible public-private partnerships in health that will complement USAID/India?s programs and accelerate the pace of their achievement. The private sector consultant will lead the two-person team. The consultants will work with USAID/India to:
1) Explore new private sector opportunities for market-based partnerships that help in delivering better public health outcomes.
2) Gauge the private commercial sector capacity, interest and motivation for initiating PPP models in health.
3) Assess whether the potential partnerships will be viable for bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) and rural markets in USAID priority states.
4)Provide specific recommendations to USAID/India for overall approaches and technical strategies for market-based partnerships for delivering better health outcomes. This will include a list of potential partners with illustrative areas for partnerships.

USAID/India is interested in identifying potential partnerships that are not driven by pure philanthropy or corporate social responsibility. Instead, USAID/India seeks partnerships that are ground in business and have the potential to cater to BOP and rural markets. The idea here is to harness the private sector channels that already exist for delivering public health information, products and/or services to generate demand and improve access and/or quality.

USAID/India will be provide further information and complete solicitation package (RFQ) directly to all interested parties that identify themselves as a result of this notice. Please respond at IndiaRCO@usaid.gov with a cc to rwalia@usaid.gov no later than 1000 hours (New Delhi time) on July 30, 2007.  A copy of this notice is also posted at USAID/India website http://www.usaid.gov/in under the working with us link.  

						Sincerely,

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   RFQ-OH-07-00149, for the Technical Support Services for Calculating Metrics that Characterize the Sustainability of the San Luis Basin, Colorado will be issued on Monday, July 16, 2007.  If a contractor is interested in receiving the RFQ for this EPA requirement they must submit a request via email for RFQ-OH-07-00149 to Scott Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov.  A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  The performance period will be 13 months from the date of award of the firm fixed price purchase order. The EPA estimated  420 labor hours will be needed to complete this requirement.  This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541990, size standard $6.5 million.  The synopsis for this EPA requirement is as follows: Over 50% of the land base in EPA Region 8 is publicly owned; much of it  by the federal government, and many of the environmental management responsibilities of EPA Region 8 involve public lands.  Over the long-term, the maintenance of intact and sustainable regional ecosystems depends on the ability of all land-owning neighbors to manage and utilize their land in a  sustainable manner. Under the guidance of two Executive Orders, the EPA has been tasked by Congress to provide direction and assistance to Federal agencies to help them comply.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Zeiss Stereo Discovery V20 Microscope
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NB831040-7-05636
<RESPDATE>072707
<ARCHDATE>08112007
<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Fax 301-975-8884, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Joan Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone (301)975-6458, Fax (301)975-8884, Email Joan.Smith@nist.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc. in Thornwood, New York for the purchase of a Zeiss Stereo Discovery V20 Microscope under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

NIST requires this microscope to provide a platform for assembling microfluidic devices and observing fluid flow and cell behavior.  For NISTs particular applications a stereo/macro microscope is required because of a variable zoom, long objective working distance, wide field of view, and ready access to the experimental device.  Specific requirements include:
1.	Very large zoom range (20x) to cover imaging of an entire microfluidic chip (40mm x 30 mm) down to details of cells within single channels (500 micrometers);
2.	Flatness of the viewing field is required.  NIST requires a 0.63x objective on a 20x zoom range, which takes the field of view from 48 mm to 2.4 mm;
3.	Ability to upgrade to higher magnification/numerical aperture objectives, e.g. 1x, 1.5x, 2.3x, and 3.5x (high NA macro);
4.	Stereo imaging to facilitate 3D visualization of objects during device alignment;
5.	Ability to upgrade from stereo to single optical axis design (macro), which has nearly twice the numerical aperture, for applications which require increased sensitivity and resolution such as fluorescence imaging;
6.	Ability to upgrade the microscope for fluorescence illumination;
7.	Numerous illumination schemes (transmitted and reflected/oblique, brightfield, darkfield, and polarization) and contrast adjustments are critical to enhancing contrast of specific areas within the transparent device.  NIST requires dual gooseneck fibers and a ring-light for reflected illumination and illumination through base for transmitted light;
8.	The scope must have high working distance (greater than 50 mm) to fit devices under the objective;
9.	The head must allow imaging through a separate port (digital camera attachments);
10.	The base must have a large, flat working surface to hold the devices and support materials (150 mm x 150 mm or larger);
11.	We require upgradability to computer controlled zoom and focus for programmable acquisition of multiple fields.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that Carl Zeiss MicroImaging is the only firm that provides:  
1.	Wide (20x) zoom range;
2.	0.63 objective on a 20x zoom range;
3.	Widest available range of Plan Apo objectives;
4.	Option to upgrade from stereo to single optical axis design;
5.	Best illumination and contrast control options (based on a light source options, mirrors, polarizers, and 3-axis control of the base illuminator);
6.	Motorized zooming already integrated into their product.
 		
Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within six (6) weeks after receipt of order.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 5:00 p.m. (EST) on July 27, 2007.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), Natural Products Branch (NPB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with World Botanical Associates, The University of Illinois at Chicago, New York Botanical Gardens, and Missouri Botanical Gardens for plant collections in the following areas:  1)  Arid lands in the SW of the USA and Hawaiian endemic species;  2)  SE Asia, in particular the Indochina Peninsula (Vietnam and Laos);  3)  the Caribbean (Lesser and if necessary, the Greater Antilles) and from Micronesia;  4)  West Africa (Gabon and the Central African Republic); and 5)  High altitude medicinal plants from Tibet and contiguous areas. DTP/NPB has had a collection program related to plant sources since 1986.  These procurements will enable the process to continue with fresh materials as current backlogs of plant materials are being worked up.  The contractors shall collect a significant number of previously uncollected plant specimens over a one year period of performance, with the aim of increasing the NPBs knowledge of previously uncollected materials World-wide.  The plants will be collected utilizing the tenets of the NCI?s Letter of Collection (LOC) and /or existing Memoranda of Understanding (MOU).  These are well known documents to the proposed collection contractors all of whom have used one or both in previous collections for the NCI. In almost all cases, the potential countries in whose lands we propose to collect are also very familiar with the documents.  Such documents are an absolute requirement due to the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD).  These documents substitute in all of the proposed areas of collection as the proposed collectors have been using these or very similar documents for prior NCI collections and have the necessary established political and scientific connections in the source countries.  Air-dried plant samples of ~ 1 kilogram dry weight, which depending upon the size of the plant may be single or multiple samples from any one organism, together with taxonomic information, location details and voucher specimens, shall be delivered to the Natural Products Repository in Frederick, MD.  Electronic submission of source and taxonomic data will be made via a secure web-link by each collection group and details of testing of the samples will be provided back to the source countries via NCI and the collectors.  In order to collect plant samples that can then be evaluated for their potential to produce agents that may lead to novel drug sources against cancer, both within and outside US territories, one requires an extremely skilled and experienced botanists who has/have extensive collection experience in the areas of the World that are of interest.  All of the proposed suppliers have extensive experience in dealing with the source countries suggested since they have made earlier collections for the NCI in those countries.   They have the processes in place, and know with whom to negotiate in the source country governmental entities for permission to collect and export.  To the NCI Researcher?s knowledge there are no other organizations that have the necessary botanical and logistical experience to perform the collections in the political climates that exist in the proposed collection areas.   This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. Statement of capabilities should provide evidence that your organization has dealt with these countries and can obtain permission to collect and export with in 60 days of award.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a solicitation to obtain the services of experienced, licensed PSYCHOLOGISTS, who have SSA disability program experience at the State and/or Federal level, to serve as Medical Experts (ME) to analyze and provide expert advice related to their specialized field, as needed, so that adjudicators can render accurate determinations and decisions.  

BACKGROUND:  SSA is responsible for two national disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  SSA uses a five-step sequential process for evaluating the disability claim submitted by an individual who alleges an inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA).  The program defines disability as an inability to engage in SGA by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  A medical basis for the disability claim is required, and the State disability determination services (DDS) collect and evaluate the medical information, making a determination about the severity of the medical and/or psychiatric or psychological impairment as it relates to the claimant?s ability to perform SGA.  

While many disability impairments may be properly evaluated by medical generalists, claims that involve difficult or complex issues require medical and/or psychiatric/psychological specialist and sub-specialist expertise.
 
SSA anticipates the award of one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with provisions for the issuance of Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) task orders as needed. The IDIQ period of performance will be for an 8-month base period, with four 12-month option periods. SSA?s estimated date for release of the solicitation is on/about July 14, 2007, of which proposals will be due approximately 20 days from the date of release. Any amendments or other information relative to the solicitation will be posted to this website (www.fedbizopps.gov).  As such, interested sources are encouraged to REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION.  Hard copies of the solicitation and any related information will NOT be provided.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All questions must be submitted via email to dawn.caracci@ssa.gov.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>KATHLEEN SAGE, Contract Specialist, (973)724-2564
<DESC>Synopsis for the 50mm EAPS cannon The U.S. Army, Picatinny N.J.,is considering awarding a Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contract on a Sole Source basis to Alliant TechSystems Inc., Medium Caliber Systems Division, 3309 N. Reseda Circle, Mesa, AZ 85215-9103 for the procurement of one 50mm prototype cannon in support of the Extended Area Protection and Survivability, EAPS, Program.  ATK has been instrumental in developing the Chain Gun concept for automatic cannons across the caliber range from 25mm to 50mm. They have developed a hybrid cannon which would fire the EAPS ammunition, have a firing rate of 200 shots per minute and be capable of firing 3-round bursts.  ATK has the ability to provide  this unique and innovative concept and capability to provide the 50mm prototype cannon utilizing propriatary technology. The objective of this task is the procurement of one (1) each 50mm prototype  cannon to support testing and demonstrations planned for the Extended Area  Protection and Survivability (EAPS) Advanced Technology Objective (ATO)  Program.  EAPS is an air defense program aimed at developing a medium caliber  cannon based system capable of shooting Rockets, Artillery and Mortar (RAM)  rounds out of the air.  An extensive one year systems analysis was conducted  by the Systems Engineering Directorate which concluded that a 50mm cannon  firing at rates of 200-250 shots per minute was the optimal caliber and firing  rate.  Preliminary ammunition design and analysis efforts indicated that a course correcting projectile housed in a 50mm x 533mm cartridge was the  optimal design envelope.  Test and demonstration plans for the EAPS program  require firing single shots as well as 3-round bursts of ammunition.  Delivery  of an automatic cannon that meets these program requirements is needed by  30 Sep 08 to meet scheduled test and demonstration milestones. The POC is Kathleen A. Sage, 973-724-2564, e-mail ksage@pica.army.mil. See Note 22.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation. THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION IS ATTACHED; NO FURTHER SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) located in Seattle, WA intends to acquire services to collect samples for stable isotope analysis from approximately 50 streams throughout the John Day Basin.  Stable isotopes are becoming a vital tool to answer important questions about the ecology and conservation of threatened and endangered species.  Stable isotopes are useful for informing about the diets of threatened and endangered species, where these taxa function in food webs and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on these species.  Because of the valuable insights provided from stable isotope analysis, the Northwest Fisheries Science Center would like to begin including isotope monitoring in watershed monitoring programs.  We wish to add this type of monitoring to one current monitoring program.  This project will function as a pilot program in that results from these efforts will be used to determine the value of adding stable isotope monitoring to other intensive watershed program monitoring projects throughout the Northwest.  The NWFSC is currently managing a large-scale intensive monitoring program in the John Day Basin.  The statement of work outlines a stable isotope monitoring plan for this basin. The period of performance is through 30 September 2008. ALL PROPOSALS RECEIVED WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS SYNOPSIS WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206) 527-7115 attention to Mona Ash.   ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation. THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION IS ATTACHED; NO FURTHER SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is required to periodically assess the status of marine mammal populations in waters under U.S. jurisdiction per the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA).  The SWFSC in La Jolla, CA intends to acquire services to improve information beaked whale diving behavior, near-shore distribution, movements, and population structure around the Hawaiian Islands.  Population size and trends in population size are some of the most valuable data used for this purpose. Large-scale ship surveys were conducted in 2002 around the Hawaiian Islands; however, there is no data on beaked whale diving in this area on which to base abundance correction factors. There is also no information on the movement patterns of beaked whales in this area.  In addition to general population assessment, NMFS has a mandate to monitor and mitigate human-caused impacts on marine mammal population. Recently, the strandings of beaked whales has been associated with loud anthropogenic sounds, such as military sonar.  NMFS is working with the U.S. Navy to determine what factors are involved in causing these strandings. Lack of knowledge about the normal diving behavior of beaked whales is an impediment to understanding the cause of strandings.  The statement of work outlines the tasks, methodologies, specifications and standards, deliverables, and technical evaluation factors.  The period of performance is through 1 October 2008.  ALL PROPOSALS RECEIVED WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS SYNOPSIS WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF LESS THAN $100,000. All responses must be in writing and may be faxed to (206) 527-7115 attention to Mona Ash.   ****The Western Regional Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

This project replaces the remote monitoring  and control system, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for  the primary electrical power distribution system located at WPAFB. This  system consists of power sensors, relays, remote terminal units, and the  interconnecting control conductors in 9 substations located throughout the  base. It also consists of a front end computer system located in one  central facility along with other remote monitoring sites. This project  requires very specialized equipment and computer programming to result in  a fully functional SCADA system.  The SCADA system monitors the entire  primary electrical distribution system, and allows for complete control of  that system. The scope will also include associated architectural, civil,  structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and miscellaneous work as  shown on the project drawings and described in the specifications. NAICS  Code 238210 Size Standard $13.0 Million. The overall estimated price range  is between $1M and $5M. Period of Performance is 365 days.

Specifications and drawings  previously posted were for information only. NOTES: The solicitation, specifications and drawings will be available on  the World Wide Web on or about 18 July 2007, at  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. PRESOLICITATION NOTICE for FA8601-07-R-0045, Project Number ZHTV 050033B,  Repair 2nd Floor Fire Suppression/HVAC-Phase II ABW HQ , Facility 30010,  Area C,  WPAFB.  Period of Performance is 365 days. The overall estimated  price range is between $ 1M and $ 5M. The solicitation is an unrestricted  acquisition, full-and-open competition. In accordance with DFARS  252.204-704 Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), Contractor  must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished  at http://www.ccr2000.com/index.cfm, or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax:  1-703-696-0213. SCOPE OF WORK:  This project renovates the interior and installs fire  suppression that doesnt currently exist.  It includes complete  replacement of the HVAC and electrical systems.  The fire alarm is so  outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The requirement  for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The renovation will  correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room with inadequate  egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient  use of space. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors. NOTES: 1.

<DESC>The solicitation is now available at www.neco.navy.mil under solicitation number N0018907RZ052.


This requirement was previously synopsized as N624020062088 (23 August 2006), as a service disabled veteran owned small business set-aside (SDVOSB).  The synopsis was subsequently cancelled by amendment dated 06 September 2006 due to a challenge by SBA as to whether the effort should be set-aside for the 8(a) program.  A sources sought synopsis was issued 14 September 2006 inviting interested 8(a) and SDVOSB firms to provide capability information.  Information received was evaluated by the PCO and forwarded to SBA.  As a result of this evaluation and review, the original decision to set the requirement aside for SDVOSB was confirmed.  Accordingly, the requirement is hereby resynopsised as follows.  The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Division intends to acquire Education and Training Services to support the Naval School Explosive Ordnance Disposal (NAVSCOLEOD), at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, following the procedures outlined in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  Services will include instruction of military and civilian personnel, related instructional support, curriculum maintenance, and curriculum development for course in the areas of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD).  It is intended that the resultant solicitation will be set-aside for exclusive participation by Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  The resultant solicitation shall include a one-year base period of performance, and contain provisions for four (4) additional, consecutive, twelve (12) month option periods.  It is anticipated that a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded as a result of the solicitation.  The closing date for receipt of proposals will be established in the Request For Proposals (RFP).  It is intended to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the solicitation.  The source selection will consider the offerors? technical proposal more important than the offerors? Price/Cost Proposal.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code and Small business size standard are 611699 and $6.5M, respectively.  Upon its release, the RFP will be made available electronically at www.neco.navy.mil.  All qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned 
Small Businesses (SDVOSB) are encouraged to submit proposals for consideration to the Government.  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award.  See www.ccr.gov for further information and instructions.  Further, offerors are required to go on-line to the Business Partner Network at http://orca.bpn.gov to complete their online representations and certifications application (ORCA) prior to submittal of a proposal.  For questions regarding this announcement, please contact Mr. Eric Hansen, Code 270.1D, at eric.hansen@navy.mil or 215-697-9687.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION ANNOUNCES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA), INTENDS TO INCREASE THE CEILING FOR ITS HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING AND RELATED SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM ON A NON-COMPETITVE BASIS FROM $50 MILLION TO $99 MILLION.  THIS CEILING INCREASE WILL ALLOW NOAA TO MAINTAIN CRITICAL HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING OPERATIONS NATIONWIDE.  THE CONTRACTORS CORRENTLY HOLDING AWARDS SHALL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THIS PROJECT.  ANY OTHER FIRM DESIRING CONSIDERATION MUST SUBMIT DOCUMENTATION WHICH DEMONSTRATES ITS CAPABILITY TO PERFORM THIS REQUIREMENT AS ORIGINALLY DESCRIBED BELOW.

Description: 

1. The Projects: NOAA has a requirement for hydrographic surveying services to support its nautical charting mission. It is contemplated that two or more contracts will be awarded.  Although each contract will have a nationwide scope, vendors are particularly sought with specific capability to satisfy NOAA?s hydrographic survey needs in three distinct geographic areas: (1) the navigable waters of Alaska, including remote areas, bays, and harbors, (2) the Gulf of Mexico, and (3) all other navigable waters of the U.S., including the east coast, Pacific, the Great Lakes and U.S. territories.  Each indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract will have a five year term.  Task orders will be issued against the resulting contracts based on available funding.  The cumulative value of the task orders issued against the resulting contract(s) will not exceed $99 million. 

Task orders under the resulting contracts may consist of but are not limited to: 1) acquiring shallow water multibeam sounding data; 2) acquiring side scan sonar data; 3) acquiring vertical beam echosounder data; 4) determining positions and least depths on hazards to navigation; 5) installing, operating, and removing water level (tide) stations; 6) acquiring related supporting data (e.g. water level correctors, velocity of sound in the water column, vessel motion correctors, bottom sediment samples, etc.); 7) processing the data, including tidal tabulation, computation of tidal datums, tidal zoning determination, applying water level, vessel motion, and velocity of sound correctors to determine the true depths, correlating sonar targets, and compiling reports, final smooth sheets, and digital data; and 8) performing quality control during data acquisition and processing; and 9) the delivery of the data, reports, and sheets to NOAA for archival and application to the nautical charts and associated nautical products.  

All work shall be performed to NOAA specifications and the data provided in NOAA specified formats.  See http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/hsd/specs/specs.htm for typical technical specifications and a description of the deliverables. The project instructions will tailor these specifications for each task order issued.  A quality control plan will be a contract requirement.  Firms responding are encouraged to review the technical specifications and the description of deliverables before responding to this announcement. 

The resulting contracts will permit a Government COTR or observer to be present during shipboard operations.  If the contractor conducts vessel operations overnight, the contractor will be required to provide meals and accommodations to the Government COTR or observer.  

2. Selection Criteria:  Firms must provide sufficient surveying vessel(s) and equipment and sufficient technical, supervisory, and administrative personnel to ensure expeditious execution of work assignments.  Utilization of small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small businesses will be one of the evaluation factors in the selection process.  To be considered for selection, a firm must demonstrate surveying experience in the types of surveys stated above and have on payroll at least two hydrographers and a tides/water level specialist. The two hydrographers must each have a minimum of three years experience in hydrographic surveying and demonstrated experience in surveying using shallow water multibeam sonar system, vertical beam echosounder, side scan sonar system and interpreting the data.  The tides/water level specialist must have demonstrated experience in measurement of tides and water levels, tidal datums, and tidal zoning and their application to hydrographic surveying.  

Firms must show the availability of a suitable survey vessel(s) that complies with applicable U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, OSHA, and other federal regulations; data acquisition and processing systems; vertical beam echosounder system(s); shallow water multibeam sonar system(s) capable of detecting contacts measuring 2m x 2m x 1m high; side scan sonar system(s) that can detect a 1m x 1m x 1m target and with the capability to record data digitally; GPS surveying equipment for establishing horizontal control; differential GPS equipment for vessel positioning; water level measurement gauges; and equipment for determining velocity of sound in the water column.  

Evaluation factors, in descending order of importance, are:  (1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time (personnel and equipment); (4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules; (5) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of work in diverse types of localities in the U.S.; (6) Proposed plans and goals to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities on this project to small, small-disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned  small business concerns.  Evaluation criteria #6 will not apply to small business firms because subcontracting plans are not required from those concerns pursuant to FAR 19.702(b).  

An adjectival method will be used to rate each factor:

Exceptional:  The submission exceeded evaluation standards; has no significant weaknesses; reflects a high probability of satisfying the requirements.

Acceptable:	The submission met evaluation standards; any weakness can be readily corrected; reflects a good probability of satisfying the requirements.

Marginal:  The submission failed to meet minimum evaluation standards; has significant, but correctable deficiencies; reflects a low probability of satisfying the requirements. 

Unacceptable:  The submission failed to meet the minimum standards; has a low probability of satisfying the requirements; reflects significant performance risk. 

Subsequent to the initial evaluation, those firms that are considered most highly qualified may be scheduled for interviews.   

Responding firms are required to state whether they are small, small disadvantaged business, women-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, or service disabled veteran-owned small business. Responding firms are encouraged to use small business concerns in a meaningful manner in the execution of this project.  Large business firms should demonstrate their commitment and discuss proposed plans to provide subcontracting opportunities to the small business community in the performance of this project.  

Specific abilities and disciplines required include (but are not limited to):  Project Manager, Hydrographer, Tides/Water Level Specialist, Land Surveyor, and GIS Specialist (Geographers/Cartographer/Geospatial Data Analyst).  

Firms should indicate their experience using a shallow water multibeam survey system and an outline of how the Prime contractor will manage their team to ensure that quality products are delivered to NOAA.  

For evaluation factor (3) Capacity, a list of key personnel demonstrating their availability for the project considering other commitments and major equipment available for project assignment must be provided along with other pertinent data.  

3. Submission:  Responsible sources may submit a response for consideration by NOAA.  Prime contractors shall respond to this announcement for their teams.  The prime contractor shall submit one original plus three copies of its team?s response to this synopsis.  The response shall consist of Standard Form 330 (SF330) and other material not to exceed 100 pages in total.  Copies of the SF330, instructions for completing the SF330, and continuation pages can be obtained through the General Services Administration?s forms directory at:  http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do  
Each original submission and copy shall be bound (e.g. 3-ring binder, GBC comb binding, etc.).  

Carefully read and follow the instructions printed on the SF330.  The team?s qualifications for this project should be presented in Part I of the form.  Responding firms must submit a separate Part II ? General Qualifications of the SF330 for each firm that will be part of the team proposed for this contract.  Evaluation criteria (3) Capacity, (5) Locality, and (6) Subcontracting as defined above should be addressed in Part I, Section H, Block 30 of the SF330. 

Responses (SF330s) are due to the following address no later than 1:00 pm (EST), July 27, 2007: U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA, NOS/NMFS/OAR Acquisition Management Division (OFA65), Attn: Linda Brainard, 1305 East-West Hwy., SSMC#4 Station 7607, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910-3282.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is soliciting for capability statements from all interested parties as a general contractor for a new laboratory building (B1E) in Boulder, Colorado.  The NAICS code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional building construction, and the small business size standard is $31 million.  The project is planned to be announced in the fall of 2007 with an award anticipated for the spring of 2008.  The estimated price range of this project is $50,000,000.00 to $80,000,000.00.     Completion time for this project is estimated at eight hundred (800) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.

The proposed NIST Boulder Building 1 Extension (B1E), originally identified as the Advanced Technology Laboratory (ATL), was first conceived in 1994 as the most viable means for NIST to address its pre-eminent technically demanding facilities needs.  Faced with aging laboratory facilities and a burgeoning advancement in high-technology scientific research, NIST Boulder completed designs for a new Advanced Technology Laboratory in 1995 to head off the ultimate failure of existing facilities and to meet the technological needs of NIST scientific programs.  

The B1E will be one of the most technologically advanced buildings in the world.  The laboratory combines the features of close temperature control, vibration isolation, air cleanliness, and demanding power quality into a facility of crucial national importance.   The B1E consists of an L4 High Performance Lab, L5 Instrument Lab and L6 Precision. Temperature control will be achieved down to +/- 0.1 degree C in some areas, humidity control to +/- 5%, air filtration to M3.5 (class 100), and vibration control to < 3 micrometers/second.  At the B1E, electrical substations will be installed to transform site high voltage of 13.2 kV down to 480/277 V. State-of-the-art clean power quality will be required to meet stringent lab requirements and eliminate variables from scientific research. The new facility will provide for the current needs of quantum science research in computing and communications, nanotechnology, improved atomic clock research, high speed electronic measurements, and microfabrication of research devices. 

The proposed B1E gross building area is approximately 137,000 square feet. Environmental and space requirements for the building are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST?s most technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness.  The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1E cannot be economically met with renovated laboratory space; therefore, the B1E is a necessity for NIST?s continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. 

The solicitation will be announced as a best value trade off process (FAR 15.101-1).   The government will not pay for any information solicited.  Offers that do not meet all the requirements or are not submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLB), for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses to host, plan, develop, implement and evaluate a public genomics community outreach program using a community forum as the core component of the program.   The materials developed and example set by the Community Genetics Forums held in 2005, 2006, and plans for the 2007 Forum, should be used to learn from those experiences. The overall goal of the project is to develop new models of community engagement or enhance existing models (i.e. previous Forums or other community engagement projects) of public engagement and public participation within the geographic communities targeted for the project.  It is a further goal to develop and evaluate genetics education and public participation supportive materials for the community that can be adapted by others wishing to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a public genetics forum with community engagement in their respective communities. 

The statement of work is as follows:  Title:  NHGRI Community Genetics Forum 2008: Continued Development, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Model Collaborative Community Engagement Program 

Mission - The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) led the National Institutes of Health?s (NIH) contribution to the International Human Genome Project, which had as its primary goal the sequencing of the human genome. This project was successfully completed in April 2003.  Now, the NHGRI?s mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. 

To that end the NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. The NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals. 

The Education and Community Involvement Branch (ECIB) leads the Institute?s public education efforts. ECIB also advises the NHGRI director and senior staff on a broad range of issues regarding public education and community involvement. The branch initiates, develops, implements and evaluates education and community involvement programs to engage a broad range of the public in understanding genomics and its translation to health and society. The branch also acts as the liaison between the NHGRI and communities to further its mission, and oversees programs and initiatives for minorities and special populations. 

Background of the Project - In the spring of 2005, ECIB, in conjunction with the University of Washington, held the first annual Community Genetics Forum (http://www.genome.gov/14514654). The goals of this Forum were: to engage Northwest communities in dialogue about genetics and the ethical, legal and social implications of genetics research (ELSI); to create a forum and environment for future dialogue independent of federal sponsorship; and to create a model community engagement program and supportive materials that would be adapted by others wishing to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a public genetics forum with community outreach in their respective communities.  More than 400 members of the public participated in three days of activities. 

In September of 2006, the second annual Community Genetics Forum was held in North Carolina, in collaboration with the University of North Carolina and Duke University http://genome.gov/19517845 . The goals of this Forum were to engage communities across North Carolina, including African American communities, Hispanic communities, and student and faculty audiences from North Carolina Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  

Currently, planning for the 2007 Community Genetics Forum is underway, to be hosted by the University of Michigan (UM).  UM has successfully engaged National Community Committee (NCC) organizations across five states in the Midwest (Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois).  Five forums are set to be held on October 12, 2007 in each of the locations, and they will be connected by videoconferencing.

The outcomes and lessons learned from the three Community Genetics Forums contribute to the establishment of a model community engagement program.  ECIB plans to use this developing model to support future annual Community Genetics Forums.  For more information please visit http://genome.gov/19518473. Potential contractors are encouraged to speak to previous Forum planners or ECIB staff to learn more about the specific projects. 

Geographic Region: - In an effort to reach different geographic areas of the country, the NHGRI has selected DHHS regions VIII and IX as appropriate locations for the 2008 Forum.  An objective of the Forum is to extend beyond the immediate geographic reach of the NIH.  The 2008 Forum should seek to engage communities from one or more locations from this region.  This region is defined to include:   Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau. 

Please refer to www.hhs.gov/about/regions for more specific information about other regions. 

Objectives for Project - The NHGRI is seeking an organization to host, plan, develop, implement and evaluate a public genomics community outreach program using a community forum as the core component of the program. The materials developed and example set by the Community Genetics Forums held in 2005 2006, and plans for the 2007 Forum, should be used to learn from those experiences. The overall goal of the project is to develop new models of community engagement or enhance existing models (i.e. previous Forums or other community engagement projects) of public engagement and public participation within the geographic communities targeted for the project.  It is a further goal to develop and evaluate genetics education and public participation supportive materials for the community that can be adapted by others wishing to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a public genetics forum with community engagement in their respective communities. 

The Community Genetics Forum project is to be a collaborative effort between the NHGRI and the contractor. It is expected that the NHGRI?s Education and Community Involvement Branch will participate actively in the planning and development of the program, and that members of the NHGRI will participate in the Forum itself, as appropriate (travel costs of NHGRI individuals will be supported by the Institute, separately from this purchase order). 

The objectives of the Community Genetics Forum include: 
?	To identify existing community groups, organizations, representatives, etc, with which to engage and consult throughout planning of the Forum; 
?	To facilitate the establishment of ongoing community relationships that continue beyond the Forum itself; 
?	To create a Forum that reflects the interests, concerns, and questions of the target community; 
?	To build upon existing relationships between the community and the contractor; 
?	To establish methods and opportunities by which community members can participate and contribute to planning of the Forum; 
?	To engage community groups to facilitate a dialogue to identify questions, concerns, and education needs related to genomics; 
?	To engage communities to provide input into initiatives of the NHGRI and the NIH in genomic research; 
?	To facilitate sustainable relationships between the community, the contractor, and the NHGRI; 
?	To involve a target audience inclusive of minorities and special populations; 
?	To increase awareness, interest, and understanding of the field of genetics, genomics, and the ethical, legal, and social implications of genetics research; 
?	To increase awareness of current research and scientific advances in genetics; 
?	To increase awareness of current health education advances in genetics; 
?	To increase students? awareness of career options in genomics, genetics, and ELSI research; 
?	To increase awareness and understanding of the implications of genomic science for health care and society; and 
?	To have ongoing collaboration with the NHGRI in the Forum program development and implementation. 

Scope of Project - The selected organization will host, plan, develop, implement, and evaluate a genetics public forum with community outreach. In doing such, the contractor will develop community engagement reference materials for public dissemination, known here as the ?final project product.? This final product may be reproduced and distributed to assist other individuals in the planning, development, implementation, and evaluation of other genetics public symposia with community outreach in their respective communities. The contractor will work with ECIB to develop the structure of these resources. Generally, this product will add insight to previous lessons learned about how to engage communities around genetics. 

In the project proposal, the contractor should be able to demonstrate previous collaborations or partnerships with community groups and members of the public who will participate in the planning of the Community Genetics Forum. The proposal should also describe existing relationships with community based organizations, and a willingness of these organizations to participate in Forum planning.  The goal of this Forum is not simply to present topics or information believed to be of importance to the community but, rather to actively involve community members from the outset, so that they may help to inform topics, formats, and agendas. 

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the selected organization (referred to as ?Contractor?) will furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform the specific tasks delineated below. 

Tasks Required of Project

Task 1: Planning - The Contractor will prepare a document that will be based on the Contractor?s proposal and this Statement of Work (SOW) and will include activity timelines, detailed methods of community engagement, and how identified partners will be involved. In addition, the planning document should include a description of an evaluation plan for the community outreach activities and the forum including the goals and objectives to be measured, how they will be measured, and data collection, compilation, analyses, and reporting activities to be conducted.

The final planning document will be due to the NHGRI six weeks after the contract is awarded. 

Task 2: Development and Implementation  - The development of Forum activities and format should be carried out in consultation with community groups.  Because a main objective of this Forum is to create a program that reflects the interests, questions, and concerns of the community, the planning of this Forum should involve comprehensive community consultation.  For example, this may be in the form of focus groups, a community working group or advisory committee, or ongoing meetings with members of the public or representatives of community based organizations.  These activities should also be used to encourage members of the public to attend the Forum event. 

The Contractor will provide and/or conduct a range of services and activities leading to the implementation of the public forum with community outreach. These services and activities include: 
?	Carrying out the community outreach activities to assist in identifying and defining community needs, forum themes and appropriate formats, and advertising strategies;
?	Securing meeting space for the forum; 
?	Securing lodging space for forum speakers and participants, as needed; 
?	Making travel arrangements for forum speakers and participants, as needed; 
?	Determining and arranging for any special needs of speakers and participants; 
?	Determining and arranging for AV needs of forum speakers and facilitating on-site AV support; 
?	Handling pre-forum registration; 
?	Preparing forum aids, such as name badges and directional signs; 
?	Preparing fact sheets and other appropriate public education materials to support the Forum; 
?	Compiling and reproducing materials for the forum packets; 
?	Providing on-site support on the day(s) of the forum to include participant registration and distribution of materials; 
?	Providing a final registration report and a final attendance report to the NHGRI no later than one month after the forum.  This report should include demographic information on attendees; 
?	Reimbursing forum speakers for all expenses incurred during travel to the forum according to Federal government regulations; 
?	Providing forum speakers with an honorarium, as appropriate; 
?	Establishing and handling a scholarship fund and/or reimbursement fund for the community outreach activities and forum participants; 
?	Providing reimbursements to forum speakers and participants within two weeks of receiving the voucher; 
?	Providing the NHGRI with a final highlights or summary document of the community outreach activities and the forum no later than three months after the forum; and 
?	Securing and providing the appropriate personnel and resources needed to document the planning and conduct of the public forum with community outreach to be able to create the final product of the project. 


During the course of this task, a representative from the selected organization will communicate twice monthly with a representative from the NHGRI. This communication can take the form of a phone call or e-mail and will provide the NHGRI with regular updates on the progress of the activities identified above, as well as others that will be conducted as part of the development and implementation process of this project. The twice monthly communication will also serve as an opportunity for problem solving and strategizing throughout the collaboration, including the development and implementation phase. The organization?s representative and an NHGRI representative will establish a schedule for the twice monthly communication. 

Task 3: Evaluation  - The Contractor will secure the qualified personnel needed to conduct the evaluation activities as described in the planning document (see Task 1). The Contractor will obtain the appropriate approvals, if any, needed to conduct an evaluation including individuals participating in the community outreach activities and individuals attending the public forum. The Contractor will carry out evaluation activities to measure each objective of the community outreach and the public forum, including the development, testing and implementation of appropriate measurement tools, collection of data, compilation of data, analyses of data, and generation of an evaluation report. 

The Contractor will provide the NHGRI with a final evaluation report no later than three months following the last data collection activity. 

Task 4: Creation of the Project Product - The Contractor will secure the qualified personnel and resources needed to create the final project product, which will document the public forum and community outreach. This product could take the form of a book, DVD, or CD-ROM, be web-based or have another format as discussed and agreed upon with ECIB. The purpose of the project product is to provide the government and others with a model for planning, developing, implementing, and evaluating any future genetics public forums with community outreach in their respective communities.  Additionally, the purpose of this product is to enhance the lessons learned from previous Forums about engaging communities around genetics. This product should improve on models created from previous Community Genetics Forums. Users of the project product should be able to easily follow the information provided and adapt the relevant information to their project at a level of effort appropriate to their project?s scope. Examples of the concept of the project product include A Planner?s Guide: Making Health Communication Programs Work from the National Cancer Institute and Designing and Implementing an Effective Tobacco Counter-Marketing Campaign from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

The Contractor will provide the NHGRI with the final project product no later than three months following the completion of the project?s evaluation activities.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice revises the notice published 30 April 2007 (W911SR-07- R-0020).   This Sources Sought Synopsis is for planning purposes ONLY.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not receive a response.  The Joint Program Manager for Nuclear Biological and Chemical Contamination Avoidance (JPM NBC CA) has a requirement for a Join t Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Reconnaissance container, which includes a set of mission specific kits that provide full spectrum CBRN detection, protection and sampling capability.  The capabilities sought include: 	- Handheld Detection and Identification Equipment 	- Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) 	- Self Decontamination Equipment 	- Marking, Sampling and Reporting Equipment. The JPM NBC CA is seeking a Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) to design the interfaces and package, integrate, test, train, field, and sustain the CBRN set of mission specific kits into a modular, transportable container designed to be carried on various platf orms. Initally, the LSI will perform an analysis of the GOTS and COTS equipment from a variety of sources which may include, government test data, performance specifications, the capabilities document and contractor and independent test data.  The LSI will  then recommend a baseline set of equipment leveraging test data. The equipment will be integrated to form the set of mission specific kits.  This dismountable equipment package will allow light forces to tailor it to provide the capability required to Arm y Light Brigade Combat Teams and support CBRN Site Assessment (SA) missions.  In the assessment role, the equipment will be used to detect, identify, collect, and sample potential CBRN materials obtained from buildings, bunkers, caves, ships, containers, a nd other areas that are either inaccessible or impractical to employ a mounted reconnaissance vehicle (NBCRV) or armored reconnaissance system (NBCRS).  JNBCRS 2 will consist of two major components: a modular container with internal storage and the CBRN m ission package.  The set of mission specific kits will consist of Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) current available technology.  Potential Key Performance Parameters required are: 1) Detection and Identification of CBRN,TIC,TIM hazards in a tactical operational environment.  The probability of detection and identification must have a likelihood of 80%.  2) Deployable and operational  in Desert and Tropical regions; and 3) Individual Protection Equipment with a level of protection that meets operational mission periods for more than 40 minutes. Potential reliability factors include: At least 90% probability of completing a 72-hour operating period without experiencing an Operational Mission Failure.  Potential maintainability factors include:  90% of all field level maintenance actions to restore  loss of mission essential functions must be completed by the operator within 15 minutes.  Operator level corrective maintenance of this category of equipment is envisioned to be limited to actions such as cycling power, restarting, re-establishing loose c onnections, or making minor adjustments.  The Acquisition Strategy for the Joint Nuclear biological and Chemical Reconnaissance System (JNBCRS) Increment II has three phases. 	Phase I  Procure and field by FY08 a set of mission specific kits as part of an Urgent Need. 	Phase II  Procure, integrate, test, and field by FY09 a set of mission specific kits as defined in the JNBCR Inc II Capabilities Production Document (CPD). 	Phase III  Procure, integrate, test and field by FY11 a set of full spectrum sets of mission specific kits that are modular, interchangeable and include data transmission (reach back) capability. Companies which have the capability to serve as a Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) for the container and the equipment required should respond to this announcement.  Interested companies should provide co mpany name, address, telephone, email contact, and a capabilities statement containing a summary describing their technical capabilities, manufacturing capacity, and information on their past performance on Government contracts.  Please limit your document s to one to two pages.  Responses to this survey must be submitted electronically within 15 calendar days from the date of this notice to john.jump@us.army.mil and michael.bucci@us.army.mil.   All information collected shall be used by the Government for p lanning purposes only.

<SUBJECT>B -- OSCAR OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND TESTING
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Environmental Satellite Data Information Service (NESDIS) has a requirement as a follow-on contract to install, and verify proper operation of latest version of the OSCAR software system on a workstation at the NESDIS Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry (LSA) in Silver Spring, MD. 

NOAA intends to negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with Earth and Space Research (ESR) of  175 Parfitt Way  SW  N210 Baunbridge Island, WA 98110 pursuant to Statutory Authority: 41 USC 253 (C) (1) ? only one responsible source for a 12-month period of performance with no additional option periods.  OSCAR is the only real time ocean surface current analysis product available. It was developed by ESR and supported by the National Ocean Partnership Program agencies, NOAA and NASA. 

ESR is the developer of OSCAR pilot project global processing system development and improvement which is located at the ESR facility in Seattle.  The OSCAR website (www.oscar.noaa.gov) is maintained and maintained at NOAA/PMEL, Seattle.  

ESR will investigate and report on the possibility of including the ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer on the European MetOP) wind fields for OSCAR, continue ongoing calibration and validation analysis relative to the surface velocity program (SVP) drifters, explore methods to compute de-biased merged drifter and satellite derived current fields, and continue to maintain the present computation and test-bed system at ESR and will continue to provide direction for the maintenance and development of the web server at PMEL to provide upgrades as well as continuing to serve global fields for climate monitoring and research applications.  ESR will continue to provide monthly tropical ocean surface velocity and anomaly maps to the NOAA Climate Diagnostics Bulletin, analyze ENSO conditions, provide data for NCEP?s use in ENSO prediction and otherwise lend support to NOAA?s ENSO and climate monitoring.   

This procurement is to establish the OSCAR capability at NOAA?s National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Ocean Prediction Center (OPC).

ESR is unique capability for the OSCAR follow-on are based on the present NOAA system and its end product being started and developed at Earth System Research (ESR) in 2001. ESR participated in the OSCAR-II project  and expanded the capability to monitor ocean surface currents on the entire global oceans within 60 degrees of the equator. The OSCAR products were made available in near Real-Time on the Web to the ocean research community at www.oscar.noaa.gov.

The experience gained in the OSCAR Pilot project and the OSCAR-II project has made ESR a leader in the estimation of ocean surface current for the global oceans. This product can now be transferred to an operational environment to support NOAA?s critical missions for early warnings and protection of life and property. 

The transition to an operational product will require a new level of product accuracy, consistency, and continuity. ESR will have to improve the calibration and validation capabilities to allow the incorporation of the OSCAR product in the operational NOAA ocean models. Also, the continuity of operations has to allow for methods to respond to contingencies such as interruptions of input satellite data or down-time of computer operations.

In 2007-2008, ESR will expand the OSCAR system to improve the operational applications of the global ocean currents in model analyses, in NOAA research ship operations, and the transfer of OSCAR for NOAA?s near real-time operational applications. The end product will be a stand-alone system at NESDIS capable of producing the ocean surface currents. Once it is verified and checkout, the system will be transferred by NESDIS to NOAA?s National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Ocean Prediction Center (OPC) for operational implementation. 

The experience gained by ESR during the original NOPP OSCAR research project will be invaluable in providing an operational system to NOAA?s NCEP Ocean Prediction Center. Disruption of the existing working relationship between NOAA and ESR would significantly delay the implementation of OSCAR to the operational NOAA Ocean Prediction Center. ESR is the only responsible and capable source to ensure that the data is provided to NOAA on schedule

It is believed that only this entity can satisfy the agency requirement to provide scientific and technical expertise.  Interested persons must demonstrate their capability in order to be considered for this opportunity. This is not a request for Competitive proposals.  Accordingly, no competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not to open up for competitive procedures.  All responsible sources that can meet the requirements and provide the items as listed above may respond to this solicitation by submitting its capabilities to the attention of the Contracting Officer for evaluation.

<SUBJECT>A--Cooperative Partnership and Opportunity
<DESC>The United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Energy Resources Program is involved in studying the availability and quality of the Nation's mineral and energy resources, as well as the economic and environmental effects of resource extraction and use. The renewed interest in the potential of oil shale to support the nation's future energy demands has generated a need for better information about oil shale retorting methods as companies consider the economics of this potential enterprise.  The USGS is interested in initiating a study effort that will contrast and compare various oil shale in-situ retort technologies to determine the factors controlling their yields and quality of petroleum generated, as well as generated components of environmental concern.  Tentatively, the types of retort conditions to be considered in the study will be anhydrous, superheated steam and supercritical CO2. USGS is proposing to begin a laboratory study of yields and quality of petroleum generated by in situ retorting with the Green River Fm. in Rio Blanco Co, Colorado.  USGS is seeking partners who are interested in participating in the laboratory and later field trials who have samples, personnel or funding to contribute to the effort.  The USGS plans to develop the partnerships under the authority of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act as amended.  USGS will consider other retorting technologies for the planned study depending on the interest of a particular party or parties.

<SUBJECT>D -- SAS Statistical Software Maintenance Renewal
<DESC>Request for Information:  Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Executive Information Systems LLC for SAS Statistical Software Maintenance Renewals. The Government intends to award for a base period of one year and four option years.

Mission:  TTB?s mission is to collect alcohol and tobacco excise taxes; to ensure that these products are labeled, advertised, and marketed in accordance with the law; to administer the laws and regulations in a manner that protects the consumer and revenue, and promotes voluntary compliance.

TTB Background:  On January 24, 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (the Act) established the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau within the Department of the Treasury.  The main responsibilities of TTB are protecting the public and collecting revenue.  These responsibilities are carried out by developing regulations, conducting product analyses, and ensuring tax and trade compliance with the Federal Alcohol Administration Act and the Internal Revenue Code. 

Nature and Description of Action:  The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau?s Risk Management Office requires annual software maintenance support and updates renewals for the existing SAS software licenses.  SAS Statistical Software was purchased in July 2004 from Executive Information Systems, in accordance with the partnership agreement with SAS Corporation.  TTB has rights to use the software via license agreement.

A sole source to Executive Information Systems is intended for this order, based on licenses requirement.  No other known source has access to this license.

No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than seven days after publication of this notice.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Executive Information Systems, LLC.

Other Information:  Electronic submissions, in response to this Notice, shall be sent to the attention of Mindy Wargowsky and e-mailed to psb3@bpd.treas.gov.  Electronic submissions must be received no later than 2:00 PM ET, Friday, July 20, 2007.  Please note that an RFQ document is not available at this time.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

SCOPE OF WORK:   Background:   Rapid advances in understanding the patterns of human genetic variation and maturing methods for genotyping are providing powerful research tools for identifying genetic variants that contributed to health and disease.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recognizes that the full value of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) can only be realized if the genotype and phenotype datasets derived from these studies are made available as rapidly as possible to a wide range of scientific investigators.  GWAS data release practices must also be consistent with the informed consent provided by individual participants and just protect the privacy and confidentiality of the research participants.  The NIH is seeking to develop a specific data-sharing policy for GWAS, across its Institutes and Centers, to harmonize the practices through which data will be made available widely and freely available for research. The proposed GWAS policy calls for investigators funded by the NIH to submit de-identified genetic data to a centralized NIH GWAS repository.  

During the initial phase of policy development, a trans-NIH working group established a GWAS policy website, provided background information on the policy initiative for internal and external audiences, and solicited and analyzed input on from investigators, patients, and other interested parties via a Request for Information (August 2006) and an NIH Town Hall Meeting (December 2006).  The proposed policy and public commentary involves complex and sensitive issues related to participant privacy concerns, FOIA requirements, potential risks and benefits for participants, informed consent or re-consent of patients to permit access to their genetic data, publication rights of investigator, intellectual property rights of scientists, and data access and data management procedures.  

The next phase of the policy development involves the refinement, finalization, launch, and implementation of the policy.  These next steps will be based on the input from the Request for Information and NIH Town Hall Meeting; the development of an implementation plan; and preparation of presentation and other background materials for external and internal audiences.

The trans-NIH working group is chaired by the Director, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, (NHLBI). The GWAS Project Management Team is led by the Deputy Director, NHLBI, who works in collaboration with senior officials in the NIH Office of Science Policy and the Office of the Director, National Human Genome Research Institute.  Input is solicited from all affected Institutes and Centers at the NIH via working groups throughout the policy development process.

Statement of Work: Specifically the Contractor Shall:
Provide support to finalize the NIH GWAS data sharing policy.  Specific tasks include:

1.	Development of implementation plan to include various outreach activities for NIH staff, and the extramural community. This may include a notice in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts or an article in OER Nexus or OER Insider. This includes updates to the GWAS web site.

2.	Management of the GWAS e-mail box and drafting of FAQs or standard responses to controlled correspondence. 

3.	Coordination of ongoing policy meetings and activities.

4.	Development of documentation regarding governance structure for Data Access Committees (DAC). 

5.	Coordinating the details in implantation of the policy through a weekly meeting with the GWAS Policy Implementation Workgroup (GPIW). This may include drafting updated language for inclusion in FOAs, updates to policy statements, instructions and forms.

6.	Continuing support of the GWAS Project Management Team and GPIW through December 2007, which involves:  meeting scheduling, agenda development, meeting material production, meeting follow-up such as analysis of meeting outcomes, policy finalization timeline creation, tracking of policy related items and meetings, and continuing communication with relevant policy members. 

7.	Continuing support for communications and rollout steps and logistics which includes:  rafting PowerPoint presentation, updating the communication plan, updating web site content, and after policy release, providing support to the governance committees by setting up initial meetings and providing background information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is R1PB47000703 "O'Neill Federal Building Barriers Project" and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-16.  The associated NAICS code is 327390 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

Description of requirement: 

I.  SUPPLIES/SERVICES AND COST.  The Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill Federal Building, located at 10 Causeway Street, Boston, Massachusetts, is a capital asset of the General Service Administration, Public Building Service (PBS). At both the national and local levels, PBS is responsible for, among other things, providing building operations and maintenance.  The Boston Service Center of PBS, Region 1, has identified a need to maintain barrier security around the perimeter of the O'Neill Federal Building with aesthetics that match the surrounding area and enhance the appearance and public appreciation of the O'Neill Federal Building.  PBS installed temporary "Jersey Barriers"  around the southern and western sides of the O'Neill Federal Building. The barriers provide protection from vehicles parking on or too near the building and Federal property.  The barriers therefore provide protection against possible terrorist and other disruptive activity. The eastern side of the building is protected from vehicular traffic by North Station and the TD Bank North Garden as well as several large cement planters that are maintained by the TD Bank North Garden.  The northern side of the building, which includes a loading dock and access to the O'Neill Federal Building garage, is protected by a manned security both, several jersey barriers and a rolling fence.  The current jersey barriers are plastic and use water for the weight providing protection against vehicles attempting access to the O'Neill Federal Building.  PBS identified replacement of the plastic jersey barriers as necessary to maintain the security of the O'Neill Building and to ensure GSA meets its mission of providing public buildings that are symbols of America's democracy and which contribute to the vitality of its neighboring community.  II.	PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS . The barriers will be placed on property owned by the city of Boston.  Boston is continuing to redevelop the area directly around the O'Neill Building as part of the larger "Big Dig" project.  Because Boston may change the area immediately surrounding the O'Neill Building, the barriers must be capable of being removed and used at another location:  the barriers are not a permanent solution.  Although the barriers are not a permanent solutions, the purpose of the barriers is to provide reasonable protection against vehicular intrusion. In order to comply with certain safety concerns, the barriers must not include any trash receptacles and the number of planters should be kept to a minimum. If benches are proposed, they must be of solid block construction or other construction which represents a significant deterrent to vehicle access.  Overall, the barriers must discourage unintended uses such as skateboarding and long term loitering. The Contractor shall coordinate delivery and installation of the barriers concurrently with removal of the existing barriers and redelivery of the existing barriers to a Government specified location (To be Determined). The Contractor shall ensure no lapse or gap in barrier protection.  The Contractor shall meet or exceed the dates for delivery and installation of the barriers and removal of the existing barriers.  III.	OTHER REQUIREMENTS.  In order to ensure a complete understanding of this requirement by Offerors and to provide maximum value for the Government from the resulting contract, Offerors are required to attend the site visit. Government attendees at the site visits will include, at a minimum, the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer's Representative, and a representative of the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Protective Service.  The organized site visit is scheduled for 10:00 a.m., July 30, 2007.  Participants will meet in the lobby of the O'Neill Federal Building, 10 Causeway Street, Boston, MA 02222.  Prospective attendees must provide his or her name, company name, telephone, and email address to the Contracting Officer not later than 24 hours prior to the site visit(s).  Please note that attendees are required to complete a security check and therefore should allot themselves additional time to clear security prior to the site visit. Questions of a general nature may be asked and answered at the site visits.  Specific questions must be submitted in writing within three (3) calendar days following the site visit.  The information shall be sent via email to anthony.pellegrino@gsa.gov. 
			
The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors Commercial Items (Sep 2006)* applies to this acquisition and is incorporated by reference. (* (c) Period for acceptance of offers.  The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.)  

The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies to this 
solicitation.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

When combined, the non-price evaluation factors (Technical Approach/Design and Past Performance) are approximately equal to price.  Between the non-price factors, Technical Approach/Design is slightly more important than Past Performance. 

1. Technical Approach/Design a. Technical Approach, Sub-factor 1, Perimeter Protection: Does the Technical Approach meet the requirements of the RFQ?  This is a GO/NO GO evaluation factor. b.  Technical Approach, Subfactor 2, Delivery Terms:  Does the proposal include the dates for delivery and installation of the barriers on or before September 28, 2007?  This is a GO/NO GO evaluation factor.  c.  Technical Approach, Subfactor 3, Delivery Terms:  Does the proposal include the approach for ensuring no gaps in barrier protection during delivery and installation? Note:  This is a GO/NO GO evaluation factor.  d. Technical Approach, Subfactor 4, Delivery Terms:  Does the proposal detail the method by which the installation will occur with minimal disruption to vehicular and pedestrian traffic?  Note:  This is a GO/NO GO evaluation factor. e.  Technical Approach, Subfactor 5,  Barriers Relocation:  Does the proposal include a provision for delivering the old, removed barriers to the located specified in the RFQ?  This is a GO/NO GO factor.  f. Technical Approach, Subfactor 6, Design:   The Government will evaluate the design proposed.  All proposed designs shall include only those products available on the Federal Supply Schedules.  No open market items shall be proposed.  Evaluations of design are subjective by nature; however, the Government will inject a level of objectivity into this subfactor by having five (5) GSA Senior Management Officials rank each design on the degree to which the design integrates with the O?Neill Building and its environs. Higher ranked designs will be rated higher for this subfactor. Recall, the Technical Approach/Design and Past Performance criteria are approximately equal to price.  Therefore, the contract may be awarded to a slightly higher ranked Design even if the cost of that Technical Approach/Design is slightly more expensive than a lower ranked design.  2. Past Performance. The Offeror will be evaluated on performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used as an evaluation factor as required by FAR 15.304(c)(3). The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  An offeror with no past performance information will receive a neutral rating, i.e., the rating will not add to or detract from its Past Performance rating.   In order for the Government to evaluate Past Performance, the Offeror shall submit the following information as part of its proposal for both the Offeror and all proposed subcontractors:  (a) A list of all contracts and subcontracts completed during the past 3 years and all contracts and  subcontracts currently in process for projects similar in size and complexity to this requirement.  The contracts listed may include those entered into by other departments and agencies of the Federal Government; contracts with state and local governments; and contracts with commercial customers. The Offeror shall include for each contract and subcontract: (1) Name of contracting activity; (2) Contract number; (3) Contract type; (4) Total contract value; (5) Contracting officer and telephone number; (6) Program manager, telephone number, and facsimile number; (7) Description of project; (8) Administrative contracting officer, if different from (5) above, and telephone number; and (9) List of major subcontractors/teaming partners.  (b) The Offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and subcontracts identified in paragraph (a) above, and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems. The Offeror should not provide general information on its performance on the identified contracts because general performance information will be obtained from the references. (c) The Offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the Offeror has a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Award, other Government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications. Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over 3 years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply. 3.  Price.  The Contractor shall propose a firm-fixed price for the requirement. 

Only one award will be made in response to this solicitation.  Multiple awards will not be made.

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Nov 2006), with its offer and/or verify by the ORCA website.  

The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Feb 2007), applies to this acquisition.  

The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (MAR 2007), applies to this acquisition. The following additional clauses are incorporated by reference to implement provisions of law or executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items or components:  52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (Jun 2003). 

A site plan is available upon request.   An organized site visit is scheduled for 1:00 p.m., July 30, 2007.   Prospective attendees must provide his or her name, company name, telephone, and email address to the Contracting Officer not later than 24 hours prior to the site visit(s).

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-17.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all interested offerors may submit a quote.

This requirement is for the purchase of a High Energy Detector, Varian Model PAXSCAN 2520, modified to meet the technical needs of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), Neutron Imaging Facility.  

The Neutron Imaging Facility within the NIST/NCNR is a national resource which provides users from Industry, National Laboratories, and Academia the most advanced neutron radiography capabilities in the world.  In addition, the facility 
provides testing capabilities to users to test hydrogen fuel cells in situ with the neutron radiography capability.

The facility operates 24 hours a day 7 days a week during reactor cycles.  The Neutron Imaging Facility is used by NIST, as well as major automotive companies and other industries, for considerable amounts of proprietary and non-proprietary research.  Its major research partner, General Motors, relies on this system to function at a 100% level. 

A high energy detector functions within the Neutron Imaging Facility to capture neutron images to dynamically image water formed inside of a fuel cell at a rate of 30 images per second.  It is the heart of the Neutron Imaging Facility for fuel cell research.  


The existing PAXSCAN 2520 was purchased in 2004.  The PAXSCAN 2520 being purchased is an identical replacement of the existing system.  In the event of a failure of the existing system NIST would immediately utilize this system in its place while the damaged system is repaired or replaced.  Without this equipment the facility does not operate.  

NIST currently owns one backup system, however, this older system is no longer suitable as a backup due to its age.  NIST requires another one-to-one replacement that will perform at the same level as the existing system.  The PAXSCAN 2520 is the basis of the new high energy detector.

All interested quoters shall provide a quote for the following line items.  All equipment must be new.  Upon receipt NIST will immediately perform installation and testing of the equipment.  

LINE ITEM 0001:  Quantity one each PAXSCAN 2520, manufactured by Varian.  The PAXSCAN must be modified to meet all of the following technical requirements:

(2) The detector case must match the original high energy design with a ? inch-20 hole pattern the same as the original Varian Paxscan 2520 high energy detector.  The readout electronics must be properly shielded with lead, particularly the gate drivers.  Neutron shielding will be added later by NIST.  This configuration ensures that the readout electronics are external to receptor area to avoid direct exposure to incident beam; 

(3) Conversion screen changeable.  The Contractor shall mount a neutron-to-light converter screen on top of the amorphous silicon receptor in a light tight manner.  The converter screen shall be provided by NIST and will be optimally sized by NIST for the Paxscan 2520 receptor and may range in thickness from 0.5 mm to 1 mm thick;
  
(4) The converter screen must be held in place with thin aluminum or magnesium alloy windows.  A thin piece of foam may be used to apply pressure to mate the scintillator to the receptor; 

(5) There must be no plastic materials or poly-carbonate materials at any point upstream from the receptor, except for a very thin (less than 5 mm thick) section of foam as in Specification 3;.

(6) Detector package must be rated for high energy at 450 kV; 

(7) Must be compatible with and equivalent to fiber optic models of the Varian Paxscan 2520 DCDS 4.1 Receptor;

WARRANTY:  The Contractor shall provide the original manufactures (Varian) warranty for the equipment.  Warranty shall include all parts and labor. Warranty shall be on-site or return to vendor as deemed necessary by the Contractor.   If on-site, all travel costs shall be included in the warranty.

<DESC>Combined Synopsis/Solicitation HSCG38-07-Q-500030 is amended to include the following justification/documentation as required by FAR 11.05 for the purchase of items peculiar to one manufacturer.  The closing  date and time for receipt of quotes is not extended.

Sole Source Justification
Project Title:  PURCHASE OF THE SEA PAK FORWARD OSMOSIS FILTRATION SYSTEM TO REPLACE THE OUTDATED EMERGENCY MARINED REVERSE OSMOSIS DEVICE.

Acquisition Method:  Commercial Purchase Sole Source

Company Name:  Hydration Technologies, Inc. (HTI), 2484 Ferry Street Sw, Albany, OR 97322-7801
Project Objective:  To replace the outdated Emergency Maring Reverse Osmosis Devise (EMROD) system and survival rations currently installed in Coast Guard life rafts with an improved hydration system including nutrient rich liquid.  Aviation Life Support Equipment's (ALSE) intentions with this project are two fold.  The first is to find a system for water purfication that does not require rigorous physical activity to produce water as our current system does.  ALSE desires this due to the high probability of aircrew injury resulting from ditching and egress.  An injured crewman will not be able to operate the EMROD and therefore will be able to produce water.  Second, the system can be used in a wide variety of environments and works in fresh or salt water.  There is an added benefit to the SEA PAK system which provides nutrients in the water negating the need to provide rations in life rafts creating a smaller packed raft.

Requirement Description:  Raft configurations within the Coast Guard require survival rations and water to sustain life for a minimal 24 hour optimal rescue time in accordance with COMDTINST 3710.1 (series) Chapter 7.

Reason for Sole Source:  After extensive market researchin the area of water filtration and production in a survival situation, ALSE discovered a system already in use by the US Army for extreme environment/long range patrols in scarce water environments.  HTI perfected a forward osmosis system which uses a nutrient syrup charge to draw water molecules out of a contaminated source, across a membrane, and into a catch bag requiring no pumping or physical activity.  It is done by chemical reaction vice pumping.  There are other water chemical purification products on the market, however, most are pills that are added to a canteen and only kill bacteria.  The SEA PAK, in addition to filtering bacteria, also filters out hazardous chemicals and compounds.  HTI owns the sole patent on this technology.  No other device or product can do what the SEA PAK can combining purification of water with the addition of nutrients needed to survive in harsh environments; salt and fresh water.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and offers being requested.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.  This is small business set-aside procurement.    The NAICS is 721110.  The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with the provisions of FAR 13.5.  This requirement is to provide TEMPORARY BERTHING FOR THE CREW OF THE CGC LONG ISLAND IN KETCHIKAN, AK, DURING THE PERIOD OF 1 AUG THROUGH 5 OCT 2007. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-APO1), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award of a contract will be based on the following criteria:  Past Performance and price.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract/s without discussions.  Therefore, offeror?s initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5. ********

<DESC>Amendment #2 is hereby issued to answer the below question(s). Question 1:  Is this an 8, 12, 16 or 20 cylinder 645E4 engine?  This engine has 16 cylinders. Question 2:  What brand of lube oil is currently being used in the EMD engine, please?  Lube oil currently being used is Chevron Delo 40W Railroad Duty. Question 3:  We believe that the amount of piping should be quantified - to replace the entire front end piping on an EMD generator is a huge job and we are speculating that the piping itself is not leaking, but that the joints are.  If that is the case, can you specify how many joints require renewal?  There are two connections on the oil pipe that need new gaskets.

<DESC>The Government has considered questions posed by industry and other reviews conducted within the Government and determined that an amendment to the RFP is necessary.  Although the Government has not completed its revisions, we felt it important to share information incrementally to support an efficient exection of the solicitation process.  With that, the Government is providing a 'draft amendment' with a 'draft revised RFP.'  This draft amendment does not include necessary amendments to the Exhibits or responses to the questions.  Once the Government's review is complete, the 'final' revised RFP, all Exhibits and responses to the questions posed will be provided.  

However this draft amendment does address some of the questions submitted during the pre-proposal conference.  Please review Section F and Section H specifically.  

The Government anticipates a short extension to the date for receipt of proposals.  The revised proposal due date will be published with the 'formal' amendment.

The draft amendment can be downloaded later tonight from the following:
