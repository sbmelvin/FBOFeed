<DESC>Contractor, as an independent organization and not as an agency of the Federal Government, shall furnish personnel, material, facilities and equipment necessary to assess neurocognitive, neuroendocrine, proteomic and genomic biomakers and disease pathways that underlie chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).  Because patients come from Georgia, the study must be conducted in Georgia.  Emory University Hospital is the only hospital in Georgia that has a dedicated general clinical research Center (GCRC) with staff experienced in, and facilities appropriate to, evaluation of the neuroendocrinology, cognitive function, stress responses and fMRI of persons with CFS.  A new contractor would have to establish dedicated GCRC facilities with appropriate state of the art research fMRI in Atlanta and hire and train new support staff to evaluate study subjects.  Emory University Principal Investigators have developed the clinical assessment of subjects with chronic fatigue syndrome and other fatiguing illnesses in Georgia protocol in collaboration with CDC CFS Research Program staff.  Consequently, it is believed that Emory University School of Medicine, Dept. of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, is the sole source having the capabilities which will meet the requirements of this solicitation for the reasons described above.  It is the intent of CDC to award a contract with Emory University School of Medicine if this is found to be true.  The NAICS code is 622110.

<DESC>Contractor will provide a mechanism for providing technical support services related to infectious diseases.  Contractor will provide expert advice and guidance on matters related to sciences and technology.  The various evaluations and analyses undertaken by the contractor will require information gathering, analysis, and dissemination of results that can then be used by CDC.  Contractor will provide technical support services related to assessment and analysis of issues regarding infectious diseases.  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is the only known organization that traditionally has convened the nation’s foremost scientists to deliberate and report on issues relevant to science and public policy.  The nature and purpose of the NAS make it uniquely able to conduct the work and scope of this contract.  In view of the intense public and political interest focused on these complex studies and technical services, it is imperative that a highly respected and unbiased organization, with its interest being totally related to the public health, be awarded this contract.  Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-5 states that full and open competition need not be provided for when a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made through agency or from a specified source.  Listed as an example of this is the National Academy of Sciences.  In FAR 6.302-5 (a)(2)(b)(B) full and open competition need not be provided for any contract requiring the National Academy of Sciences to investigate examine, or experiment upon any subject of science or act of significance to an executive agency and to report on those matters to the Congress or any agency of the Federal Government.  Consequently, for the above mentioned reasons, it is believed that NAS is the sole source having the capabilities which will meet the above mentioned requirements of CDC.  It is the intent of CDC to award a contract with NAS if this is found to be true.  The NAICS code is 621511.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN 
  ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) SUBPART 
  12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. 
  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. Proposals are being requested
  and a written solicitation is available via email from robert.mayfield@pco-iraq.net. This solicitation is 
  also being posted to the PCO website www.rebuilding-iraq.net.  The Project and Contracting Office, 
  Baghdad, Iraq has a requirement for jet turbine fuel additive/inhibitor.  The quantity is 600 barrels/drums 
  assuming that each barrel/drum is 55 US gallons.  Please indicate the actual quantity that is in a
  barrel/drum.  At this time it is unknown if bulk containers are an option.  Offerors are encouraged to 
  provide an alternate proposal for bulk delivery.  If an alternate proposal is provided please give details of 
  the type container.  Offerors should indicate their minimum order quantity as well as base their 
  incremental pricing on quantities that make for full loads.   Delivery should be within 15 days 
  after a contract is awarded as a result of this solicitation. The additive should be delivered to Baghdad.  
  A complete “Ship To/Mark For” address will  be provided at the time of the contract award. This
  solicitation,  W914NS-05-R-2039, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The additive we 
  will be procuring is for turbines used for generation of  electricity. The additive will be used with Heavy 
  Fuel Oil (HFO).  It should be a product such as KI200 manufactured by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, 
  Turbotect 134, or Alpha Laval Alpacon 128. This action is unrestricted and provides for full and open 
  competition. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect 
  through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-23 and DFARS Change Notice 20040513. The associated 
  NAICS code is 424690. All interested offerors shall provide specifications in  English of the product 
  they are proposing on.  The Contracting Officer will evaluate proposals on the basis of price and technical 
  acceptability equally. Delivery schedule will be a factor of consideration as well as past performance. 
  All of these factors will be of equal importance.  Proposals must provide documentary evidence in support
  of any statements relating to promised performance. Offerors must state whether they will be able to 
  comply with delivery requirements. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation  52.216.1 Type of 
  Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm fixed  price contract(s).  Multiple awards may be 
  necessary in order to meet the delivery requirements and the schedule as well as the desire to test 
  several products to determine which one(s) works best in the application it will be used in.  It is the 
  Governments desire to request proposals for product delivered F.o.b. Baghdad, Iraq.  In order to get as 
  much competition as possible we will also accept proposals for F.o.b. Origin.  Offerors may also propose 
  other ports within Iraq such as the Port of Um Qasr.  If destinations other than Baghdad are proposed the
  Government will do an evaluation of transportation costs.  Since it is very likely that multiple awards will be 
  made it is requested that incremental pricing be offered in order that evaluation of prices can be made.

  per barrel.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items,
