<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for Pulsed LED lamp emitting at 390-410 nm with pulse widths down to 5 microsec and optical output at least 2 Watts CW equivalent. Intended for illumination of wind tunnel models coated with pressure-sensitive paint.   These items were originally posted under competitive synopsis / solicitation NNA07212044Q with two awards, one to Lightspeed Technologies (Lightspeed) and the other to Innovative Scientific Solutions, Inc (iSSI).  NASA/ARC intends to purchase one additional lamp from each company:  Lightspeed item description: UV LED driver and optics HPLS-76AD15-Kit including OH-76-0.5 optics module and an additional optics module OH-76-0.1;  iSSI item description: LM2XX-400 LED lamps, short pulsed package and DC / long pulsed drive for LM2XX Since the original solicitation, we have determined that our current wind tunnel test program will require more pulsed UV light. This need can be met by purchasing one additional lamp from each vendor.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified points of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. local time on November 26, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is a notice of a proposed contract action published to notify potential sources that The USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) contracting office intends to issue a sole source award to Oxitec Limited for the purchase of transgenic homozygous Mediterranean fruit fly strains. 

Survival, dispersal, and mating competitiveness of released fruit flies are influenced by the genetic background of the fly strain and conditions of mass-rearing, among other factors. The strains developed by Oxitec express a clearly and easily identifiable internal fluorescent marker; a stable genetic sex sorting system that eliminates greater than 95% of the females at the designated point in the rearing process; and a genetic sterilization system that kills greater than 99% of the offspring of the released males early in development.  These fruit flies will be used for the Sterile Insect control program which is the central element of ongoing eradication programs for the Mediterranean fruit fly in Mexico and Guatemala, as well as for emergency programs in the United States.  The Mediterranean fruit fly strains to be developed under this contract would use gene transfer technology to provide enhanced control by reducing the negative impact of several aspects of the rearing process and to improve the efficacy of the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal Plant Health Inspection Service Mediterranean fruit fly eradication and control programs in the United States, Mexico, and Guatemala. 

The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Numbered Note 22 applies.  Therefore, this sole source award is being made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other company will satisfy agency requirements. 

APHIS intends to award a firm fixed fee award fee contract with an estimated value of $3,750,000.00.  The contract period of performance will consist of a base period of 12 months with the option to extend the contract for an additional four years. 

Any inquires to this sole source acquisition must be submitted in writing to the attention of Corinne Nygren at USDA, APHIS Contracting, Butler Square, 5th Floor, 100 North Sixth Street, Minneapolis, MN 55403, fax 612-370-2106 or by email to Corinne.Nygren@aphis.usda.gov. Requests by telephone will not be honored.

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting proposals for the Rapid Eye program for the development of a persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) system that can be launched to anywhere in the world from an alert pad, reenter and deploy in fewer than 2 orbits and has the ability to loiter for sufficient time to allow other assets to relieve it.  The Rapid Eye program will conduct design trade studies to define an optimal system solution, perform risk reduction on critical technologies including subscale component testing, and conduct a flight test of the end-to-end Rapid Eye system.  It is envisioned that this program will at a minimum develop and demonstrate technologies associated with the design of a deployable aircraft with sufficient loiter speed, endurance and power to achieve Rapid Eye performance goals; packaging of a high-aspect ratio aircraft into a rocket fairing; the design of a re-entry decelerator with low stowed volume and mass that can slow a reentry vehicle (RV) high in the atmosphere; and the demonstration of efficient propulsion in a low oxygen, low speed environment.  The Government is not interested in solutions employing buoyant flight or radioactive power.

DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. 07-57 entitled Rapid Eye (Rapid Response, Long Endurance Unmanned Aircraft System Program), is provided as an attachment to this solicitation notice and includes information on the specific areas of interest; submission process; abstract and proposal formats; evaluation and selection/funding processes; as well as all other pertinent administrative and contractual information.  The BAA may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov or by electronic mail request to the email address given below.

Administrative, technical, or contractual questions should be sent via e-mail to BAA07-57@darpa.mil. All requests must include the name, address, and phone number of a point of contact.

<RESPDATE>122407
<ARCHDATE>11202008
<CONTACT>Nicole Haines Contract Specialist 3039692473     Nicole_Haines@nps.gov;
<DESC>General:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, intends to negotiate a sole source, Architect -Engineering Services Contract with ENTRIX, Inc, 2701 First Ave, Suite 500, Seattle, WA 98121 to acquire the below listed services.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541310, size standard $4,500,000.00  In early November 2006, Mount Rainier National Park received almost 18 inches of rainfall in 36 hours. Rivers and streams all over the park overwhelmed their channels, with floods that exceeded anything the park had experienced in its 108-year history.   The Longmire Levee protects culturally significant buildings, offices, seasonal housing, and access roads that together comprise the Longmire Historic District (a part of the Mount Rainier National Historic Landmark District). The Longmire Levee was destroyed and the banks eroded on both sides of the river.  Emergency flood control repairs were done to the levee at Longmire in the fall of 2007 to provide protection to the infrastructure on the north bank at Longmire from the anticipated normal winter flows in 2007. Significant damage was also done in the Sunshine Point vicinity which caused severe bank erosion and damage to the main roadway in the park.  Emergency repairs were done to re-open the road. The intent for this contract is to provide engineering analysis and design for additional flood control measures to improve protection of the Longmire historic area on the north bank of the Nisqually River. Work shall include additional hydrology analysis and preparation of design solutions that address the known environmental factors that combine to threaten park assets at the Longmire historic district and the Sunshine Point road.  In both areas NPS is interested in evaluating engineered logjams (ELJ's) or similar natural bank stabilization techniques.  This work will require staff that specializes in this relatively new field of bank stabilization technology.  It is also imperative that the design team have experience working on large bed-load, glacial fed rivers, unique to Mount Rainier National Park. This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures of FAR 5.201 and 6.302.  The subsequent contract will be negotiated in accordance with FAR 36.606 and FAR Part 15.  The Government believes that the identified contractor is the "only one responsible source" as defined by FAR 6.302-1 for the required Architect-Engineering services.  Firms that believe they can provide the required services described below are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice to the Contracting Officer. PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED:   1) Prepare a technical report, and develop and analyze alternatives for flood protection at Longmire and Sunshine Point. 2) Develop flood protection measures to provide long-term stabilization and protection to the existing Longmire structures on the north bank, and the park road at Sunshine Point, from future flooding.  The designs shall facilitate future maintenance of the structures.  3) Provide design calculations, drawings, and reports needed for the park staff to obtain any necessary 404/401 permits. 4) Prepare a preventative maintenance plan for the existing and proposed flood control enhancements at Longmire that includes debris disposal options and a sediment management strategy.  In the first phase of work the Contractor will be responsible for completing a project work plan, draft technical report and hydrology report, value based decision making, draft schematic design, outline specifications, Class B cost estimate, and preventative maintenance plan.  Phase II may include development of Construction Documents and construction monitoring services to assist Park construction staff.  REQUIRED DISCIPLINES: Civil, Hydrology, and Fluvial Geomorphology design/engineering specializing in engineered logjams and documentation services, surveying, geotechnical engineering will be required.  Incidental services, e.g. CADD drafting, word processing, cost estimating, etc., may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements. Firms believing they can provide the required services must provide supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements via submission of Standard Form 330, Parts I and II.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 30 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by FAX at (303) 987-6646, Attention:  Brenda Karl.  Responses should include the completed SF 330 Parts I and II, the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number and identification of the firm's business size in accordance with the size standard. Title of Project: Mount Rainier Emergency Flood Protection Description:  The work of this proposed contract action consists of fluvial geomorphology studies, design of bioengineered flood protection, for Longmire and Sunshine Point in Mount Rainier National Park.    It also includes the development of a preventative maintenance plan for Longmire. Type of Procurement: A firm-fixed A/E contract is anticipated.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   In accordance with FAR Part 12 Commercial Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. EPA ORD, National Homeland Security Research Center requires a Biocontainment Suite Commissioning in the Andrew Breidenbach Environmental Research Center Facility. In 2006, a Biocontainment Suite  was decommissioned to allow installation of a new stand alone heating and air conditioning system.  Construction entailed removal of all the old ductwork, and installation of new ductwork and air handling valaves.  The Biocontainment Suite is currently configured as a biosafety level-2 plus  laboratory.  This laboratory has new hard ducted, single pass biosafety cabinets, generator emergency power, epoxy sealed walls, and floors, its own stand alone heating and air conditioning system, double interlocking door autoclaves, and a heat inactivation tank for all liquid wastes leaving the  facility.  Now that the construction and installation of the new heating and air conditioning system is completed, the modified facility must be tested for safety. The contractor shall review the plans and drawings, the actual construction, and then test the adequacy of the Biocontainment Suite for  use as biosafety level-2 laboratory.  A written report documenting the findings of this testing will be required.  If the contractor finds that the facility is unsuitable for use at biosafety level 2, then the report shall contain detailed information specifying the corrective measures needed to  make this facility a biosafety level 2 laboratory.   This procurement will be conducted on a full and open basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541380.  Award will be made using a Best Value Analysis.  All responsible sources considering themselves qualified may submit a quote which shall be  considered by the Agency.  Any firm believing itself capable of providing the required commissioning must request a copy of the RFQ in writing within fifteen (15) days of electronic posting of this notice.  Requests should be submitted in writing to Courtney Whiting via email at  whiting.courtney@epa.gov.  Telephone responses and fax responses will not be honored.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 USC 253 (c)(1), with Coherent Laser, Inc., of Santa Clara, CA, for the purchase of a Coherent, Inc. OPO Laser System with automated active cavity length stabilization.  This laser light source will be used in the development of a video rate, Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Scattering Optical Microscope.  
  
The contemplated effort is a follow-on acquisition to continue development on a highly specialized piece of equipment as described in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  This system being procured is an upgrade to the existing equipment.  To increase the stability and usable spectral coverage of the Coherent Anti-stokes Raman Scattering Optical Microscope, NIST requires a laser source that is a direct one-to-one replacement for the Coherent Mira 900D Laser System currently in use.  

NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.  
	(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly 
specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in?
(A)	Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B)	Unacceptable delays fulfilling the agency?s requirements.
(See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B)

To procure an alternate system would require the replacement of a complete existing laser system, plus the cost of this equipment.  The Government would have to incur a total cost of approximately $1.0M which would not be recaptured or minimized by competition. 

The existing equipment and the equipment being procured are commercial items.  Coherent has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to that technology.  

The equipment being procured must be hardware and software compatible with the existing equipment.  The existing equipment and technology are proprietary to Coherent.  Coherent has no distributors, therefore, they are the only source who can successfully complete this project.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by December 6, 2007, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction & Facilities Management is looking for an Architect or Architect/Engineer (NAICS 541310) firm capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, advance planning and design of Centers for Ambulatory Care and Polytrauma Rehabilitation in the Palo Alto, CA area. Prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines be members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architects; Medical Planners; Structural, Mechanical, Geo-technical, Communication, and Electrical Engineers; Interior Designers; an independent Commissioning Agent; and Cost Estimators with experience in the planning and design of hospitals, large medical and research facilities, long term care - mental health and dementia, or similar complex healthcare projects. Selection Process: Robert T. Smoot, 202-565-4181; POC Scope: Bob Clifton, 707-562-8403. Scope:   This project will construct Centers for Ambulatory Care and Polytrauma Rehabilitation at VA Palo Alto Health Care System's (VAPAHCS) Palo Alto Division.  A 300,000 GSF Ambulatory Care Replacement Center will accommodate most Palo Alto Division ambulatory care clinics, many of which are currently located in former inpatient psychiatric buildings originally constructed in 1960.  This project will consolidate approximately 240,000 ambulatory care encounters and translational research programs into state-of-the-art? facilities.  In addition to the Ambulatory Care Replacement Center, this project will construct a 79,100 GSF Polytrauma Rehabilitative Center.  The new Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center will house both inpatient and outpatient treatment programs.  Today, Palo Alto's existing Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center is located in former inpatient psychiatric buildings originally constructed in 1960.  As one of VA's four Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers, modern treatment facilities are required to treat patients diagnosed with complex multi-trauma injuries related to combat.    This proposal will replace six (6) buildings [three (3) buildings are classified as Exceptionally High Risk (EHR) and the remaining three (3) are large, temporary clinical modular buildings].  The abatement and demolition include Buildings 4, 23, 54, and clinical Modular Buildings (MB2, MB3, MB4).  Collectively, razing these six (6) buildings will eliminate nearly 300,000 GSF of structurally deficient Exceptionally High Risk (EHR) and potentially hazardous buildings from VA Palo Alto Health Care System.   In addition to new construction and demolition, this project includes asbestos abatement, hazardous material mitigation, site restoration and the construction of a parking structure.   Landscape and other exterior revisions, associated with site work, utility feeds, cabling, impact moves and emergency generators are included within the scope of this project. Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8).  Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, along with water and energy efficiencies in design; and, in addition, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manual.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems will meet current codes and standards.  All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA's criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities.  The space will be in compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) and PG-18-13 in all areas.  Required services will include preparation of schematics and design development plans, including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines, and a firm estimate of construction cost. The contract will include a government option for: design-build RFP package or construction document preparation; construction period services, and site visits. The completed project should be capable of achieving LEEDS Silver equivalency. Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed, with additional experience with vertical expansion/integration along with phasing of on-going operations.  Emphasis will be placed on estimating capabilities and previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the firm's, or teams', Quality Assurance /Quality Control procedures. In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.   Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered. In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.   An estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction.  Applicants must have an established working office within 100 mile radius of Palo Alto, California, be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work, and be licensed in the State of California.   No firm will be considered unless an application consisting of a completed SF 330 Part I and other evidence of experience and capabilities the applicant considers relevant is received by the VA Cost Estimating and A/E Evaluation Service (00CFM1B) Attention: Robert T. Smoot, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20420, five (5) copies are required by the response date of this advertisement.  A current SF 330 Part II, representing and differentiating among the personnel, experience and capabilities of all involved offices, must be included with the application together with current SF 330 Part IIs for each proposed consultant's office involved.   Applicants will be rated based on the relevant experience - advance planning and design on projects of similar scale and scope - of both the firm(s) and assigned individuals, the applicant's capacity to do the work, record of past performance on VA work, geographic consideration, the participation of small business owned consultants, and demonstrate success in prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, energy efficiency, and systems integration in facility design.  Award of contract is dependent upon the availability of funds.  This is not a request for a proposal.  If subcontracting opportunities exist and the submitting firm is not a small business, the small business contracting goals will be:  3% (SDVOSB), 7% (VOSB), 5% (SDB), 3% (HUB Zone), 5% (WOSB), and 25% (SB).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   MODIFICATION 1-The purpose of this modification is to set this requirement aside 100% for small business.  With a small business size standard of $11 million. In accordance with FAR Part 12 Commercial Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. EPA ORD, National Homeland Security  Research Center requires a Biocontainment Suite Commissioning in the Andrew Breidenbach Environmental Research Center Facility. In 2006, a Biocontainment Suite was decommissioned to allow installation of a new stand alone heating and air conditioning system.  Construction entailed removal of all  the old ductwork, and installation of new ductwork and air handling valaves.  The Biocontainment Suite is currently configured as a biosafety level-2 plus laboratory.  This laboratory has new hard ducted, single pass biosafety cabinets, generator emergency power, epoxy sealed walls, and floors, its  own stand alone heating and air conditioning system, double interlocking door autoclaves, and a heat inactivation tank for all liquid wastes leaving the facility.  Now that the construction and installation of the new heating and air conditioning system is completed, the modified facility must be  tested for safety. The contractor shall review the plans and drawings, the actual construction, and then test the adequacy of the Biocontainment Suite for use as biosafety level-2 laboratory.  A written report documenting the findings of this testing will be required.  If the contractor finds that  the facility is unsuitable for use at biosafety level 2, then the report shall contain detailed information specifying the corrective measures needed to make this facility a biosafety level 2 laboratory.   This procurement will be 100% set aside for small business with a size standard of $11  million.  The applicable NAICS code is 541380.  Award will be made using a Best Value Analysis.  All responsible sources considering themselves qualified may submit a quote which shall be considered by the Agency.  Any firm believing itself capable of providing the required commissioning must  request a copy of the RFQ in writing within fifteen (15) days of electronic posting of this notice.  Requests should be submitted in writing to Courtney Whiting via email at whiting.courtney@epa.gov.  Telephone responses and fax responses will not be honored.

<DESC>Interpretation and translation support to the Global Threat Reduction (GTR) project, as well as other projects supporting contract work in Russia, the United States, and possible in other nations, dealing with nuclear and radiological threat reduction issues. Interpretation will primarily be consecutive interpretation of mid-to-high-level meetings, negotiations and foreign visits associated with the securing, dismantlement and disposition of industrial radioactive sources and radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Translation of contract documents exchanged daily and interpretation will primarily be English-to-Russian and Russian-to-English; however, similar support may also be required for other languages.  

Interpreting will be at sites in Russia, the United States, or other nations, as well as during weekly conference calls between the U.S. Project Team and Russian Teams.  Foreign travel, occasionally to spartan locations, will be a requirement.  Adherence to the specifications of Department of Energy (DOE) Order 551.1 B Official Foreign Travel is required, and participation in pre-travel briefings and post-travel debriefings is required, if requested.  All foreign nationals providing support will be subject to assignment under the provisions of DOE Order 142.3 Unclassified Foreign Visits and Assignments, and will thereby be required to provide additional information related to their passports and visas.  On-site interpretation support will typically require two interpreters, and in Russia, one interpreter must be included on the currently-approved Russian Federation 185 Access List.

Please submit a capabilities statement for this requirement and include a list of interpreters currently on the approved Russian Federation 185 Access List.

Market Research Survey

Introduction: The Air Force Competitive Sourcing and Privatization Division (HQ USAF/A1MS) is located in the Manpower and Organization Directorate, Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel. Their primary mission is to manage the Air Force Competitive Sourcing program and implement OMB Circular A-76, (dated 30 September 2005) and the Office of Management and Budget Circular Number A-76 (Revised May 29, 2003). 

Market research is being conducted as part of the preliminary planning phase (prior to formal public announcement) in accordance with OMB Circular A 76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of the market research is to validate the scope and grouping of functions, determine the appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, and confirm whether potential sources are available to satisfy agency requirements allowing standard public-private competition.  Small business sources will be considered in this research.  A contract may or may not result depending on the outcome of the market research and any subsequent public-private competition.  

The purpose of conducting a public-private competition is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method for providing the services required. If conducted, a public-private competition will determine whether the services will be performed under contract from commercial sources or continue to be provided by a Most Efficient Organization (MEO) of the federal workforce.  The Government contemplates the issuance of a solicitation for all or part of the service requirements defined below. 

Research Method:  A questionnaire has been specifically designed to focus on the scope of requirements of this competition.  A separate questionnaire form will be used to record market information obtained from each commercial source included in the research.

 NOTE:  This is to advise any commercial source that provides information as part of this market research process that any information provided will be protected.  This information is being collected solely to assist the government in making the determination whether or not to proceed to competition, and if so, how the functions in question would be grouped for solicitation.  Information obtained will not be used later as part of the evaluation process should a commercial source choose to submit a proposal to any solicitation that may result.  Participation is voluntary and the Government will not reimburse any company who responds to the questionnaire.

To support KPSTS mission facilities, the power plant was constructed with two each 1,100-kilowatt diesel generators.  One generator is capable of supporting the load of the entire station with some residual capacity.  The second unit is kept as a back-up.  Approximately 40,000-gallons of low sulfur diesel fuel is stored in a combination of underground and above-ground storage tanks which provides an continual runtime of about 30 days without refueling.

SCOPE: FADS will be an improved follow on to the current DVE + system. The system must be a two sensor system.  The observers sensor will be a 640 x 480 uncooled microbolometer with an 18-20 degree field of view.  The drivers sensor will be a 640 x 480 uncooled microbolometer with 40 x 30 degree field of view. The observers sensor must be mounted with a variable speed electronic pan and tilt system with a minimum slew rate of 35 degrees per second and a centering capability of at lease 45 degrees per second with a stand alone controller.  Faster panning speeds without image blur are desirable. The system must provide an interface for an image data recorder. The required local area processing must be able to be turned on and off by the user. Both the driver and the observer must have the ability to view the inputs from either of the two sensors using controls inside the vehicle. The system must have a sensor positioning icon on the observers display and also on the drivers display when the driver switches to the observers sensor. The icon will indicate the relative position of the sensor to the vehicle. The drivers and observers DCM must be compatible with the DVE ICD. The system must remain within the DVE + space claim. The power draw for the system must not exceed 96 Watts at max load. The system design must mitigate image jitter. Each system must be able to be completely installed and operationally ready using 4 man hours or less. The system must enable opening the hood of a vehicle equipped with FADS within one minute and the ability to close the hood and resume FADS operation also within one minute. In addition, desirable system capabilities are electronic zoom and an image data recording capability. The intended vehicle platform is the M1114 or M1151.  The proposal must be a mature system concept that must reach full-rate production within three months of contract award. It is desirable for first article delivery within six weeks of contract award.  A t least 5034 systems must be delivered to the government and installed by December 31, 2008.

The intended vehicle platform for integration of this product capability is the HMMWV.  The government is primarily interested in products with technologically mature sensor systems that include day and night camera capabilities.  Additionally, responses provided should addres s industrys ability to commence high rate monthly production within 3 months from contract award leading to delivery and platform installation of 5034 systems on or before the end of calendar year 2008.  System Configuration:  The government envisions that FADS will be an improved follow on to the Driver Vision Enhancement Plus system currently being produced in limited quantities by DRS, Inc, FL under contract Number W15P7T-04-C-J202. FADS improvements include a separate sensor for an observer in the back of the vehicle with an associated video display. This sensor will have an adjustable focal length capability. Both users, driver and observer, will have the ability to employ electric pan and tilt controls. System Capabilities: It is envisioned that the FADS will operate in urban, rural, and off road terrains.  Additionally, the FADS will be used to detect activities which may indicate Improvised Explosive Device (IED) emplacement and /or employment. The syst em must be able to allow an observer to continuously scan threat areas around the vehicle from the ground level to roof tops of three story buildings to detect a human at ranges up to 500 meters using multiple fields of view.  The observer must be able to independently pan and tilt the sensor(s) which will be able to operate in both day and night conditions as well as degraded visibility conditions (smoke, fog, haze, rain, dust, etc).  Additionally, the FADS must be able to record activities associated with  IED emplacement or an attack on the vehicle for review at a later time.  The system must meet the most current version of MIL-STD-461, Electromagnetic Interference.  FADS components must be able to be removed and placed on another vehicle quickly in a tac tical environment without the need for special tools.   Power requirements must be supported by current onboard power generation equipment with a fully combat configured M1114 or M1151.  In the event said power requirements cannot be met, adequate power ge neration must be part of the FADS design itself Current System Specs: FADS system elements must as capable as currently fielded DVE and DVE Plus systems.  Specifications for the DVE Plus PTM with Quickset PTM in clude:  Weight: 15.5 pounds; Height: 13.25 inches; Width:  9.5 inches; Depth:  5.25 inches. For the FLIR Sensor:  Band 8-12 microns  long wave; Detector  640x480; NET:  less than or equal to 35milliKelvins; Cooling: Uncooled; Focal Length: 7mm (40 degrees) Other considerations:  The government is seeking low cost, non-developmental item/commercially available low cost solution for FADS.  The system must be operable by a skill level 1 military member. When considering price estimates respondents are requested  to address complete system unit cost including all components, training, delivery, maintenance and installation impacts based on use of combat configured M1114 or M1151. Interested sources are requested to provide complete descriptions of existing products or those that will be available for delivery within the timeframe indicated above.  Industry responses must include sufficient documentation to support any claims that t heir system performance will meet the minimum performance capabilities contained herein. Such documentation may include system technical specifications, product brochures and related literature, performance test data, system drawings and/or photographs, or  any other data to support the state of system development and or production readiness.  Additionally, industry responses are to specifically include an outline of supply chain considerations with emphasis on any known long lead items that may adversely im pact high rate production in an accelerated environment.  Any limitations to ramping up to high rate monthly production and system integration considerations must be addressed along with proposed resolutions to potential production impediments.  Industry r esponses should also submit their projected monthly production capabilities to include critical subcontractor and vendor production capacity along with estimated unit prices assuming a notional 31 Dec 08 completion date for delivery of 5034 items. Responses to this RFI are due by 4:00pm on 13 September 2007.  Technical questions and industry responses are to be sent via email to Patrick Schertler at patrick.schertler@conus.army.mil.  All material submitted in response to this RFP must be unclassified.  Interested parties possessing the capacity to deliver products meeting the requirements outlined above are requested to provide a White Paper describing: 1.	Corporate capabilities, past and current relevant performance information, available facilities and assets   2.	Technical and management approach for executing a FADS program to include a detailed design; procurement of subsystems and components and the integration of sensor components; rigorous contractor  test and integration data;  supporting technical documen tation; and, operational and sustainment considerations 3.	A cost estimate on a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to meet or exceed the notional requirements outlined above. 4.	A supporting program schedule that represents a low risk approach to meeting the objectives outlined above. 5.	An assessment of the associated risks for this program and respective risk mitigation approaches. 6.	Name, telephone number, fax number, street address and e-mail address for Program, Technical and Cost points of contact information. The Government may afford interested parties an opportunity to discuss the contents of their White Papers during an industry one-on-one session where it is envisioned the parties will engage in an active information exchange dialogue to aid in the governme nts feasibility assessment. Additionally, the government may allow interested parties an opportunity to provide a demonstration of their FADS solution.  It is anticipated that any such sessions would not exceed 8 hours, including installation and de-insta llation, and will take place at either at Fort Belvoir, VA and/or at Fort A.P. Hill, VA.

<SUBJECT>R -- Insurance in Canada and Mexico
<DESC>The following is a request for information (RFI) regarding insurance products for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This is a market survey for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a request for proposals or quotes or as imposing any obligation on the part of the government.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement. 


**BACKGROUND: 

The EPA is responsible for responding to environmental emergencies, including releases of oil and hazardous substances due to accidents, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other causes. EPA has agreements with agencies in Canada and Mexico to support each other for incidents that may occur along shared international borders. These agreements call for EPA personnel and equipment to enter into Canada and Mexico to respond to environmental emergencies. EPA also works with Mexican and Canadian counterparts to perform joint exercises of contingency plans and to discuss preparedness and response issues. These planning and preparedness activities also necessitate cross-border travel of EPA personnel and equipment.  

When entering Canada or Mexico, EPA personnel may, on occasion, be required to provide proof of insurance that covers vehicles and any potential liabilities that may emerge from the operation of U.S. government vehicles and the actions of U.S. government personnel on Mexican or Canadian soil.  For example, the Government of Canada requires proof of insurance when U.S. government vehicles are driven into Canada to attend planning meetings, participate in exercises, or respond to actual releases on the border (usually in a waterway/river).  Before allowing U.S. government personnel and equipment to enter the country, Canada requires that EPA personnel provide proof of primary coverage from a third-party insurance company or broker. 

    **REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information regarding the types of insurance products EPA could purchase that will enable it to perform the functions described above.  EPA invites all interested parties to submit responses and information about insurance products or services that might meet EPAs operational needs.  

The following general guidelines are provided:  EPA anticipates the need for up to 18 EPA vehicles to cross the border into Canada on an annual basis, with five or fewer vehicles in Canada at any one time.  Some of these vehicles could include specialized equipment. The maximum duration of each trip depends on the circumstances, ranging from a few days for planning meetings to weeks or months for responses to environmental emergencies.  Up to 100 personnel could be involved over a years period. EPA anticipates similar needs for Mexico.

Responses to this RFI should include discussion of: (1) price ranges for products/services with a description of factors contributing to price variations;  (2) the feasibility or desirability of having an insurance policy for Mexico and Canada separately or combined.  (3) the effect of timing, e.g., purchasing such products or services on a government fiscal year basis (Oct. 1 through Sep. 30), and purchasing partial year coverage, e.g., Jan. 1, 2008 through Sep. 30, 2008; (4)the possibility and price of a $2,000,000 limit of liability per occurrence with accident benefits per statutory requirements; (5)  the possibility and price of a Permission to Rent or Lease Endorsement and a Blanket Basis Fleet Endorsement; (5) any additional information that industry might find necessary or useful in an RFQ for such products or services; (6)any exclusions or conditions that would help EPA properly compare products; (7) respondent's name, address, phone number, and point of contact information.

Please limit responses to no more than 5 pages.  

Proprietary information is not being requested; however, if it is included it should be identified as such. All materials submitted in response to this RFI will become the property of the government.

<SUBJECT>A -- Domestic Suppliers for Trusted Integrated Circuit (IC) Services
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA)to identify interested vendors based on the information below.

In an effort to combat risks and threats to the integrity of the integrated circuit supply chain, the Department of Defense has established a program through which the onshore suppliers of integrated circuits may seek accreditation as "Trusted Suppliers".  The Trusted Integrated Circuit (IC) program encompasses the entire IC supply chain including Design, Aggregation/Brokering, Mask Making, Fabrication, Packaging and Test. A current facility clearance or the ability and willingness to obtain one is required.

The Defense MicroElectronics Activity (DMEA) has been designated by the Department of Defense through the Trusted Access Program Office (TAPO) as the accrediting authority for this program.

In October 2003 the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) issued the Defense Trusted Integrated Circuits Strategy (DTICS) that established "Trust" as a minimum need for DOD. Interim Guidance from the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD/AT&L, dated 27 January 2004) initiated development of policy that requires all Mission Assurance Category I systems (DODI 8500.2) to "employ only trusted foundry service(s) to fabricate their custom designed ICs". As a result, the new vendor criteria issued to DoD Program Managers has increased the need for trusted parts and the subsequent expansion of the Trusted Foundry Program. The OUSD/AT&L, through TAPO and DMEA, is implementing an accreditation plan for design, aggregator/broker, mask and wafer fabrication, packaging and test services across a broad technology range for specialized governmental applications both classified and unclassified.

Vendors who are interested in receiving accreditation pursuant to providing these services are asked to contact DMEA, preferably by email, at the address below.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Intent to Award to a Sole Source:  Identity Card Laminate
<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to award a sole source contract to Datacard Group, Inc. of Minnetonka, Minnesota.

The purpose of the contract award is to provide identity card laminate, which the firm has previously developed to support the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program.  The purpose of this TSA program is to enroll and issue a secure uniform credential to the Maritime population in accordance with the Safe Port Act dated October 13, 2006.  Datacard has the unique holographic laminate which contains customized features, and is used on a card printer that is manufactured by Datacard.
 
Currently, TSA is in the critical phase of the TWIC deployment.  Datacard is considered to the most advantageous source for the Government due to the following:  

1) Compatibility of the laminate material and laminate spool with existing personalization system components of the TWIC System that are already being utilized to print cards, and 
2) The additional cost and development time of procuring a customized laminate from another source in a short timeframe.  Therefore, Datacard Group, Inc. is the only vendor available that can meet all the requirements and supply this product for the TWIC System.

This announcement constitutes the intentions of the TSA to enter into a contract with Datacard Group, Inc., on a single source basis, in accordance with the TSA Acquisition Management System.  Alternative products will not be considered.  This is notice of contract action and is not a request for competitive proposals; no formal solicitation will be issued as a result of this announcement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This small business set-aside procurement is being made in accordance with the procedures in FAR Parts 12 and 15. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) will award a single Firm Fixed-Price Contract with a period of performance of six months. The solicitation number is HSCG23-08-R-HPH006 and it is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) under NAICS Code 541611: Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services. The solicitation document, and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-20.

1.1 SCOPE:
The United States Coast Guard (USCG) currently has a need for Contractor support in developing a Strategic Master Plan for a new National Coast Guard Museum. The plan will include but not limited to the following: Vision and Mission, Site Analysis, Market Analysis, Operations, Organization and Staffing and a Milestone Plan. The Final Strategic Master Plan shall be developed within six months from the date of contract award. This will be a Performance-Based Acquisition. 

1.2 BACKGROUND:
The USCG, one of the United States (U.S.) five armed services, is one of the only armed services without a National Museum.  The proposed new National Museum would provide a facility to educate visitors about the USCG?s rich maritime heritage and its 216-year history of providing Homeland Security and maritime rescues around the world. 

The current USCG Museum is located in one wing of Waesche Hall, at the USCG Academy Library in New London, Connecticut.  It has been at this location for the past 25 years. This museum has approximately 5,000 square feet of space for storage, exhibits, and administrative duties.  As a result of the limited space, it cannot display large artifacts or traveling exhibits.  In addition, most of the USCG?s artifacts are either in storage or on loan to other institutions (e.g., the Coast Guard Exhibit Center in Forestville, Maryland). The USCG Academy currently provides funding for all utilities, maintenance, and security.  Currently, the museum has one full-time employee, and approximately 20 part-time volunteers. The United States Coast Guard Museum Feasibility, Programming, and Siting Study concluded that the current museum is far below the space required for such a facility, even with its present visitation.  This museum serves approximately 20,000 visitors annually.

As noted by a Coast Guard Historian, ?the Coast Guard has served our Nation for over 210 years?yet the public, as well as the men and women in today?s Service, has little idea how these watchwords [Honor, Respect, and Devotion to Duty] are spliced with the Service?s past? (Browning 2001).  To a great extent, this situation arises from the inadequacy of the current USCG Museum.  

The primary goal of the proposed new National Museum is to educate visitors about the USCG?s rich maritime heritage and unique contribution to Homeland Security, and to properly store, preserve, and display USCG artifacts. Additionally, the proposed new National Museum should pose minimal financial and operational risk to the USCG and the U.S. Furthermore, development of the surrounding property should be supportive of and consistent with a museum and museum goals. 

The new National Coast Guard Museum is slated to be built in New London, Connecticut and it is anticipated that it will be anywhere between 40,000 to 60,000 sq. ft.

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support Division (PS)  provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM)  is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a two (2) month bridge contract extension to extend contract N00189-01-D-0291 for husbanding services with Chile in order to complete the formulation of a regional husbanding service provider contract in 2007.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices is anticipated.  This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.

The follow-on requirement to this current contract has not been issued and a regional  husbanding service provider contract is anticipated.  NAVSUP has taken the initiative to re-engineer the husbanding process.  A worldwide husbanding conference was held in February 2006 in Norfolk, VA that included representatives from Government and commercial industry.  The purpose was to discuss current husbanding processes and future logistic initiatives within the U.S. Navy and work to better align their goals with new contracts.  This conference led to the development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 31 January 2008.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a two (2) month bridge contract extension to extend contract N00189-01-D-0018 for husbanding services with St. Maarten in order to complete the formulation of a regional husbanding service provider contract in 2007.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices is anticipated.  This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.

The follow-on requirement to this current contract has not been issued and a regional North and South American husbanding service provider contract is anticipated.  NAVSUP has taken the initiative to re-engineer the husbanding process.  A worldwide husbanding conference was held in February 2006 in Norfolk, VA that included representatives from Government and commercial industry.  The purpose was to discuss current husbanding processes and future logistic initiatives within the U.S. Navy and work to better align their goals with new contracts.  This conference led to the development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 31 January 2008.

This conference led to the development of a Process Action Team (PAT) with members from across the NAVSUP claimancy.  The PAT team met all year to research current processes in delivery, contract types, bill payment, and scope of work to name a few.  New themes such as Operations Other Than War and Humanitarian relief also needed to be addressed so that new contracts could better respond to major disasters like Hurricane Katrina or Tsunami relief in Asia.  The PAT resulted in a plan of action approval to pilot new solicitations for North and South America.  This bridge extension will allow FISCN to pursue this new contract.  The estimated time of contract award will be no later than 31 January 2008.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a seven (7) month bridge contract extension to extend contract N68836-03-D-0021 for husbanding services with Puerto Rico in order to develop and compete a regional Continental United States (CONUS) husbanding service provider contract in 2007/2008.  An Indefinite Delivery/Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices is anticipated.  This acquisition will be negotiated pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by Section 6.302-1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501 (a), a Sole Source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.

<DESC>A-NIST-Preparation, Submission and Prosecution of a Non-Provisional Patent Application for the Office of Technology
Partnerships (OTP).
Description:
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services
prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13,
as supplemental with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation,
quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation
will not be issued.  Solicitation Number NB20020-8-00021 is issued as a request for quotation. The North American Industry
Classification Code (NAICS) is 54110.  The NIST Technology Services Laboratory has a requirement for preparation, submission
and prosecution of a Non-Provisonal Patent Applications and
a Accelerated Patent Application for the following National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Invention.
Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the
Contractor shall provide services in accordance with the
Statement of Work (SOW), Preparation, Submission and Prosecution
of a Non-Provisional Patent Application and Accelerated Patent
Application, dated August 2007. Specifically, the Contractor
shall complete the following tasks:
IV. TASK:
TASK 1.Conduct all supporting research that, in the professional
judgement of the Contractor, is necessary to prepare a non-provisional U.S. patent application. This shall include but
not be limited to the following: (a.)Review of all technical
material submitted by the NIST inventor concerning the invention
with the inventor(s). (b.)Render an opinion concerning the pat-
entability of the invention.
TASK 2.Prepare the patent application and all necessary supporting documentation in preparation for filing at the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This will be accomplished
with final approval on patent application content rendered by
the first NIST inventor as named on the application.
TASK 3.File non-provisional patent application with USPTO. This
shall include but not be limited to the following: (a.)Contractor
shall file the patent application with all pertinent ink drawings
and diagrams with transmittal papers with the USPTO along with
an executed Declaration and Power of Attorney, and shall report
the completion of this action to the NIST Technical Information Contact (TIC). (b.)Contractor shall request the Information
Disclosure Statement when the application is filed. (d.)Contractor shall send to the NIST TIC an electronic copy of
the invention's non-provisional patent applications as filed
with the USPTO immediately after the application's filing.
TASK 4. Election and preparation  of Response to Restriction
Requirements: (a.)Contractor shall provide an Analysis Letter
to accompany the Response to First Office Action to include
receipt, review, reporting, preparation and filing of response
and reporting. (b.)Contractor shall  provide an Analysis Letter

Application. (d.)Contractor shall receipt, review and provide
to the NIST TIC Reporting of Notice of Allowability. (e.)Contractor shall review the file wrapper for any outstanding
items and resolve any outstanding issues with the USPTO.
V. Deliverables
The highly variable nature of the patent process and the large,
diverse number of necessary interim work products often required
to support the preparation, submission and prosecution of a
patent application, make it difficult to specify the exact
number, type and content or these work products or to prepare
a schedule for their production and delivery.

NIST understands that decisions to prepare these interim 
products are within the realm of a patent attorney's 
professional practice and dictated by what the attorney
believes to be the "best professional practice" in the
client's interest.  No time schedule or list of work products
can possible anticipate all of the contingencies that can arise
during the patent prosecution that require such products.
Nevertheless, the following deliverable products have been
identified for production and delivery t the intended recipients
during this contract: V.1-Non-Provisional Patent Application
suitable for timely submission t the USPTO with all required
supporting forms, declarations and other documentation.
V.2-All submissions, e.g.,amendments t the application, 
prepared by the Contractor in response to first, second and 
subsequent office actions taken during the patent prosecution
by the USPTO. V.3-All supporting drawings and diagrams intended
for filing with the Non-Provisional Patent Application or in 
response to subsequent office actions. V.4-Appellate documents
files after Final Office Action. V.5-The Contractor's case
file for the entire patent prosecution, to include all attorney
correspondence with the USPTO.
VI. Period of Performance:
The period of performance for this contract is five (5) years
from the effective date of award, but may be extended as 
necessary by NIST for an additional option period of five
(5) years.
A firm-fixed-price quotation for the SOW requirements that
traces back to the proposed SOW, and work breakdown structure.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical 

emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor?s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).


ATTACHMENT B

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9 Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 ?smart card? IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new ?smart card? IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be 

granted to any of USAID?s information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
