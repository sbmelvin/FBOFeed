<DESC>Hypersonic weapons are anticipated to provide revolutionary warfighting capabilities. The Department of the Air Force is in the planning stage for a research program focused on the technical maturation for materials and process (M&amp;P) and related materials behavior and life prediction in extreme environments expected in hypersonic flight. Technology options are sought to reduce the risks associated with acquisition decisions for a notional expendable hypersonic vehicle (EHV) in the 2020 timeframe. Two concepts are being considered. The first is a hypersonic cruise missile with an onboard airbreathing propulsion system to maintain hypersonic velocities. The second is a boost glide (BG) weapon with a higher initial velocity to maintain hypersonic gliding flight. Both weapon concepts will be launched from an aircraft and will be designed to achieve similar mission objectives. To support the near-term weapon system transition focus, specific M&amp;P and behavior and life prediction technology options that have the highest payoff by solving critical problems or significantly lowering risk associated with the anticipated weapon system acquisition should be emphasized.

It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.

Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. The required quantity is 1250 each with no option shipping to SW3215 Barstow, CA 92311-5014. FOB destination and inspection at destination are required. This solicitation will be available on the internet at http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 02/09/16. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery and past performance. The required delivery is 183 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. All interested parties may submit an offer.<br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br />Submission of proposal by electronic commerce (e-mail) is allowed. E-mailed proposal shall not be transmitted directly to the contracting officer. Submit e-mailed proposals to the Bid and Abstract Room at: ContractorProposalDLALandandMaritime@dla.mil.

 If the offeror previously had an active CCR/ORCA account the offerors information has automatically been incorporated into the SAM database.

The exact dates and location of the pre-proposal conference/site visit will be provided in the RFP.

Attendees are responsible for their own travel arrangements.  Failure to submit all required information by 11 February 2016, at 4:00 p.m. HST will preclude a firms eligibility to participate in the pre-proposal conference and site visit. 

Each pre-proposal conference/site-visit request must include the following information: full name of attendee(s), name of firm represented by attendee(s) and, position/title, telephone number and e-mail address of attendee(s). Request needs to note if the representative will be attending the pre-proposal conference, site visit or both.

<SUBJECT>Y--INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) MULTIPLE AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT (MACC) FOR CONSTRUCTION OF COMMERCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FACILITIES FOR NAVAL SPECIAL WARFARE COMMAND 
<SOLNBR>N6247316R3201
<CONTACT>Matt Koontz 619-556-8160
<DESC>This procurement is for a multiple award construction contract (MACC) and is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition. This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation covering both phases with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to responsible offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the best value, price and other factors considered. Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone firms, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4.

This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.
 The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his/her properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractors. Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, renovation, and repair, by design-build or design-bid-build, of general building construction for Naval Special Warfare Command at the Coastal Campus, Naval Base Coronado, California. The area of coverage may also extend throughout the entire Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) Area of Operations (AOR) as approved by the NAVFAC Southwest (SW) Chief of Contracting Office (CCO).
 Types of projects may include, but are not limited to: administration buildings, maintenance/repair facilities, operations facilities, logistics facilities, fire stations, office buildings, laboratories, dining facilities, and related structures.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, and the annual size standard is $36.5 million. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $500,000,000. Task orders will range between $13,000,000 and $50,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract.
 The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.

The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2 - Experience, and Factor 3 - Past Performance; Phase Two: Factor 4 - Safety; Factor 5  Technical Solution, Factor 6  Energy and Sustainable Design, Factor 7  Small Business, and Factor 8 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).

Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.
 No site visit will be held, and no formal pre-proposal conference will be conducted. THE SOLICITATION AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and/or the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about February 10, 2016. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.

Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above. A sources sought notice was posted on September 3, 2015 on NECO and FBO, and a market survey was conducted that included an assessment of relevant qualifications and capabilities of potentially qualified firms.
 As a result of the market research analysis, a determination was made to solicit this procurement on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition, with one contract reserved for a highly qualified small business. The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) San Diego District Office and the NAVFAC SW small business office concur with this decision.

The requirement is for medical simulation training support services for the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) Medical Readiness Training Command (MRTC) and their supported units. MRTC is the USAR command tasked to provide pre-deployment readiness training to medical units throughout the USAR, the Active Army Component and DOD. The MRTC provides various levels of training to units throughout the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) cycle and certifies medical units for readiness prior to deployment to a combat theater. The contractor shall provide MRTC and the units to be trained access to a simulation center and any associated classrooms, meeting rooms or storage areas located at the simulation center six times per year on the scheduled training dates, which will fall on four consecutive days beginning on a Friday and ending on Monday. The simulation center will provide medical training in emergency room, intensive care unit, endovascular care and similar clinical environments. The simulation areas shall include clinical equipment such as anesthesia machines, ventilators, defibrillators, perfusion simulator and high-fidelity computer directed manikins to provide high tech realism to the simulated medical events. The simulation center shall have the ability to simulate the flow of patients normally encountered in a deployed contingency operations environment which are flowing through the echelons of medical care from points of injury to initial damage control surgical capabilities (Forward Surgical Team) or to more definitive care facilities and capabilities of the Combat Support Hospital; that care will involve initial triage and management of multisystem trauma patients with injuries observed in a combat situation (massive blast injuries to include multiple limb amputations) as well as patients of varying degree of acuity to fully task and train the entire health care team, and that the training simulates a combat situation to stress the teams and to provide them an atmosphere to focus on improving team work and communication using the Team STEPPs framework. Team STEPPS is an evidence-based set of teamwork tools, aimed at optimizing patient outcomes by improving communication and teamwork skills among health care professionals. It was created jointly by the Department of Defense and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; it is now a mandatory training requirement for all deploying Army medical units. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611310. The HRCO (P) intends to award a contract no later than February 4, 2016. It is anticipated that the IDIQ contract will have a base ordering period of February 5, 2016 through February 4, 2017 and two 12-month option periods through February 4, 2019.

Additionally, the market research will assist the Government in determining which acquisition vehicle can be used to best meet the requirements as indicated in the Draft PWS. GSA intends on determining the availability of capable small and large businesses on a various schedules, established vehicles or open market sources.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND:	<br /> <br />DMDC is part of the Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA), which is a Department of Defense (DoD) Field Activity.  DMDC maintains the central and authoritative store of personnel, manpower, training, and security data for the DoD.  The personnel data holdings, in particular, are broad in scope and date back to the early 1970's, covering all uniformed services, all components of the total force (active, guard, reserve, and civilian), and all phases of the personnel life cycle (accessions through separation/retirement).  The categories of data archived at DMDC represent significant data holdings and, in most cases, provide the only single source of common data on the uniformed services.  These data support decision-making by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) (OUSD [P&amp;R]), other OSD organizations, and a wide variety of customers both within and outside the DoD.  <br />Research in personnel security, surveys and testing has been a cornerstone of Personnel and Readiness (P&amp;R) for many years.  Through the consolidation of PERSEREC by DMDC in 2013 the main research hub transitioned with the consolidation.  Since 2000 in-depth research has been conducted while establishing a baseline for critical data as all levels within the DoD.  Currently we are conducting research in areas of personnel security, surveys and testing in direct support of the DoD worldwide.  As the demographics change and the world changes it is much more prevalent to conduct varying degrees of research to ensure decision makes have firsthand knowledge in areas such as, but not limited to  espionage, social media, cyber security, ASVAB Psychometric Analysis and surveys of various degrees.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK:</p>
<p>Provided within this RFI, is a DRAFT PWS, which is being used for planning purposes. The requirements listed in the PWS are subject to change, if and when a solicitation is posted. Responders to this RFI are encouraged to review the PWS, in its entirety, and provide the requested information indicated below as their Capability Statement response.</p>

<DESC>National Security Technologies, LLC is seeking sources that are interested in providing Lease office and laboratory space in the Santa Barbara/Goleta area, approximately 56,765 sqft, meeting the below requirements:<br />Background: <br />The US Department of Energy has had a contractor run scientific and electronics research and development (R&amp;D) operation in the Santa Barbara/Goleta, CA area since 1958. This location was originally chosen due to its proximity to high quality universities (UCSB, UCLA, USC, Cal Poly), the Pacific Ocean for testing instrumentation in an aquatic environment, and a location that would be attractive to high end R&amp;D scientists and engineers. These original reasons are still valid today. Special collaborations have also been set up with UCSB including a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Science and Technology Research and Development, internship programs and Post Doctorial studies. The work location and unique research and development experiments at Santa Barbara (STL), has attracted a highly specialized work force. <br />NSTec/STL leased space includes laboratories, specialized experimental areas, offices, and conference rooms to complete its applied research and development mission. A multidiscipline laboratory, STL contributes significantly to critical NSTec programs in support of the NNSA mission. In addition to support of NNSA and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) direct programs, STL serves a number of other federal agencies through the Strategic Partnership Projects (SPP) and the Strategic Intelligence Partnership Projects (SIPP). STL provides engineering design, rapid prototyping, and deployment of advanced sensor and detection systems and instrumentation in support of efforts to combat terrorism. Specialized software is also developed for Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) applications.<br />Facility Requirements: <br />The Ekwill Street buildings are a combination of office and laboratory space that house most of STL's direct science and engineering staff as well as the management and support staff for the laboratory. Modifications to the current building were approved and completed to meet the unique mission needs of the laboratory and to meet enhanced security requirements.<br />Facility security requirements and enhancements include the following:<br />&bull; Building exterior and interior door access control systems.<br />&bull; Security cameras and alarms covering the exterior and interior of both buildings.<br />&bull; Security enhancements to significant portions of the leased space for use in classified operations and/or accredited SCIF operations.<br />&bull; Network cabling throughout all leased space to meet DOE security and IT requirements.
<p>Programmatic facility requirements include the following:<br />&bull; RF shielded anechoic chamber at least 465 sqft in size for instrumentation development and testing.<br />&bull; Class IV laser laboratories with interlocks, warning lights and other engineering control measures to meet ANSI Laser Safety requirements. At least nine separate laboratories are needed for a total of 3550 sqft.<br />&bull; High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered ventilation systems for 2600 sqft of optics laboratories.<br />&bull; High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered ventilation system for a 230 sqft clean room.<br />&bull; Electronic laboratories - 8275 sqft with electrostatic discharge flooring in at least 1575 sqft<br />&bull; Ventilation hood for small scale chemical operations.<br />&bull; Environmental testing laboratories - 390 sqft.<br />&bull; Conference rooms - 4085 sqft capable of holding classified discussions.<br />&bull; Office space - 11,600 sqft for R&amp;D operations.<br />&bull; Machine shop - 1115 sqft for prototype machining operations.<br />&bull; Additional HVAC systems in computer and data rooms to protect servers and routers from high temperatures.<br />&bull; Leased space must be fully protected by an automatic fire suppression system meeting the NFPA and DOE/NNSA requirements.</p>
<p>Estimated Need: <br />STL anticipates it will continue to need approximately 56,765 sqft of the leased property in the Santa Barbara/Goleta area by May 31, 2017. Period of performance is for 5-years.</p>

<DESC>Requirement:
<p>SOCOM needs the capability to locally manage &amp; disseminate its foundation, map, and imagery (geospatial) data throughout the SOCOM AOR. SOCOM needs to provide current/relevant/updated/near real-time geospatial data (vector, raster, and elevation) to SOCOM geospatial customers within a two hour timeframe (upon notification) on multiple deployable external data drives (SD card, thumb drive, external hard drive) and domains (SIPR, NIPR). Data to be disseminated needs to be selectable via a Graphical User Interface using a "rubber-band" style selection tool and a Map of the region of the world involved. Once selected, the size of the potential data to be transferred to the external drive will be displayed so that a decision can be made to transfer the data or redraw the area to be transferred, or if there are multiple layers, determine which layers are not necessary, prior to transfer being initiated. The solution needs to be capable of managing and disseminating large volumes of geospatial data &lt;&lt;definition of large volume?&gt;&gt; over the network to include bandwidth-disadvantaged users operating on SOF Deployable Network - Medium/Light (SDN-M/L). Access to the data needs to be obtained using map/imagery data software and /or web browser.</p>
<p>Solution needs to be Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) interoperable with map &amp; imagery displaying software and provide Keyhole Markup Language (KML) services. The solution must allow for seamless integration and usage with GOTS/COTS exploitation and visualization software and tools. These must include FalconView, RemoteView, SOCET GXP, ArcGIS, ENVI, Google Earth, Palantir, ERDAS and the Global Command and Control System (GCCS). Additionally, the solution must allow for user defined outputs to all DoD standard geospatial formats, to include, NITF, GEOTIFF, MRSID, PNG, JPEG2000, JPG, ERDAS.IMG, and others.<br />The solution must provide the ability to generate custom deployable drives containing data and web services (KML and OGC) for disconnected users. SOF users and analysts often operate in austere locations with limited or non-existent connectivity. Upon CIF deployment analysts must have the ability to conduct planning and analysis en-route to operational location without communication infrastructure. Having a self-contained, deployable drive that can provide OGC and KML services to disconnected, mobile, and multiple users is paramount. Data managers must be able to create a drive which is usable by COTS/GOTS tools that are KML and OGC compliant.</p>
<p>The solution must have the ability to provide real-time updating of existing data layers without disrupting live services. It must allow the on-site data manager to seamlessly upload, patch, and update foundation base layers without disconnecting access to web services or requiring the data source to be modified and/or replaced. The solution must allow on-site analysts to maintain the data and serve as the data manager with limited excessive effort. The solution should provide a reduced data management option that simplifies maintenance/updates and still maintains optimum performance.</p>
<p>Justification:</p>
<p>Currently, SOCOM doesn't have this capability resident at the Enterprise level. Each TSOC and component are researching and attempting to fund solutions independently, with at least one organization that currently funds this capability themselves to meet their mission requirements. The current Enterprise mapping arch is insufficient to meet the current and future needs of the enterprise. During the GEOINT WG in April 2014 at SOCOM, all of the TSOCs and Components present echoed their desire to gain a similar capability.</p>
<p>As of today, the SOCOM organizations do not have a capability that meets their enterprise and disconnected requirement to provide GEOINT data and visualization services to tactical SOF operations.</p>
<p>Who requires service/system?<br />TSOCs, SOCOM Components, a SOCOM Enterprise need</p>
<p>Estimated Number of People Affected?<br />Significant</p>
<p>Which network will the service or system be applied? <br />SIPR/NIPR</p>

<p>Facility. The Contractor facility shall be cleared to the Secret level at the start of this task. The Contractor shall ensure requirements for safeguarding classified information and classified materials; for obtaining and verifying personnel security clearances; for verifying security clearances and indoctrination of visitors; for controlling access to restricted areas; for protecting government property; and for the security of automated and non-automated management information systems and data; are fulfilled.

Also see contract clauses 5652.204-9003, Disclosure of Unclassified Information (2007), and DFARS 252.204-7000, Disclosure of Information.</p>
<p>Proprietary Information (PI) Protection. This effort will require the contractor to be responsible for a significant amount of technical documentation that is proprietary to hardware device and software manufacturers. Past contracts heavily relied on the contractor being provided with proprietary technical documentation in order to develop new equipment training documentation and in support of the operational employment of devices. The contractor will be required to ensure they have implemented the necessary procedures to ensure device OEM's PI is properly safeguarded.</p>
<p><br /><br />Questions for Industry. If your organization has the potential capability and capacity to perform these contract services, please assist the government by providing the following:</p>
<p>1) Contact information for someone in the company with whom the government can follow-up (name, phone number, email address, website address) <br />2) Business Size of the company (Small or large, and any socio economic qualifications i.e. woman owned, Veteran Owned) <br />3) Capability statement tailored to the particulars of this effort with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. <br />4) Describe corporate experience with delivering this type of specialized support on past or present contracts.<br />5) Identify challenges and risks from an industry perspective that are associated with performing a similar effort with which your company has experience.<br />6) From a high level, what approach would your company take to deliver the services to SOF?<br />7) From your corporate experience what other considerations should the government account for when developing requirements for these services?</p>

<p>This antiviral medicine is required for the National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS) for pandemic and avian influenza preparedness. The USDA APHIS NVS requires sufficient quantities of antivirals be available to protect NVS response personnel in the event of a pandemic to ensure the continuity of essential services for the overall critical mission. The antiviral must be administered orally in the form of a gel-cap. Tamiflu has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and demonstrated by the Centers for Disease Control to be effective in treating Influenza A, H1N1 Influenza and H5N1 Avian Influenza. It is the only antiviral medicine shown to be effective for this purpose that can be administered orally in the form of a pill or capsule.</p>
<p>The USDA APHIS intends to issue a commercial indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contract for the supply of Tamiflu. The anticipated contract will include a base period and four option years. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any interested parties capable of providing Tamiflu are encouraged to submit capability information to Lisa Draves at lisa.a.draves@aphis.usda.gov. Telephonic inquiries will not be honored. Closing date for submission of capability information is 09 February 2016. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>Mesosphere Inc., SS-CFPB-16-026</p>
<p>The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), intends to contract with Mesosphere Inc., 88 Stevenson Street, San Francisco, CA 94105, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for a Data Center Operating System (DCOS) software license subscription. Mesosphere Inc. has been identified as the only source capable of providing the required content in an arrangement that suits the needs of the CFPB. <br />The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau requires a Mesosphere Data Center Operating System (DCOS), (Software License Subscription), providing CFPB a highly reliable computer environment for large server clusters.</p>
<p>Mesosphere is a software solution that expands upon the cluster management capabilities of Apache Mesos with additional components to provide a new and novel way to manage server infrastructures. Vague, but similar companies tend to be "platform as a service" (PaaS) type. PaaS services are limited in that they focus only on deploying applications that are Docker containers. CFPB's need is to have a clustered environment that supports Docker containers as well as other native applications. The Mesosphere DCOS is a datacenter-scale operating system that enables the running of services and applications across a cluster of machines within a datacenter or cloud. The DCOS combines the Apache Mesos cluster manager with a number of open source and proprietary components, allowing the deployment and management of services through a custom UI and CLI tooling. DCOS provides a highly elastic and highly scalable way of deploying applications, services, and big data infrastructure on shared resources. DCOS is capable of handling any size application, spanning tens of thousands of machines when needed and scaling across the entire cluster, effortlessly.</p>
<p>DCOS is part of an emerging area of server technology that provides a level of abstraction above individual hardware resources, for scaling clustered environments across a large number of servers. There is no other offering currently that provides both the range of capabilities, as well as support, reducing technical risk and meeting program goals.</p>
<p>The identified contractor, Mesosphere Inc. is currently the only source for the Data Center Operating System (DCOS), (Software License Subscription).</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by February 01, 2016 @ 2 pm ET.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. A request for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered an affirmation response to this Special Notice. Telephone responses or inquires to this Special Notice will NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted electronically to Purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov, Attn: TAshcroft, CGropp</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Responses must include sufficient evidence that clearly demonstrates the vendor is available and is capable of providing the required products/services. If no written response is received that clearly demonstrates an ability to meet all requirements, is more advantageous to the Government, and is received by the aforementioned deadline, Fiscal Service shall make award on a sole source basis to Mesosphere Inc.<br />Qualified contractors shall provide the following:<br />1. Company name and address, contact information, and business size (Large Business, Small Business, Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, HUBZone, etc.). Please ensure contact information includes the name of the point of contact, email address, and telephone number should the Government have questions regarding individual responses.<br />2. Whether your products/services are available through a Government contract vehicle or Open Market.<br />3. A brief capabilities statement (not to exceed 5 pages) that includes a description of your company's standard line of business, your proposed products/services, as well as a list of customers for which your company currently provides these products/services. <br />4. DUNS Number.<br />The following file extensions are not allowable and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered:<br />.bat, .cmd, .com, .exe, .pif, .rar, .scr, .vbs, .hta, .cpl, and .zip files.<br />Microsoft Office compatible documents are acceptable.<br />No other information regarding this Special Notice will be provided at this time.<br />This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. All firms responding to this notice are advised that their response is not a request that will be considered for contract award. All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), has a requirement to make improvements to the Active Seismic Imaging (ASI) System. The ERDC intends to issue an award to the University of Kansas Center for Research on a sole source basis. It has been determined that the Kansas Geological Survey, located at the University of Kansas Center for Research, is the only source capable of providing the required modifications to the Active Seismic Imaging (ASI) System. The original ASI system was designed and manufactured by the Kansas Geological Survey specifically for the ERDC, and the software and design specs are proprietary to the Kansas Geological Survey. No other source would have the ability to modify the current system with hardware ensuring compatibility with the current ASI system design. Additionally, as the software is proprietary to KGS, no other source would be able to make the required changes to include processing with the additional length and second streamer of sensors. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541712 (Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences except Biotechnology) with a size standard of 500 employees.
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals. A solicitation will not be issued. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The information submitted must be provided in sufficient detail to demonstrate the vendor's ability to fulfill this requirement. The contractor must also provide a description of their past experience in fulfilling requirements which are the same or similar to this requirement and references for each.</p>
<p>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses to this requirement may be submitted to Jody Criss at Jody.Criss@usace.army.mil. The solicitation number shall be included in the subject line of the e-mail submission. Responses must be received no later than 5 days from the posted date of this notice.</p>

<DESC>Intend to Award Sole Source to: Cepheid
THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Albany, Buffalo and Syracuse NY VA Medical Center intends to award a firm fixed price sole source contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), only one source to:

Cepheid
904 Caribbean Drive
Sunnyvale, CA  94089

The objective of this sole source award is for a Base + 4 Option Year Contract to acquire supplies for the VA Owned GeneXpert DNA Analyzer. Sole source is based on only one responsible source as Cepheid is the manufacturer of GeneXpert DNA Analyzer.  The reagents and test kits will be used in the Cepheid Genexpert equipment.  According to the manufacturer, there are not any substitutes for reagents that will work in equipment.  Additionally, the original equipment manufacturer states that it does not use third party companies as distributors and that it is the only source of these proprietary reagents.  The Veterans Health Administration prohibits the use of "gray market" items in its facilities.  Gray market items are those items outside of the original equipment manufacturer's intended distribution channels.

PLEXON INC - Video Recording System----NOT FOR USE ON HUMANS
RESEARCH PURPOSE ONLY
A highly specialized device that records the behavior of rodents and creates an activity map of the behavior pattern.  This device is capable of revealing brain activity, including areas of the brain that have suffered traumatic brain injury.  The various components and subcomponents work seamlessly to record behavior and then render a brain activity map.  The software is integrated with the device and analyzes the data to produce a map of the neural activity of the brain.  The amplified signals are then analyzed to determine states of consciousness and how different areas in the brain interact to produce purposeful behavior. 
The industry's most advanced approach to digital video recording, position tracking and behavioral analysis for freely moving and behaving animal experiments. The NEW CineCorder, CineTracker and CineLyzer Systems are designed for labs focused purely on behavior research and conducting many trials with several animals. The CinePlex System is for researchers integrating video and neural recordings within an experiment.
This is the only vendor that provides a turn-key integrated system that is capable of collecting and analyzing data from the moment of delivery. Because it is a turn-key integrated system, this device is being used by many research labs and serves as a reference standard.   Data collected with this system can be compared with data from other labs.
Other vendors provide subcomponents or their software requires extensive reprogramming to construct the brain activity maps.  This requires knowledge of computer programming, resulting in additional costs.

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Please contact the following for any concerns regarding the solicitation and/or award of this requirement: Jennifer Pacheco Contracting Officer MICC - Fort Riley Com: (785) 239-4586 Email: jennifer.l.pacheco19.civ@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.

However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Under the Health Facilities Engineering (HFE) program, IHS conducts projects to perform major maintenance, periodic repair of building components, and facility improvements. Design and construction contract administration work will typically be carried out in accordance with 2013 Version of the IHS A-E Design Guide.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.ihs.gov/des/includes/themes/newihstheme/display_objects/documents/AEDesignGuide2013.pdf</span></p>
<p>The resulting contract will be for a base period of three hundred and sixty five (365) calendar days with four (4) one (1) year options that may be unilaterally exercised by the Government.

There are several of these facilities throughout Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming with the highest concentration being in Washington, then Oregon. <br /><br />The resultant contract will be for a base period of three hundred and sixty five (365) calendar days with four (4) one (1) year options. IHS anticipates awarding only one contract to one firm.</p>
<p><strong>Services include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>
<p>a. <strong>Evaluations, Assessments, and Planning Services:</strong> facility condition assessments; site development feasibility studies; conceptual designs; cost estimating; space planning and space efficiency studies; energy modeling and investment-grade energy feasibilities studies; building systems evaluations; electrical studies including short-circuit coordination studies and evaluation of power quality problems; pre-design commissioning activities; environmental testing and environmental site assessments; geotechnical and soil investigation and testing; water quality analysis; legal survey work for real property transfers including metes and bounds surveys.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Design Services:</strong> development of design and construction documents (i.e. drawings, specifications) and associated engineering work in accordance with the Indian Health Service "Architect/Engineer (A/E) Design Guide" dated 2013. <br />c. Construction Contract Administration Support Services: participating in pre-construction conferences; responding to contractor requests for information (RFIs); reviewing construction submittals and shop drawings; performing inspections and field observation reports; advising the project officer regarding deficiencies and actions required or recommended; preparing supplementary drawings or revision drawings; managing document versions and revisions; reviewing contract modification proposals; reviewing contractor progress payments.</p>
<p>d. <strong>Post-Construction Contract Services:</strong> commissioning; preparing operation and maintenance manuals; preparing conformed-set drawings; preparing record drawings and as-built drawings; issuing certificates of completion (often required to be prepared and signed by a registered professional engineer); providing training on proper operation, maintenance of equipment, support for building automation, and systems troubleshooting (IHS provides support to tribal utility departments and may identify needs to provide training and troubleshooting of sanitation systems through this contract.) e. Integrate Sustainable Features: To the maximum extent possible these scope items shall integrate or include sustainability features that will reduce the energy usage, water usage, reduce emissions, divert solid waste, reduce consumption of toxic materials and chemicals, increase organic waste diversion, ensure retrofitting and renovation promotes building's long term viability, and other sustainable enhancements.</p>
<p>e. <strong>Integrate Sustainable Features:</strong> To the maximum extent possible these scope items shall integrate or include sustainability features that will reduce the energy usage, water usage, reduce emissions, divert solid waste, reduce consumption of toxic materials and chemicals, increase organic waste diversion, ensure retrofitting and renovation promotes building's long term viability, and other sustainable enhancements. <br /><br />It is estimated there will be 4-10 task orders during the first year with the most common cost magnitude per task order ranging from $25k-$100k. Although it is required that the A&amp;E be able to provide the full scope of required services, the (a) Evaluations, Assessments, and Planning Services and (b) Design Services will likely be utilized the most frequently.</p>
<p>All interested firms are required to submit five (5) copies of a recently completed Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, which are due to the Contracting Officer <strong>no later 1300 (1 P.M.) Pacific Time on 8 September 2015</strong>. Photocopies are acceptable. When completing your SF330, be sure to include information on the team you will be using for this contract, including key personnel of subs and consultants. A fillable-PDF version of the SF330 is an attachment to this Notice. A link to download this form is visible on the right-hand side of the webpage where you are viewing this Notice. A cover letter, on the Respondents stationary (provided it is of a paper color that can be copied or scanned and remain readable) or otherwise identified, may be submitted that is no more than two (2) pages in length. You may submit supplementary information that illustrates your firm's ability to meet the evaluation criteria listed below. A/E Design Services Technical Qualification Evaluation Criteria. Supplementary information shall not exceed five (5) 8.5"x11" pages.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> In formulating the Qualifications submission, potential respondents should consider that FAR 52.219-14, which will be incorporated into any resultant contract, requires the Prime Contractor to perform services under the contract equivalent to 50% or more of the contract value in personnel costs throughout the life of the contract. This is a positive requirement rather than one where an indication of capacity, capability or willingness to meet these requirements would be acceptable. Respondent(s) should demonstrate in their Qualifications submission how they will meet this requirement. Although the specific project effort awarded under any resultant contract is not known at this time, it is believed to be unlikely a Respondent could reasonably expect to meet this FAR requirement where they propose a Prime Contractor role limited to a single discipline, or possibly even multiple disciplines, where the discipline mix proposed leans towards disciplines typically not heavily utilized in A-E Services for Health Facilities Engineering projects.</p>
<p><strong>Address your submission as follows: </strong></p>
<p>SF330 - 15-102-SOL-00017<br />Attn: John Fannon (Contract Specialist) <br />IHS Division of Engineering Services - Seattle<br />701 5th Street<br />Suite 1600, Mail Stop RX-24<br />Seattle, WA 98104<br />john.fannon@ihs.gov</p>
<p>All Respondent(s) are advised that registration in the Systems for Award Management (SAM) database is required prior to award of a contract. Failure to register in the SAM database may render your firm ineligible for award. For more information, check the SAM Website at http://www.sam.gov. Completion of the electronic annual representations and certifications are also mandatory prior to the award of a contract.</p>
<p>IHS may complete a short list of or a final selection of A-E Respondent(s) based solely upon initial Respondent submissions without discussion.

Respondent(s) included on the developed short list may be required to attend a face-to- face interview with the Source Selection Board members. Appropriate Respondent(s) would be notified when and if the Interview Stage is added to the evaluation process.</p>

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 339112, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

This requirement is put forth as unrestricted. The VA Long Beach Healthcare Center seeks to issue a purchase order for various Cardiac Catheters and products.  Catheters are steerable thin flexible tubes containing multiple electrodes.  These catheters can provide information about the location of the electrical impulse conduction path (called electrophysiological mapping) responsible for heart muscle contraction.  The catheters also can transmit RF (radiofrequency) current through an electrode at the catheter tip for the purpose of ablation (destruction) of a small segment of heart muscle responsible for abnormal impulse conduction.  When used with the CARTO system and REF-STAR reference device, a real-time 3-dimentional image of the heart chamber can be made.  For ablation, the catheter can be used with a compatible commercially available RF generator and dispersive pad which carries energy from the patient's body back to the RF generator. These items will be used in invasive cardiac electrophysiology laboratories and other procedural suites in the Veterans Health Administration for invasive electrophysiology and arrhythmia ablation procedures.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p><br />The Government intends to make a single award but reserves the right to make no award as a result of this request for quotations.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award this contract based on initial quotations without holding discussions. Therefore, the initial quotation shall contain the offeror's best terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Award will be made, if at all, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the requirements of the solicitation is deemed the most highly rated and represents the best value to the Government considering the Government's evaluation of the following factors: (1) technical, (2) past performance/references, and (3) price.</p>
<p>Relative weight of the evaluation factors - Technical is more important than past performance. Technical and past performances, when combined together, are significantly more important than price. The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of equality among quotations of the non-price factors. In addressing the evaluation factors below, the offeror shall demonstrate:</p>
<p>TECHNICAL -</p>
<p>1 TECHNICAL APPROACH</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's ability to provide the required market basket as listed in the statement of work.</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE/REFERENCES -</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance information to determine its relevance to the current requirements and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. In assessing the offeror's past performance, NIH will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. The Government will assign a neutral rating to offerors with no relevant past performance.</p>
<p>PRICE -</p>
<p>The price evaluation will determine whether the proposed price is fair and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements. The proposed price shall be entirely compatible with the technical quotation.</p>
<p>Although price is the least important evaluation factor, it will not be ignored. The degree of importance of the proposed price will increase with the degree of equality of the quotations in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be based.</p>
<p>QUOTATIONS ARE TO BE SENT ELECTRONICALLY TO DEBORAH CULPEPPER BY THE DUE DATE AND TIME.</p>

<p><br />ix) 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items (Oct 2014)<br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items<br />(a) The USCG intends to evaluate quotations and award a single purchase order without discussions. Therefore, each initial quotation shall contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The USCG reserves the right to conduct discussions, if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. The USCG may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the public interest. Finally, the USCG may waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations.</p>
<p>The evaluation factors and sub-factors are listed in descending order of importance. Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than price. The degree of importance associated with price will increase commensurably with the degree of equality among different offerors' technical and past performance quotations.</p>
<p>(1) Technical Capability<br />(2) Past Performance<br />(3) Cost/Price</p>
<p>Technical: <br />Offerors shall provide a narrative that exhibits its knowledge, ability, and method of providing all the requirements in the SOW in regards to number of rooms, capacity, and equipment. <br />** A site visit will be conducted to determine technical acceptance <br />The Government shall evaluate the offeror's quote against these requirements to determine whether the proposal is acceptable or unacceptable, using the ratings and descriptions outlined in Table below.<br />Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable The offer clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable The offer does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Past Performance:<br />Per FAR 13.106-2(a)(3)(c), the USCG will primarily evaluate offeror's past performance by using the Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The USCG will examine an offeror's recent and relevant history of past performance to assess the degree of risk the offeror may present during order performance.<br />"Recent" means that per FAR 42.1503(g), USCG will evaluate past performance information in PPIRS that is within the previous three years of the anticipated start of the period of performance (i.e., 28 September 2012 to 28 September 2015).<br />"Relevant" means that USCG will evaluate recent past performance information that is similar in size, scope, and complexity to the present SOW.<br />Past performance shall be used as an evaluation factor within the LPTA process. Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings in Table below.<br />Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Price:<br />Offeror shall prepare their price quote utilizing the attached Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Offerors must provide complete pricing items to be procured in Attachment ___1_____<br />A zero dollar rate (tiny_mce_marker.00) or a rate left blank will be interpreted by USCG to mean that the offeror will provide the required service as not separately priced.</p>
<p>Technical and past performances, when combined, are more important than price. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair/overhaul services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair/overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-16-Q-010059 is assigned for tracking purposes only. Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 apply. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-85. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to a fully capable repair vendor.
<p>Any vendor, except the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or a Production Approval Holder (PAH), repairing Coast Guard Aircraft Components MUST be FAA 145 certified and perform at least fifty percent (50%) of the work at their own company's FAA certified facility. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, awards for the repair or overhaul of Coast Guard Aircraft Repairable Components shall only be awarded directly to service vendors who have been deemed fully capable of performing such services by division level command-appointed Coast Guard Engineers or Equipment Specialists.</p>
<p>Vendors who do not meet the above stated capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond to this solicitation/request for quote.</p>
<p>This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their repair data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV. If not previously deemed capable by ALC MRS, such vendors should forward any request for capability determination to Bryan.P.Bray@uscg.mil for future awards consideration. The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide service manuals or OEM service data. With their quote, vendors must provide a copy of the first page of the current OEM Manual or Service Reference, and in their quote make reference to it (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789"). Quote must include Date(s) and Place(s) of Delivery and FOB Point. The Component OEM is EMS Tech Canada and their Cage Code is 38743. The HC-144A Aircraft OEM is AIRBUS DEFENSE AND SPACE SAU EADS CASA, AV. DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B, and their domestic repair facility Cage Code is 0DAF1. Any TT&amp;E plus average repair cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical overhaul cost.

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a competitive basis as a result of this synopsis/solicitation.

&#61607;	Requirements - HSCG38-16-Q-200065 and
&#61607;	 Terms and Conditions  HSCG38-16-Q-200065. 

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  The Government shall ensure all procurements are awarded without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  



Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, or a certificate of conformance and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.

Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor.  Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.  

Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 35 calendar days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.27 per hour or $170.80 per week or $740.13 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; and 3 weeks after 10 years. Length of service includes the whole span of<br />continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and<br />with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same<br />Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as<br />screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,<br />and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,<br />modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive<br />ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading<br />and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;<br />minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All<br />operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE<br />Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444)</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming<br />procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract<br />work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage<br />and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage<br />rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the commencement date of<br />the contract (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(C)(vi)). When multiple wage determinations<br />are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to ensure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as<br />screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,<br />and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,<br />modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive<br />ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading<br />and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;<br />minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All<br />operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE<br />Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444)</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming<br />procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract<br />work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage<br />and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage<br />rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the commencement date of<br />the contract (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(C)(vi)). When multiple wage determinations<br />are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to ensure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.27 per hour or $170.80 per week or $740.13 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; and 3 weeks after 10 years. Length of service includes the whole span of<br />continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and<br />with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same<br />Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as<br />screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,<br />and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,<br />modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive<br />ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading<br />and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;<br />minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All<br />operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE<br />Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444)</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming<br />procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract<br />work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage<br />and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage<br />rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the commencement date of<br />the contract (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(C)(vi)). When multiple wage determinations<br />are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to ensure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.<br /><br /><br /><strong>2.0 Program Requirements<br /></strong><br /><strong>2.1 Program Description<br /></strong><br />The C-5 aircraft's primary mission is to provide strategic airlift in support of the United States Air Force's peace and war time missions. The C-5 users are represented by the Air Mobility Command (AMC), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). At this time there are no current or planned international operators of this weapons system. <br /><br />The Core Processing Modules (CPMs) within the existing Versatile Integrated Avionics (VIA) and Avionics Interface Unit (AIU) hardware will be replaced. There are two CPMs in each VIA and one in each AIU. The new CPM (referred to as CPM II) will provide additional throughput, additional memory and a new Ethernet interface. <br /><br />The weather radar modification involves removal of the existing APS-133 weather radar and the installation of a WXR-2100 radar system from Rockwell Collins, two Video Distribution Units (VDUs), and a new waveguide. The modification will replace the antenna, antenna pedestal, waveguide, receiver/transmitter and radar control panels. The current Bunk PA control panel is replaced with a combined Bunk PA/UHF Antenna select panel (the antenna select control was located on the legacy weather radar control panel). <br /><br />The VDU accepts one channel of digital video input from the weather radar and provides the capability to replicate the digital video signal to four independent outputs. Each of the four digital video outputs connects to a C-5M Multifunctional Display Unit (MFDU). Because there can be eight MFDUs on the C-5M aircraft, two VDUs are required per aircraft. The VDUs are located in Avionics Bay 3.<br /><br /><strong>2.2 Capability Required<br /><br /></strong>The contractor shall be responsible for:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Procuring, assembling, and delivering 50 CMC/Wx Radar modification kits<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.

Deliveries shall typically occur over 12 months with the exception of Lot 1 which will have a compressed delivery schedule.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lot 1: 7 kits delivered starting not later than 1 Sep 2017 and ending by 31 Mar 2018<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lot 2: 9 kits delivered starting not later than 1 Jun 2018<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lot 3: 15 kits delivered starting not later than 1 Jun 2019<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lot 4: 15 kits delivered starting not later than 1 Jun 2020<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lot 5: 4 kits delivered starting not later than 1 Jun 2021<br /><br /><strong>CMC/Wx Radar Notional Expedited Kit Delivery Schedule.</strong> Contract award is scheduled to occur by 29 Apr 2017. The Government requires modification kits to support the installation schedule. Deliveries shall occur by specific dates which the USG will establish in the RFP for each individual kit. The timeliness of each individual kit's delivery will be addressed in Contractor Performance Assessment Reports (CPARs). Deliveries shall typically occur over 12 months with the exception of Lot 1 which will have a compressed delivery schedule.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lot 1: 7 kits delivered starting not later than 1 Sep 2017 and ending by 31 Mar 2018<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lot 2: 15 kits delivered starting not later than 1 Jun 2018<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lot 3: 15 kits delivered starting not later than 1 Jun 2019<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lot 4: 13 kits delivered starting not later than 1 Jun 2020<br /><br /><strong>C-5M Weapon System Trainer Kit Delivery Schedule.</strong> Option for execution in either FY2019 or FY2020 for four (4) WST kits. <br /><br /><strong>C-5M Aircraft Maintenance System Trainer (AMST) Kit Delivery Schedule.</strong> Option for execution of one (1) AMST kit in FY2019&nbsp;and one (1) AMST kit in FY2020.<br /><br /><strong>C-5M Installation Schedule.</strong> Contract award is scheduled to occur by 29 Apr 2017. Lot 1 will require installation of the first aircraft begin in 4QFY2017, with the remaining six aircraft installations occurring before end of 2QFY2017. During 3QFY2017, contractor personnel will support transition to Organic Depot Installation with meetings and training.<br /><br /><strong>Procurement.</strong> Potential offerors are expected to enter into Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) with both the aircraft and component level Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM). The CMC/Wx Radar configuration, as designed and tested in the Engineering and Manufacturing&nbsp;Development (EMD) Phase of this program, is the baseline for the concurrent Communication Navigation Surveillance / Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) program. Offeror recommendations for changes to the CMC/Wx Radar configuration will not be considered. The current OEMs for the CMC/Wx Radar program are as follows:&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lockheed Martin Aero - Marietta, GA (Prime Original Equipment Manufacturer for Airframe)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honeywell - Albuquerque, NM (Core Mission Computer)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rockwell-Collins - Cedar Rapids, IA (Weather Radar)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ballard Technology - Everett, WA (Video Display Unit)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mega Industries - Gorham, ME (Waveguide)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FTG Aerospace - Chatsworth, CA (UHF/Antenna Select Bunk PA Panel)<br /><br /><em>Note:</em> the organic technical repair center for aircraft depot-level maintenance is Warner-Robins Air Logistics Complex (WR-ALC), Robins Air Force Base, Georgia.<br /><br /><strong>Kit Builds.</strong> Potential offerors are expected to build kits in accordance with Government-approved drawings. Formal technical data packages are not set for release until March 2017. The offeror should assume no parts (i.e. bench stock, work order residue, etc.) called out in the provisioning parts list are available at the installation site -- all items shall be provided as part of each individual kit. There are an estimated 375 pieces in the total provisioning parts list. One complete kit will be provided as a spare should any components of kits arrive at the Depot Installation Facility in unserviceable condition. It will be the contractor's responsibility to immediately replace any unserviceable or defective parts of the spare kit. The contractor will be responsible for performing First Article Testing/Inspection to verify component manufacturing and assembly quality, dimensional accuracy, workmanship, finish, and compliance with the Government TDP. <br /><br /><strong>Kit Deliveries.</strong> For planning purposes, the Government will accept CMC/Wx Radar kit delivery at WR-ALC, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. WST and AMST kit delivery locations will be provided in the RFP. The contractor shall be responsible for managing the deliveries of all kits. On time arrival of kits at the Depot Installation Facilities will be incentivized. <br /><br /><strong>Security Requirements.</strong> Contractors will be required to have a SECRET clearance to gain access to Government and contractor facilities. The effort described in this RFI will require access to export controlled data and software in accordance with the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751, et seq.) or the Export Administrative Act of 1979, as amended, (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.). The data and software will be provided in accordance with Department of Defense Directive 5230.25 enclosure 5. For prime and/or subcontractors under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) eligibility to participate in any solicitation associated with this effort will be dependent on the agency's determination that the contractor has adequate controls in place to ensure the proper protection of the export controlled data and software.<br /><br /><strong>Contract Specifications.</strong> The Government plans to use priced contract "options" by Lot year that best meet the needs of the Program measured in cost, schedule, and technical performance. Lot 1 kits are scheduled to be on contract as soon as Apr 2017.<br /><br /><strong>Warranties.</strong> Express or implied warranties provided through the vendor should begin once components are installed on the aircraft. <br /><br /><strong>2.3 Modification Description</strong><br /><br />The contractor will be required to fabricate, procure, and provide warehousing and kitting services for CMC/WxR aircraft Group A and Group B kit components required for aircraft modification. The CMC/WxR modification includes replacing and/or installing system line replaceable units, incorporating a software load port at an existing load panel, and adding cabling between the load port and the VIA/AIUs and WxR receiver/transmitter.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Region, has a requirement for spot surface preparation and painting of damaged surface areas on the interior of the Upper Nevada Laterals.  The work is located at Hoover Dam, on the Colorado River, approximately 7 miles northeast of Boulder City, Nevada, and 32 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, in Clark County, Nevada and Mohave County, Arizona.  This work is specifically on the Nevada side of Hoover Dam.

This work is not for full repair of the penstock coatings.  It is for limited repair of the areas of the interior portion that are damaged.  The principal components of repairing each penstock are anticipated to include the following: 

(1) Furnishing, erecting and relocation scaffolding system for the internal 13-foot diameter penstock laterals. The upper penstock 13-foot diameter laterals slope at an angle of 45 degrees.  Each lateral is nearly 275 feet long. (Laterals are simply the smaller pipes that branch off the 30-foot pipes to feed the hydro generators.); 

(2) Coating removal, surface preparation, and coating of damaged areas in the interior 13-foot diameter penstocks sections; and 

(3) Control of leakage water, estimated to be approximately 200-500 gallons per minute (GPM) within the penstock, may be necessary.  The water can be plumbed directly through the drains of the penstock, and from there, the Government will pump the water into the river.  Care must be taken to isolate this water from any work that may contaminate this water.

This solicitation is Unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 238320 Painting and Wall Covering Contractors, which has a small business size standard of $15M.  This acquisition will be pursued in accordance with FAR Part 15 and in accordance with the source selection evaluation criteria included in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Award will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price and non-price factors.  It is expected that the RFP will include evaluation factors for Relevant Experience, Technical Capability, Past Performance and Price.  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract as a result of this solicitation.  Award is expected by January 2016.  The estimated price range is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  

Offerors are required to have a current registration on the System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for contract award.  Offerors may register on SAM at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/

A pre-proposal site visit will be scheduled for all interested parties.  Site visit information (e.g. date, time, location) will be provided with the solicitation.

It is anticipated that the solicitation, in the form of an RFP, will be issued on or about November 19, 2015.  No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued. The solicitation will only be issued electronically via www.FBO.gov. Offerors should register on FBO to be included on the offeror list in order to receive notifications pertaining to the solicitation or visit the FBO website after issuance to download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.

<DESC>Develop Light Emitting Diode High Intensity Runway Edge Light Fixture with InfraRed


1.	Background:
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 will eventually phase out all incandescent lighting technology and as a result, incandescent technology will be replaced by light emitting diodes (LED) and other future lighting technologies.  In addition, industry use of LED lighting technology for airfield ground lighting has been growing exponentially since 2002 because of its higher energy efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and many other advantages over incandescent.

About 10 years ago, the FAA published a final rule permitting Enhanced Flight Vision System (EFVS) that detects Infra-red (IR), for operations to be conducted below DA/DH or MDA down to 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation.  In June 2013, the FAA published the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) for public comment on Revisions to Operational Requirements for the Use of Enhanced Flight Vision Systems (EFVS) and to Pilot Compartment View Requirements for Vision Systems or EFVS for short. This revision is to expand the EFVS operations below 100 ft to touchdown. The FAA is currently working on the final rule for publication in the Federal Register.

In 2008, the RTCA SC-213, Enhanced Flight Vision Systems and Synthetic Vision Systems (EFVS/SVS) committee took on the task to identify the IR amount needed for EFVS. After two years, they were unsuccessful in establishing the required amount of IR.
 
In 2010, the SAE G-20 Committee was formed and originally tasked by AFS-400 to address the possible adverse impact to EFVS operations by transitioning airport approach and surface lighting systems from incandescent to LEDs.  The EFVS manufacturers addressed concerns about their equipment not being able to see an image on a Heads Up Display (HUD) of the approach LED lights or LED lights on the runway environment, due to little to no heat (IR) in the needed wavelength from LEDs.  Because of these concerns, FAA Office of Airports issued the guidance in the AIP handbook restricting the use of AIP funds for certain LED lights including LED Obstruction Lights, LED Approach Lights, and LED High Intensity Runway Edge Lights.  But airport operators may still choose to use their own funds to procure LED lighting.
  
To this date, the SAE G20 has not been able to identify the IR amount needed for EFVS.  
The Office of Safety and Standards (AAS) has been working closely with AVS, AFS and ATO to address challenges on the introduction of LED lighting into the airport environment.  The narrowband spectral output of LEDs means these sources do not produce infrared (IR) energy (heat), which is a by-product of old incandescent technology.
   
Traditionally, the NAS doesnt have a requirement for airport lighting to emit IR energy.  Airport lighting standards are solely based on visual references (intensity, brightness, color, beam spread).  However, in an attempt to lift the AIP restriction from funding LED high intensity runway edge light (HIRL) fixture, FAA L-862(L), an effort to develop a HIRL fixture with the necessary IR output is needed.
Purpose:

Develop an FAA L-862(L) with IR output by:

1.	Identify requirements based on:
a.	Measure the legacy L-862 incandescent HIRL fixture IR output and IR beam pattern.
b.	Utilize the visual light requirements from FAA AC 150/5345-46 (current version), and FAA EB 67D.

2.	Conduct Feasibility Study to determine:
a.	If an L-862 (L) can be developed to incorporate the required IR.
b.	If a standalone IR only emitter can be developed to meet 1.a above.
3. Submission Deadlines

a.	Offerors shall propose to the FAA a validation plan.
b.	Offerors shall propose steps to develop a FAA L-862(L) LED with an IR emitter, to be designated as L-862(L-IR) and to ensure their compatibility with aircraft currently equipped with EFVS.
c.	Offerors shall propose steps to develop a standalone IR emitters and to ensure their compatibility with aircraft currently equipped with EFVS.

(2)	VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, and should address funding periods of performance.  Formal Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) and certified cost or pricing data may be required, depending upon the type of contract utilized. Upon completion of negotiations and agreement on contract price, a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data may be required.  Furthermore, any offeror who is required to submit and certify cost or pricing data shall submit accurate, current and complete cost or pricing data from his prospective subcontractors.  Offerors proposals may be subject to audit for cost realism.    
Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order:
	Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of the project. Cost should also be broken out for each task appearing in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see below); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing.  .  
	Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions (if any): This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? 
	 Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement. Present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made.
	 Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements.
 7. Method Of Evaluation 
Proposals will be evaluated in the four technical areas listed in order of decreasing importance:
a.	Technical merit.
b.	Utility to the FAA Airport Safety Research and Development (R & D) program.
c.	Team competency and experience.
d.	Effective plan for project completion.
Cost and cost realism will be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable only.  
8. Period of Performance: 
Proposals should not exceed $500K or longer than six months or they will be dismissed as non-responsive.

<CONTACT>Tammy A. Taylor, Phone 6174943462, Email tammy.taylor@dot.gov
<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) only. It is not a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued. This is an RFI for the purpose of conducting market research to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition. Submission of any information in response to this sources sought notice is COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.<br /><br />BACKGROUND: The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe) is currently performing an independent review for the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA's) Office of Policy regarding the process by which roadside safety hardware is deemed eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement. As a part of Volpe's evaluation, Volpe is requesting information from parties involved in the development, evaluation, and implementation of roadside safety hardware to obtain feedback and input related to their role(s) within the process. Volpe is currently looking at the development, evaluation, funding, implementation, and assessment processes with respect to roadside safety hardware. This evaluation involves examining the current Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility process for roadside safety hardware from the initial development of new or modified hardware through the installation and in-service evaluation phases. This review may result in improvement/change recommendations being made to FHWA or other organizations involved in the roadside hardware evaluation process.<br /><br />SCOPE: Volpe is seeking information on the processes by which roadside safety hardware is developed, evaluated, tested, implemented, and assessed.<br /><br />In Volpe's ongoing review of the roadside safety hardware evaluation process, Volpe has generally identified four phases of hardware development, evaluation, and implementation as follows:<br /><br />1. Development, evaluation and testing of new or modified roadside safety hardware;<br />2. Consideration of Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility;<br />3. Consideration of State acceptance; and,<br />4. Hardware installation and in-service assessments.<br /><br />Note that not every phase is required for each hardware development effort. For example, FHWA does not require a letter of Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility for a piece of hardware to be eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement.<br /><br />This RFI invites parties to submit comments related to any of these phases, including, but not limited to, the following:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Designing and/or modifying roadside safety hardware devices;<br />2.&nbsp; Development and implementation of roadside safety hardware testing criteria and procedures;<br />3.&nbsp; Testing and/or analysis of roadside safety hardware;<br />4.&nbsp; Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility determination process for roadside safety hardware;<br />5.&nbsp; State evaluation processes for roadside safety hardware;<br />6.&nbsp; Installation and maintenance of roadside safety hardware;<br />7.&nbsp; Inventory tracking of roadside safety hardware;<br />8.&nbsp; In-service performance evaluations of roadside safety hardware;<br />9.&nbsp; Sharing of relevant roadside safety data among stakeholders; and/or,<br />10.&nbsp; Recently-implemented changes to the roadside safety hardware evaluation process<br /><br />This RFI is intended to better inform Volpe as to the existing roadside safety hardware development and evaluation process, and to assist Volpe in identifying potential areas for improvement within the process.<br /><br />Interested parties&nbsp;should submit a capabilities package describing&nbsp;their process(es) that addresses the requirements&nbsp;of this RFI. Additionally, the Volpe Center is interested in a rough order of magnitude for each described process, as applicable. The preferred format for documentation is PDF. There is no page limit for responses to this RFI, however, it is requested only the&nbsp;pertinent information addressing the needs of this RFI be&nbsp;provided. Each response should reference this RFI's title, and provide the name and contact information (company, phone, email, etc.) of the submitter, at a minimum. Interested parties are requested to respond to this announcement in writing as soon as possible but not later than&nbsp;31 March&nbsp;2016. Telephone requests will not be honored. All responses should be sent via e-mail to tammy.taylor@dot.gov.<br /><br />The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive acquisition. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this notice and submittals will not be returned to the sender. For information about the Volpe Center, please refer to its&nbsp;website at http://www.volpe.dot.gov.<br />

<SUBJECT>Request for Expressions of Interest - Exchange Opportunity Dept of Labor Headquarters Building and Parcel, Washington DC
<SOLNBR>15DOLFPB
<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<RESPDATE>012616
<CONTACT>Sara Towner, Asset Manager, Email sara.towner@gsa.gov - Richard Sedwick, Asset Manager, Email richard.sedwick@gsa.gov
<DESC>Due to the closure of Federal offices in the Washington, DC, area based on weather conditions, GSA is extending the deadline for responses for solicitation 15DOLFPB.   Responses are due by 5:00 EST on the first business day the Government reopens.<br /><br />REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST<br />(REOI)<br />December 21, 2015<br />The General Services Administration (GSA) requests Expressions of Interest for a site to be used for the development of a new Department of Labor (DOL) Headquarters Building under a contemplated exchange. GSA is issuing this REOI as part of an exploratory process to determine if the United States Government will pursue the exchange of the existing Frances Perkins Building (FPB) and underlying land located at 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC in return for a new DOL Headquarters Building to be built by an exchange partner elsewhere within the District of Columbia (DC).  The exchange partner would be solicited in a subsequent two stage process: Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Request for Proposals (RFP). <br />This REOI is seeking to receive proposals for potential sites to accommodate the exchange for a new DOL Headquarters Building. As GSA explores the potential of an exchange transaction, GSA will consider (i) donated sites, (ii) sites to be sold to GSA through a no-cost, assignable purchase option (if exercised, allows for site acquisition at an agreed-upon price and is assignable to an exchange partner), or (iii) privately held sites on which the landowner wishes to retain exclusive development rights in the possible future exchange.  Donated sites are preferred.  Further description is provided below in the Developer Competition section. In addition to the sites submitted in response to this REOI, GSA will consider Federally-owned sites. <br />This site evaluation is being conducted pursuant to 40 U.S.C. &sect; 3304. GSA will review submitted sites against the minimum requirements set forth in this REOI and eliminate from further consideration those sites which do not meet, or are not readily capable of meeting, such requirements. GSA reserves the right to eliminate from consideration any remaining sites based on the additional criteria stated in this REOI, among others, and to select the site(s) (including sites other than those offered in response to this REOI) that GSA believes are the most advantageous to the Government, all factors considered, without regard to 41 U.S.C. &sect; 3101 et seq.
<p>MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: <br />Delineated Area: Washington, DC<br />Size: Capacity for office and related space, between approximately 850 thousand rentable square feet (RSF) and approximately 1.4 million RSF, plus parking as required by local code, and accommodating physical requirements of Interagency Security Committee (ISC) Level III Security, applicable zoning, and other restrictions imposed by law or regulation.   <br />Access to Transportation: The closest boundary line of the site offered shall be within 2,640 walkable linear feet from a Metrorail station entrance.<br />Utilities: Site must be capable of providing adequate public utilities, including but not limited to two distinct feeds of electrical power or a reasonable equivalent, to ensure continuity in operations.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL CRITERIA: <br />The Government will select the site(s), if any, which meet the minimum requirements set forth above and which are considered to be most advantageous to the United States for development of a new DOL Headquarters Building.  Additional criteria that the Government will consider are listed below. <br />Site Development Flexibility: Among those sites that meet the minimum requirements stated above, preference will be given to:<br />&bull;	Larger sites;<br />&bull;	Those providing greater development flexibility (site shape and topography); and<br />&bull;	Sites whereby the owner is willing to subdivide so that GSA only obtains the amount of land needed for the project.</p>
<p>Proximity to Hazards: Sites that are within close proximity to continuous or infrequent hazards will be evaluated less favorably, and, depending on the nature and severity of the hazard, may be eliminated from consideration. Hazards include but are not limited to: <br />&bull;	Facilities involved in hazardous material generation, handling, storage, processing or disposal; <br />&bull;	Facilities presenting dangers that cannot reasonably be mitigated, including:<br />&#9675;	Biological research facilities; <br />&#9675;	Bulk gas facilities; and<br />&#9675;	Pharmaceutical production and research facilities.<br />&bull;	Railroads.</p>
<p>Environmental Impacts: Sites on which the development of a new DOL Headquarters Building would significantly disturb natural resources (e.g. wetlands) or would otherwise have significant impacts on the quality of the human and natural environment in ways that could not reasonably be mitigated will be evaluated less favorably, and, depending on the nature and severity of the impact(s), may be eliminated from further consideration. <br />Floodplain: Sites that are not within a 100- and 500-year floodplain are preferred.<br />Zoning, Land Use, and Schedule: Sites on which the development of a new DOL Headquarters Building would be contrary to current zoning or local land use plans, and/or which would not now be capable of obtaining site development permits, will be evaluated less favorably. <br />Acquisition and Development Cost: Sites that, in the Government's estimation, provide opportunities to lower overall costs (acquisition and development) for the Government are preferred.  <br />Historic Resource Impacts:  Sites on which the development of a new DOL Headquarters Building would significantly disturb historic or archeological resources (e.g. buildings, grave sites, etc.) or otherwise have significant impacts on adjacent historic properties or resources that could not reasonably be mitigated will be evaluated less favorably, and, depending on the nature and severity of the impact(s), may be eliminated from further consideration.<br />In addition to these additional criteria, the Government may consider other attributes of a site. No one criterion listed above is considered to be more important than any other, as a general matter. However, in the context of its evaluation of an individual site, with each site having unique attributes, the Government may treat some criteria as being more important than others.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF SITE AVAILABILITY: <br />Site offerors should be prepared to make their sites available via assignable purchase option or donation option through April 2018; as well, the Government would possess extension rights for an additional six-month period. As noted above, the Government reserves the right to obtain purchase option or donation option rights to one or more (or none) of the offered sites.</p>
<p>FUTURE DEVELOPER COMPETITION INVOLVING SITE(S) SOLICITED BY REOI: <br />If GSA decides to move forward with an exchange transaction, GSA anticipates that successful REOI proposed sites, in addition to Federally-owned sites (if appropriate), will be identified and specified in a future RFQ and RFP for the development of a new DOL Headquarters Building.  Entities submitting sites for consideration in response to this REOI would, if identified, be required to enter into a site donation or assignable purchase option agreement with GSA (privately held sites on which the landowner wishes to retain exclusive development rights must respond to this REOI but would not be required to enter into a purchase option agreement).</p>
<p>Exchange Transaction: Once the exchange partner has completed construction of a new DOL Headquarters Building upon the selected site and the Government has accepted the new DOL Headquarters Building, GSA will convey title for FPB to the exchange partner via quitclaim deed.</p>
<p>GSA OBLIGATION: <br />GSA reserves the right, at its sole discretion, without any liability, to accept or reject any or all of the REOI responses. This REOI shall not be construed in any manner to create an obligation on the part of GSA to enter into any agreement, nor to implement any of the actions contemplated herein, nor to serve as the basis for any claim whatsoever for reimbursement of costs for efforts expended in preparing a response or participating in the selection process.</p>
<p><br />SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: <br />Expressions of Interest may be submitted by site owners or their agents. In the case of an agent, the EOI must be accompanied by documentary evidence of the agent's authority to make a site offer on behalf of the owner. <br />EOIs should be submitted in letter form. <br />EOIs must provide, at a minimum, site address or location, contact information and e-mail address of the Owner of the Site and Owner's Representative, and include an accurate description and sketch of the site offered. EOIs should also provide as much of the following documentation as is available: <br />&bull;	Proof of ownership and ability to transfer the site to the Government; <br />&bull;	Any available documentation which demonstrates that the site meets the minimum requirements set forth above and which addresses the Additional Criteria set forth above; <br />&bull;	Any available documentation which describes any site or off-site infrastructure required for development of the site; <br />&bull;	Any available documentation of any existing or currently planned site or off-site infrastructure that may benefit development of the site;<br />&bull;	Available surveys,  topographic maps, or other documents that identify, describe, or provide concise, salient detail related to the site, including legal descriptions, title reports, easements, encumbrances and environmental conditions;<br />&bull;	Information on underground storage tanks or utilities locations; or any zoning, public use or land use approvals secured; and<br />&bull;	Statement of the consideration, if any, required by the owner for the conveyance of the site.</p>
<p>EOIs must be received on or before January 26, 2016 by 5:00 pm (EST). Electronic submissions are acceptable to email addresses stated below. If providing hard copy responses, please submit three copies to: <br /><br />Sara Towner, Asset Manager<br />Richard Sedwick, Asset Manager <br />General Services Administration <br />301 7th Street SW<br />Room 7600<br />Washington, DC 20407 <br /><br />sara.towner@gsa.gov <br />richard.sedwick@gsa.gov</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE <br /><br />The U.S. Army Health Contracting Activity (Provisional)(USAHCA(P)), Health Readiness Contracting Office(Provisional) (HRCO(P)), Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) - Fort Sam Houston, Texas intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Firm Fixed Price Task Orders on a sole source basis to Mayo Clinic (dba College of Medicine), 200 1st Street SW, Rochester MN 55905. The requirement is for medical simulation training support services for the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) Medical Readiness Training Command (MRTC) and their supported units. MRTC is the USAR command tasked to provide pre-deployment readiness training to medical units throughout the USAR, the Active Army Component and DOD. The MRTC provides various levels of training to units throughout the Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) cycle and certifies medical units for readiness prior to deployment to a combat theater. The contractor shall provide MRTC and the units to be trained access to a simulation center and any associated classrooms, meeting rooms or storage areas located at the simulation center six times per year on the scheduled training dates, which will fall on four consecutive days beginning on a Friday and ending on Monday. The simulation center will provide medical training in emergency room, intensive care unit, endovascular care and similar clinical environments. The simulation areas shall include clinical equipment such as anesthesia machines, ventilators, defibrillators, perfusion simulator and high-fidelity computer directed manikins to provide high tech realism to the simulated medical events. The simulation center shall have the ability to simulate the flow of patients normally encountered in a deployed contingency operations environment which are flowing through the echelons of medical care from points of injury to initial damage control surgical capabilities (Forward Surgical Team) or to more definitive care facilities and capabilities of the Combat Support Hospital; that care will involve initial triage and management of multisystem trauma patients with injuries observed in a combat situation (massive blast injuries to include multiple limb amputations) as well as patients of varying degree of acuity to fully task and train the entire health care team, and that the training simulates a combat situation to stress the teams and to provide them an atmosphere to focus on improving team work and communication using the Team STEPPs framework. Team STEPPS is an evidence-based set of teamwork tools, aimed at optimizing patient outcomes by improving communication and teamwork skills among health care professionals. It was created jointly by the Department of Defense and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; it is now a mandatory training requirement for all deploying Army medical units. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611310. The HRCO (P) intends to award a contract no later than February 4, 2016. It is anticipated that the IDIQ contract will have a base ordering period of February 5, 2016 through February 4, 2017 and two 12-month option periods through February 4, 2019. The contract will also include FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. The HRCO(P) intends to solicit and negotiate only with Mayo Clinic under the authority of 41 United States Code 1901 as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.501(a)(1)(ii), sole source (including brand name) under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A solicitation will not be published. However, any quotes, proposals, or capability statements received by 12:00 PM CDT on January 29, 2016, will be considered by the contracting officer. The HRCO (P) reserves the right to amend this notice if needed. The Contracting Officer is Ms. Yesenia C. Rodriguez, (210) 221-4179, email: yesenia.c.rodriguez2.civ@mail.mil. The Contract Specialist is Mrs. Dawn E. Simington, (210) 221-3154, email: dawn.e.simington.civ@mail.mil

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service Southern Region has awarded two (2) Multiple Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts to support our pine and wiregrass seedling growing efforts throughout the region. The Southern Region includes the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Each task order will identify the specific location and details of the requirement. These IDIQ awards are intended to include a base and four option year periods. The work to be performed shall consist of the contractor furnishing all labor, materials, seedling trays, equipment, tools, transportation, supervision, facilities, and supplies (other than the government-furnished items such as seedlings). These contract awards are not to exceed $1,000,000. Basis for award was best value. When determining best value, past performance followed by technical capability and experience is more important than price. Past performance, technical capability and experience when combined are more important than price. If all options are exercised the contract shall expire 12/31/2020.

Wireless service is considered a supply IAW "supply" versus a "service." Airtime does not meet the definition of services, as defined in AFARS 5137.590-3, which states: "Service means the engagement of the time and effort of a contractor whose primary purpose is to perform an identifiable task, or tasks, rather than to furnish an end item of supply."</p>

<DESC>This is an Amendment to the class justification and approval (J&amp;A) for brand name specifications for commercial information technology (IT) maintenance for hardware and software and continued or supplementary licensing for FRTIB-owned software products, justified on a class basis following the framework of FAR 6.303 for open market procurements, FAR 8.405-6(b) for procurements under GSA Schedules, FAR 16.505(b)(2) for Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts, and FAR 13.106-1 for acquisitions less than the simplified acquisition threshold. Only commercial maintenance for hardware and software, data subscriptions, and licensing for hardware and software that is part of the FRTIB's enterprise architecture framework are included in this class justification. Commercial maintenance services may include replacement of existing hardware only if so specified in the maintenance contract. All licenses and maintenance for hardware and software approved under this class J&amp;A are commercial products previously procured and installed within FRTIB's architecture. The FRTIB requires ongoing maintenance and licensing renewals for these installed products. This document provides for brand name maintenance for IT hardware and software or licensing renewals to maintain infrastructure integrity as identified in the FRTIB's IT Technical Plan. This class J&amp;A does not cover hardware or software created specifically for FRTIB use, onsite support services, or help desk support.
