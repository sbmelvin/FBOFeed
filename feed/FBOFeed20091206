<DESC>The Bagram Regional Contracting Center intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to Supreme Site Services for the procurement of flight hours for rotary wing cargo transport service. This procurement is being made in accordance with FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency. Rotary Wing support under the current contract with Supreme Site Services expires on 15 December 2009. Plans to conduct a follow-on source selection were stymied by the publication of Department of Defense Instruction 4500.53 (DoDI 4500.53), dated 20 October 2008, which prohibits the use of non-DoD-approved air carriers or non-FAA certified aircraft in U.S. Government contract air operations without the approval of USTRANSCOM and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology &amp; Logistics (USD AT&amp;L). The Mi-8 series helicopter is not FAA certified. The follow-on contract must either utilize FAA-certified aircraft or military rotary wing assets. At this time, neither one of those options is viable. Therefore, we requested and obtained a 1-year waiver of the requirements of DoDI 4500.53 and are planning the bridge contract until the DoD can carry out the mission indefinitely. USTRANSCOM has indicated it will take approximately 9 months to procure and mobilize military rotary wing assets for this mission. This bridge contract will ensure continuity of this critical mission, while enabling the U.S. Government to put organic assets in place.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Mission Support Division, Norfolk, VA is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Western Branch Diesel, Inc. for the following requirement: Provide inspection report of "As Found" condition with recommended repair on the SSDG #1 Engine on the NOAA Ship Thomas Jefferson. The period of performance shall be December 15, 2009 through January 31, 2010. Work is to be preformed at 438 West York Street, Norfolk, VA 23510. The statutory authority is 41 US 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. Extensive repairs were accomplished on the engine within the past year by Western Branch Diesel. A portion of the required repairs is covered under existing warranty on the engine. No other entity can provide the necessary warranty repairs required. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). The applicable NAICS code is 333618. Interested parties may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses shall be submitted by 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, December 14, 2009. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov. <br />
<p>Sole Source Justification</p>
<p>The NOAA Ship Thomas Jefferson's SSDG #1 engine suffered failure of the charge cooler. This failure allowed seawater to enter several cylinders. There is historical data pointing to problems with earlier versions of the charge air cooler that were corrected under warranty by Western Branch Diesel, Inc. Furthermore, extensive repairs were accomplished on the engine within the past year. A portion of the upcoming repairs would be covered under existing warranty on the engine. The identified contractor has extensive history related to the performance and previous repairs on the subject engine. The Commanding Officer of the ship has issues CASREP TJ09-47 for the failure of this engine. Based on the above it is determined in the best interest of the Government to deal with the identified contractor to troubleshoot and accomplish the required repairs.</p>
