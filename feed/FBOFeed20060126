<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory,  Manufacturing Technology Division of the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, (AFRL/MLM ) solicits research proposals for  the Affordable Weapons' Datalink Insertion (AWDI) Program.  The objective of this program is to develop, demonstrate and implement advanced Manufacturing processes and practices that demonstrably reduce cost and mfg. cycle times associated with the transition of emerging weapon data link systems into Air Force munitions SDD/LRIP/FRP programs.   Focus will be toward the pursuit of aggressive product and process technologies that can dramatically reduce WDL fly away costs from their current baseline to below $5000/unit by FY10.  The primary transition target for this effort is Small Diameter Bomb Increment II (SDB-II).  However, solution applicability to multiple systems is a premium and interim transition onto other PGM systems (i.e. JASSM) prior to FY10 is also highly desirable.  A successful program will result in commitment to fully implement the developed processes and practices as well as a transition plan with SPO buy-in to incorporate the improved WDL product and processes onto their respective system.   .

<DESC>The Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) is a field activity of the Department of Defense and is comprised of several Directorates providing support to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  In the past, each Directorate has been responsible for its own Information Technology (IT) support and has done so through separate contracts each supporting a single Directorate.  In June 2004, a new WHS organization was formed, the Information Technology Management Directorate (ITMD). ITMD is charged with providing all IT support to WHS in a consolidated enterprise approach.  ITMD is responsible for delivering an efficient, performance-based IT environment with a prime support contractor who is fully accountable for integrating and delivering world-class services and performance.  ITMD is currently planning a competitive acquisition to select a prime contractor to provide this support.
ITMD released a Request for Information (RFI) to industry on October 19, 2005, and received inputs from interested offerors on November 16, 2005.  The RFI provided, in part, the following draft documents:  Statement of Objectives; Service Level Objectives; Work Breakdown Structure; and several documents describing the WHS IT environment.   These documents have now been updated and are attachments to this presolicitation notice. 
Based on the information collected in market research and upon further analysis by the Government acquisition team, WHS has determined that the forthcoming competitive acquisition will be for a single, winner-take-all contract with the winning prime contractor providing WHS information technology support under one consolidated effort.  Further, the Government currently anticipates conducting this acquisition as a small business set-aside under the procedures of FAR Subpart 19.5.    
Under the authority of FAR 15.202, Advisory Multi-Step Process, interested small business prime contractors (NAICS 51/54) are invited to submit information that will allow the Government an opportunity to advise them about their potential to be a viable competitor in the upcoming competitive acquisition.  To this end, small businesses are encouraged to form teaming arrangements, joint ventures or subcontracting agreements if necessary to increase their capability and viability to provide the required level of support.

A separate document will be posted to FBO providing interested offerors information necessary to respond to this Pre-solicitation Notice.

<DESC>As mandated by Public Law 89-522 dated July 30, 1966, the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH) provides reading materials in recorded and braille formats to U.S. residents and U.S. citizens living abroad who are unable to use conventional print materials because of visual and physical limitations.  Reading materials (books and magazines) are produced by contractors for NLS/BPH, and are distributed to a readership in excess of 759,000 through a network of 138 regional and sub-regional libraries for blind and physically handicapped individuals. States, municipalities, or other agencies operate these libraries.  In addition, books are distributed to schools, multi-state centers, and veterans' hospitals, all serving the blind.  Each year, more than 23 million books and magazines are circulated to these groups.  All services and products are funded by the U.S. Congress through NLS/BPH and are provided to patrons free, including mailing to and from patrons, through the U.S. Postal Service.  Currently, the Library of Congress is soliciting Bids, through this Invitation for Bids (IFB) for a contractor(s) to duplicate, package and distribute recorded cassette books in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (Section C) and the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH) specifications 202, 203, 300, 403, 701, 703, 1202 also attached.  Contract award will be expressed in titles and an extended price calculated by applying bid unit prices to quantities (cassettes) based on the "average title".  Total cost will be the controlling factor because actual number of titles assigned will depend on length of books selected and number of copies required. For additional information contact Chelsea Baker at 202-707-9129.

CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government!  .  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each sup plier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01   ADDITIONAL  EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class (es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classificat!  ion for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or !  revised performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications a re summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment!  , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the services of a contractor to conduct a California Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Auto-Immune (CA HIV/AI) demonstration that will test the extent to which providing a flexible health plan and employment support services to disability beneficiaries has an impact on the beneficiary’s ability to return to work.  The purpose of the health plan is to provide immediate access to healthcare services and resources required for a successful return to work. Demonstration project participants will also receive comprehensive employment support service coordination from the California Department of Rehabilitation (DOR).  The contractor will also establish an Expert Medical Unit (EMU) comprised of medical and other specialists with expertise in the areas of HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), immune and/or auto-immune disorders.  The EMU will provide case consultation services to DOR regarding the unique medical, psychosocial, and employment support needs of the target population.

Specifically, contractor services required include (1) refining the final plan of the demonstration and evaluation; (2) conducting the demonstration in the California counties of Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Alameda; (3) recruiting current disability beneficiaries with a diagnosis of HIV/AIDS, auto-immune and/or immune disorder to participate and dividing participants into a treatment group and a control group; (4) establishing an Expert Medical Unit (EMU) to provide consultation services to the contractor and DOR; (5) working with the EMU and SSA’s Health Benefits Package Contractor to identify an appropriate health plan for treatment group participants; (6) working with the California Department of Rehabilitation (DOR) to ensure treatment group participants receive appropriate employment supports and service coordination; and (7) performing a detailed evaluation of the demonstration and an analysis of its outcomes that will allow SSA to determine whether such services might produce positive work results for beneficiaries while providing long-term financial savings for SSA.

SSA anticipates awarding a cost-plus-fixed-fee type contract with an approximate 5-year period of performance.  The acquisition will be conducted using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541720 with a size standard of $6.5 million.  Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of any contract.  This is an unrestricted requirement and proposals from all responsible sources will be considered by the Agency.  The estimated date for issuance of the Request for Proposal (RFP) is on or about February 10, 2006 with proposal responses due 30 calendar days after date of issuance unless otherwise extended.  The solicitation and any amendments (and any related documents) will be available via the Government-wide point of entry (GPE) located at www.fedbizopps.gov for all interested parties.  Requests for hard copies will not be honored. Potential offerors shall be responsible for monitoring the GPE internet site for release of the solicitation, amendments (if any), and responses to any questions submitted in accordance with the solicitation provisions.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a 5-year, sole-source contract with the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD) located in Silver Spring, Maryland, for the purpose of designing, implementing, and evaluating the use of Pediatric Medical Units (PMU).  This contract is a continuation of the Children’s Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Project conducted by AUCD in conjunction with the University Centers For Excellence In Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD) and the Leadership Education in Neuro-developmental Disabilities (LEND) programs.  The PMU teams will consist of experts in a wide range of pediatric specialties. The PMUs will assist State Disability Determination Services (DDS) in identifying and obtaining appropriate and sufficient medical documentation to allow the disability examiners to make decisions as early in the disability adjudication process as possible. These PMUs will support the DDS by providing additional information and consultation on the childhood cases the DDS deems the most difficult to adjudicate. This contract will support two major goals of the Agency: 1) the development and evaluation of PMUs and 2) the study of a potential expedited benefit process for children with certain disabilities determined to meet the current definition of disability.  Both projects will further the Agency’s plan for improving the disability determination process. See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

[To request a copy of this Request for Proposal (RFP), please contact Ms. Jennifer Thomas, 301-228-4004, thomasj@ncifcrf.gov.]

The National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB) is seeking professional service expert(s) to work independently as well as directly with the NCICB project teams on the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG).  These experts must have had previous experience in: grid computing, n-tier architecture design developing highly interactive end user applications; software and data model design; and robust software development methodology that optimizes for high quality deliverables.  The contractor will include test plan development, software quality assurance procedures, and professional project management activities in its planning and execution. 

The goal of this project will be to demonstrate the usefulness of caGrid infrastructure as a platform to perform scientifically challenging investigations involving integration of data and analytical services from diverse research communities.  The caGrid client will enable individual users to work on common platforms to access caGrid resources in real time from common data and analytical services. The client will have various configurations that support end users in the cancer biomedical research community.

This application will ensure that all can access caGrid and serve as a platform for further development and innovation in the caBIG community.

Background:

The cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid, or caBIG, is a voluntary network or grid connecting individuals and institutions to enable the sharing of data and tools, creating a World Wide Web of cancer research (https://cabig.nci.nih.gov). The goal is to speed the delivery of innovative approaches for the prevention and treatment of cancer. The approach is to leverage existing technologies for the standardization of data representation and semantics coupled with common data integration architecture. 

As part of this effort, NCICB has developed and deployed a prototype grid caGrid  (https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/workspaces/Architecture/caGrid/) that enables the building of an open, multi-institutional data sharing, annotation, and analysis environment. 

caBIG “Silver” compliant systems (https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/guidelines_documentation) can become “grid enabled” by registering and plugging onto the caGrid infrastructure. When the system is generated using the caCORE SDK (http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/SDK), no additional code is required to expose the data service on the grid. 

caGrid has service registry that supports advertisement and discovery of services based on common metadata. The services registered on the caGrid can be queried using a caBIG XML Query Language. Invocation of analytical service deployed on the grid is also available on the caGrid.  caGrid specifies common interfaces and syntax requirements for registering and using grid services securely. It has tools to allow easy installation and deployment of Globus (http://www.globus.org/toolkit/), Open Grid Services Architecture-Data Access and Integration (OGSA-DAI), and Mobius Global Model Exchange services (http://projectmobius.osu.edu/overview.php). There is a web based user interface and thick client interface provided as part of caGrid to demonstrate the client APIs for accessing the grid services (http://cagrid-browser.nci.nih.gov/cagrid-browser/). caGrid leverages caCORE to provide the necessary semantic typing, modeling and metadata structures that define and constrain the contents of services in caGrid. 

The caGrid client demonstration project will leverage the caGrid infrastructure to support key caBIG program needs.

To request a copy of this Request for Proposal (RFP), please contact Ms. Jennifer Thomas, 301-228-4004, thomasj@ncifcrf.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled COMMENTS FOR THE SPACE TELECOMMUNICATIONS RADIO SYSTEM OPEN ARCHITECTURE DESCRIPTION which was posted on January 17, 2006. THIS MODIFICATION NO. 1 REVISES THE JANUARY 17, 2006 SYNOPSIS IN ITS ENTIRETY.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). NASA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this information, but may release an RFP at a later date based on the need for this type of technology and its feasibility based upon the responses to this request for information (RFI). This request is for information planning purposes and to allow industry an opportunity to provide information and comments on a proposed radio architecture and related technologies for space based radios.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit comments or questions to the identified point of contact, no later than March 15, 2006.  In responding, use reference RFI-NNC0600000L. Description The National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) is developing an open architecture description for software defined radios (SDR).  The Space Telecommunciations Radio System (STRS) SDR architecture provides architecture level specifications for hardware and software development to abstract the software waveforms from hardware platforms.  The architecture strives to support existing (e.g. legacy) communications needs and capabilities while providing a path to more capable, advanced network connectivity that promotes scalable, modular, reconfigurable, and upgradeable functionality and features. The NASA Software Defined Radio Architecture Team (SAT), comprised of HQ and multi-Center personnel, is responsible for the development of the architecture definition.  The recommendations from the SAT will be given to NASA’s Space Communication Architecture Working Group (SCAWG) for consideration as a radio standard for NASA’s future communication architecture.  The purpose of this request for information is to solicit comments that will be relevant to planning NASA’s future Space Communications Radio Architecture.  The information being sought includes comments on the preliminary draft of the architecture definition and the industry’s estimate for the impact, in cost, schedule and risk, of complying with the specification during the design, development, and verification of the space radio.  Comments are being sought from those developing and/or integrating radios for NASA, DoD, and commercial space applications. The SAT is requesting a written report and a summary presentation from the responder. Criteria for Summary Presentations: Companies requesting a briefing opportunity with NASA must provide, a brief description of their related technology and experience with flight radio developments for space or software systems development directly relative to the information sought, demonstrated to a maturity level acceptable for infusion into the architecture for space flight. Companies without a history in space flight technology development or products related to software defined radios applicable to space flight are welcome to provide written responses at this time and may receive an invitation to brief at a future date. Summary Presentations: Summary presentations shall be technical in nature, concise, and address the following sections. Technical accomplishments shall be clear with associated TRL. Additional material may be provided in the written responses. Generic company overview and marketing material is not necessary in the technical briefings.  Please follow the suggested outline below to the extent possible:     1.Overview of NASA considering an open, standard architecture        for radio communications (both space and ground-based).     2.Description of the responding organization’s programmable       and/or reconfigurable radios and their associated hardware        and software architectures.  Provide descriptions of        hardware and software module interfaces, module functions,        chassis designs and current state of development.      3.Describe any architecture practices that are similar to or         could apply to the STRS Architecture.  Describe solutions         to hardware and software interfaces to include in the STRS         standard.  Note willingness to release API’s or standard         hardware interfaces that may be used or become standard         for NASA radios.      4.Provide overview of responding organization’s comments on         the STRS Architecture Description. Provide view regarding         essential features and content of an open SDR architecture         standard for space use.	      5.Provide quantitative examples and statistics or metrics         when using common architectures across product lines or         with radios compliant with JTSR SCA.  Show life cycle         benefit.      6.Describe approach to a reusable hardware and software         library that could provide building blocks for multiple         radio configurations.  Describe the library module         functional and interface definitions used in company         developments.      7.Discuss significant technical challenges or issues         associate with a open, common architecture development for         NASA. The summary presentation is expected to occur in the Reston, Virginia area, tentatively planned for February 14th and if needed, the morning of February 15th, 2006.  Up to 1 or 1.5 hours (depending on number of companies presenting) will be available to each company to individually brief the SAT.	The audience for the presentation will include members of the SAT and possibly the Space Communication Architecture Working Group (SCAWG).  The company’s history in responding to other applicable NASA solicitations, such as the Request for Information for the SCAWG, could be summarized in the presentation, but the details of the material do not have to be repeated.

TITLE: ADVANCED COMPUTING ARCHITECTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS

ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:  Initial announcement.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA # 04-03 -IFKA

CFDA Number: 12.800 

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 04 should be submitted by 1 July 04; FY 05 by 1 May 05; FY 06 by 1 May 06; FY 07 by 1 May 07; and, FY 08 by 1 May 08. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 6 Jan 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

The intent of seeking advanced computing architectures is to explore computer architectures with greater capacity and sophistication for addressing dynamic mission objectives under constraints imposed by C2, ISR, and strike systems in order to establish, maintain, and exploit information superiority.  Evolution in computing performance, capacity, and adaptability will lead to extraordinary advances in warfighter capabilities and the systems they depend upon each day.  By broadening and increasing the cognitive capabilities of the computing infrastructure the advantages the warfighter has in filtering, detecting, tracking, fusion, and situational assessment can be unmatched.  Achieving, demonstrating, and fielding these cognitive advances in a constructive methodical manor is key to providing the information superiority necessary for future DoD mission success.
The overall objective of this BAA is to develop, integrate, and demonstrate advanced computing architecture technologies and applications. This effort will investigate the research, application and/or development of emerging advanced computing architecture technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas: (1) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the processing capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems. This area encompasses all information processing technology both hardware and software that could potentially contribute to enhancing the functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, scalability and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I processing systems. Examples of hardware technologies include data intensive processing architectures, power aware processing architectures, polymorphic processing architectures, high productivity computing systems, clockless logic, grid computing, data storage, data visualization, data busses, mobile and wireless networks. Examples of software technologies include programming languages both new and existing, data retrieval/mining, data management, data delivery, software/system monitors, publish/subscribe mechanisms, decision making techniques, distributed databases, and resource management. (2) Development of novel computing architectures that facilitate evolutionary computing (EC) methods such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Genetic Programming (GP), etc. for solving hard, NP-complete optimization problems.  Research in this area could address design tools for mapping algorithms and fitness function evaluation engines onto hardware/software systems, achieving extreme solution speeds, problem size scaling, physical miniaturization and power minimization of the physical platform.  Also of interest would be research aimed at employing EC methods to enhance and optimize the design process for composing such hardware/software systems, and applications of these technologies to specific optimization problems of interest to the Information Directorate. (3) Development of technologies supporting utilization of hybrid computation systems such as quantum or biomolecular computing combined with conventional CMOS Silicon systems. New algorithms and architectures, for interfaces between conventional electronic systems and systems based on new operations paradigms, are needed to transduce information in the most efficient manner.  This will enable development of hybrid systems with unique capabilities beyond general computing, such as intrinsic contextual addressing and computing. (4) Modeling and Simulation. Development of virtual real time modeling and simulation methods to enable more human intuitive design processes. Research in this area would focus on demonstrating extreme speed-ups of modeling and simulation engines used in present or proposed design environments, in order to achieve near real time inspection of the effect of changes made to a device or information system design.  This research area would also encompass fast methods to cast models and simulation engines into parallel and embedded processing platforms. In addition this area includes the development of simulation technology to perform rapid assessment and course of action analysis of the predictive battlespace environment. Examples of these particular technologies include: real-time simulation systems, advanced simulation architectures, M&S for wargaming, behavior representation, predictive assessment of adversarial actions, adversary intent inferencing, and application of these, or other, technologies to the concepts of dynamic planning/execution, and real-time decision support. (5) Development of hardware and software processing architectures and techniques to enhance mechanisms of intelligence leading to cognizant computing.  Examples might be learning algorithms, knowledge creation techniques, storage or computation media physically addressed by a context mechanism such as resonance or stochastic summation, or distributed processing where each of many parallel sensing devices, has its own processor that does significant data interpretation/reduction. (6) Development of information technology leading to the advancement or demonstration of autonomous systems for enabling improved situational awareness, situational management, and situational control of the battlespace. This area includes all information technology that could potentially contribute to enhancing awareness and response through processing, reconfigurability, networking, communication, teaming, and control of ground, air, and/or space platforms.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED:  Contractor shall furnish all labor, material, equipment, supervision, transportation and management necessary to perform Maintenance Resource Management Training in accordance with the performance work statement.  Services under this contract are required to be performed at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.

Evaluation for award will be Performance-Price Trade-off (PPTO).  Issuance of the solicitation will be on or about 15 February 2006 and will close on or about 16 March 2006.  The solicitation will be available over the Internet only; NO HARD COPIES will be sent.  Follow the links on the EPS website to access the solicitation:  USAF Offices, Air Mobility Command Locations, and 436 CONS, Dover AFB, DE.     Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires that any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contracts shall be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided via the website.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.  As of January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or to list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is designed to help you gather information you need for the resultant clauses/provisions.  The information you provide in your questionnaire is automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  The questionnaire is not your official ORCA submission; the information reflected in your provisions is the version Contracting will review.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; you then acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.  The POC for this acquisition is Lani L. Lowe (302) 677-5028, Fax (302) 677-2309, email: lani.lowe@dover.af.mil.

<DESC>THIS SOURCE SOUGHT NOTICE IS HEREBY AMENDED TO EXTEND THE DUE DATE FOR CAPABILITIES STATEMENT UNTIL FEBRUARY 24, 2006.


Project Title:  National Coordinating Center for the Demonstration Program for the Development and Establishment of Systemic Mechanics for the Prevention and Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting a Sources Sought/Market Survey to locate organizations to serve as the National Coordinating Center for the “Demonstration Program for the Development and Establishment of Systemic Mechanisms for the Prevention and Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease” (National Coordinating Center) for the Genetic Services Branch, Division of Services for Children with Special Health Needs, Maternal and Child Health Bureau of HRSA.  These services fall under NAICS Code 541720 ($6M).    HRSA encourages Historically Black Universities and Colleges to participate in this Sources Sought. 

In 2004, Congress enacted and the President signed into law P.L. 103-357.  Section 712 of P.L. 103-357 authorized the Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) Treatment Demonstration Program.  Its purpose is to develop and establish systemic mechanisms to enhance the prevention and treatment of sickle cell disease. 

HRSA will carry out the legislation through the support of a National Coordinating Center and Regional SCD Treatment Demonstration Collaboratives (Regional Collaboratives).  Each Regional Collaborative will support the work of five to 10 individual community-based treatment demonstration programs.  The community-based programs will facilitate the delivery of education, health promotion, patient and family support, state-of-the-art treatment, and continuous, coordinated care to individuals with SCD.  These programs also will develop collaborative agreements with: (a) a community-based SCD organization or nonprofit entity that works with individuals with SCD; (b) the SCD newborn screening program for the State in which it is located; (c) the Title V Maternal and Child Health program for the State; (d) the HRSA Regional Genetic and Newborn Screening Collaborative in its area; and (e) other partners.

The scope of work requires the National Coordinating Center to (i) collect, coordinate, monitor, and distribute data, best practices, and findings regarding the activities of the Regional Collaborative; (ii) develop a model protocol for eligible entities with respect to the prevention and treatment of SCD; (iii) develop educational materials regarding the prevention and treatment of SCD; and (iv) prepare and submit to Congress a final report that includes recommendations regarding the effectiveness of the Regional Collaborative and such direct outcome measures as--(I) the number and type of health care resources utilized (such as emergency room visits, hospital visits, length of stay, and physician visits for individuals with SCD; and (II) the number of individuals that were tested and subsequently received genetic counseling for the sickle cell trait.

The development and establishment of systemic mechanisms to improve the prevention and treatment of SCD requires extensive knowledge and expertise in the system of care that serves people with SCD and the SCD Community as a whole. This includes extensive knowledge and expertise in genetic counseling and testing; bundling of technical services related to the prevention and treatment of SCD; training of health professionals; treatment (including SCD treatment centers); continuity of care programs; consumer education; community-based SCD organizations or nonprofit entities that work with individuals who have SCD; SCD newborn screening programs and the maternal and child health programs under Title V of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) The contractor must also demonstrate familiarity with Federally-qualified health centers, reimbursement under the Medicaid program, State children’s health insurance program, and other health programs for the prevention and treatment of SCD.
 
Potential sources/interested parties shall provide relevant information which specifically demonstrates the capabilities to perform the following:  

•	Interacting, networking and working with diverse organizations (to include specialty care treatment centers, community-based health organizations, training programs, public health, consumer organizations, newborn screening programs and the maternal and child health programs under Title V of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) and others) on minority health issues and health disparities. 

•	Completing the required tasks in the scope of work through the administration, coordination and oversight of a National effort to include:

Organizations must indicate the business type, size under the NAICS code 541720 and all appropriate point of contact information.  Your submission must be received in this office by 3:00 PM local time,  February 9, 2006  by delivery, surface mail or fax ONLY at the following address:   HHS/HRSA/DPM, attn:  Debora Pitts, 5600 Fisher Lane, Room 13A-19, Rockville, MD   20857; telephone (301) 443-3789; Fax (301) 443-5462.

<ARCHDATE>01262007
<CONTACT>MARGARET EASTMAN CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487366     mrussell@usgs.gov;
<DESC>This is not a notice for a solicitation.  This is only a Request for Information (RFI).  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any type of agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this RFI.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid; merely a request for information.  Neither draft statement of work nor a complete specification is available at this time.   Any subsequent solicitation will be posted prior to its release.  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is interested in exploring options in creating accurate and current national land cover datasets compatible with the 2001 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD).  This dataset has evolved into a critical component of national environmental assessment efforts and the USGS is interested in insuring current datasets every five years.  Specifically the organization is interested in creating three layers of national land cover data for the conterminous US:  (1) a digital land cover map utilizing the NLCD 2001 land cover legend; (2) percent canopy cover; and (3) percent impervious surface.  In addition, the dataset should be based on 30 meter pixels and include classification accuracy information providing that accuracy standards have been met.  This will ensure that anyone using USGS land cover information has the most current data possible that is of the highest quality.  The methodologies utilized should not preclude this dataset being used to identify land cover changes through comparisons with previous iterations of NLCD data.

<CONTACT>Noelle Spalding, 937-255-3385 x3108
<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center intends to solicit and award contracts to identify and propose improvements to the developmental  MS3320, MS14105 and MS25244 size Arc Fault Circuit Breaker with the  overall objective of meeting fighter platform requirements. The proposed  solutions will meet current dimensions of the government stock listed  MS3320, MS14105, MS25244 thermal circuit breaker. Additionally they shall  have to operate in ambient temperatures from -55 °C to 115 °C (trip curves  can be de-rated to 85% above 95 °C).  Further, the AFCBs must have dual  failure indicators that are 360 degree (continuously) viewable with power  off the aircraft. The AFCBs must hold the trip condition between aircraft  power cycles and be manually resettable from the front of a circuit  breaker panel.  The initial Arc Fault Circuit Breaker development was a  joint program between Navy, Air Force and the FAA to meet aircraft safety  concerns associated with wire arc occurrences. The program is focused on implementing safety,  reliability/maintainability, and sustainment improvements for all  Government-managed platforms currently using MS3320, MS14105 and MS25244  thermal circuit breakers. This program provides designs, prototypes,  repairs, and processes. The AFCB Program integrates the following major element to accomplish  safety and mission-capable objectives: Component redesign to support wiring arc detection and circuit disablement  in the event of a wire arc.  Deliverables:  All products applicable to the attached SOW shall be  delivered to the Government in accordance with requirements established by  the Government Program Manager (or his/her designee). If no comments are  provided within 30 calendar days of deliverable receipt, the deliverable  shall be deemed acceptable by the Government. The Government Program Manager shall be the point of contact to reject or  require correction of any deficiencies found in deliverables.  In the  event of rejection of any deliverable, the Government Program Manager (or  his/her designee) shall notify the contractor in writing as to the  specific reasons for rejection. The goal is to significantly reduce the overall effects of aircraft wire  arc failures to include maintenance costs associated with post mishap  aircraft regeneration. The Government anticipates awarding Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract.  The period of performance will be 20 months with a range of $1-2M dollars. Successful contractors must meet the Minimum Mandatory Requirements. The  Minimum Mandatory Requirements (MMR) reflects the government's minimum  needs and is the lowest threshold acceptable.  Failure to comply with the  MMR will cause a proposal to be rejected.  The MMR’s are as follows.             --In order to avoid organizational and consultant conflicts of  interest the contractor shall comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) 9.505.       -- The Contractor must be able to pick up the program without  disruption to any of the on going AFCB projects and directly proceed. The  contractor shall have documented experience with complex development and  integration programs involving AFCB systems.  At the time of award, the  contractor’s organic staff shall possess expertise to support all  activities in the following functional areas as they relate to aircraft  avionics and electrical systems: Power distribution systems – Requirements definition, integration,  concept, design, analysis, manufacture, qualification, airworthiness  certification, implementation, and sustainment. Rolling Stock – Requirements definition, integration, design/qualification  oversight, airworthiness certification, implementation, sustainment. Materials/Processes – Materials development/characterization, technology  insertion, repair and overhaul concepts, process improvement, and  manufacturing technology.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.     

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not intend to award a contract from this announcement, but is seeking information on available sources for High Resolution Numerical Weather Models.   Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.     

The Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) requests information regarding high-resolution numerical weather models (horizontal resolution on the order of 10-100 meters).  The models will be used by AFWA in conjunction with existing and future mesoscale weather models including the Mesoscale Model Version 5 (MM5) and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Models.  The mesoscale models typically produce forecasts at resolutions of 1 kilometer or coarser.  The new model will be run following completion of MM5 or WRF forecast, using mesoscale-resolution data as input and providing much higher resolution output, over areas and at times of interest.  In particular, AFWA desires information on models to be used over complex terrain and/or urban areas.  

The High-Resolution models should be (1) easily relocatable and reconfigurable by AFWA personnel for use over a newly-defined area, using existing AFWA terrain datasets and other AFWA files, without extensive training on the part of the AFWA personnel; (2) able to generate data for a 50 x 50 meter horizontal grid, with at least 10 vertical levels, within the lowest 1 kilometer of the atmosphere, within 10 minutes, operating on the AFWA computer system; (3) capable of specifying horizontal wind speeds and directions (or u- and v- wind components) at each point within the model domain.  A sample MM5 output data set over mountainous regions will be provided to interested parties.  Send requests for this sample to Robert.Dodson@afwa.af.mil.  

Companies and agencies who possess  High-Resolution models they wish AFWA to evaluate for potential use by AFWA should contact AFWA Program Manager, Robert Dodson.  Responses to the RFI should be submitted electronically via e-mail and be addressed to Robert.Dodson@afwa.af.mil. Submissions must be received no later than 4:30 p.m. central standard time, 15 Feb 06.   

The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.    

The government does not intend to pay for information supplied in response to this Request for Information.  A formal solicitation may not be issued as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.

<SOLNBR>TBD-02
<RESPDATE>021006
<ARCHDATE>04112006
<CONTACT>Pam Willis, 256-955-3388
<DESC>This special announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the business community in providing cost/price support to the SMDC organization via a long-term contract; and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those interest ed business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level.  The capability briefings and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firms or teams ability to perform, however, these wil l be utilized to make final decision concerning type of contracts and possible set-asides.  The responses to this notice are for Government planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a definitive intent to proceed with this acquisition. The contractors will be expected to provide extensive cost and price support during both competitive and sole-source acquisitions conducted by SMDC.  This cost and price support will include acquisitions resulting in a variety of contract types, including cost-plus-fixed-fee;  cost-plus-award-fee; cost-plus-incentive-fee; cost-plus-award-term; firm-fixed-price; firm-fixed-price-labor-categories; and hybrid (which may consist of multiple elements of the other types listed herein).  The resultant contracts ma y be term, completion, or a combination of the two.     The Government anticipates that the cost/price support contract itself will be an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract with fixed-price labor categories.  Cost reimbursable travel and materials line items will also be included if deemed  necessary to provide the support anticipated by the contract-level SOW.  The effort will be performed at various Government sites depending upon specific Government requirements identified in individual task orders issued under the resultant ID/IQ contrac t.  If the Government requirement for cost/price support requires travel of the contractor outside the Huntsville commuting area, appropriate travel costs will be paid on a Cost-reimbursable basis.  While the Government does not intend to restrict the loca tion of the contractor, there are many instances where immediate responsiveness is required.  Contractor interaction may necessitate frequent numbers of visits by selected personnel on a daily or weekly basis.  It is a requirement that the contractor be ca pable of providing the kind of support addressed in this paragraph.   The contract-level SOW will require the contractor to perform cost/price analyses on any and all proposals submitted by other contractors in competitive acquisitions, including awards made by SMDC under the (Small Business Innovative Research) SBIR Program , various SMDC Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs), and other formal and informal source selections, such as those currently listed on the SMDC Business Opportunities Webpage (www.smdc.army.mil/contracts/contracts.html).  Further, the SOW will require simila r support in the cost/price analyses of sole-source proposals for new requirements and/or for change orders to existing contracts.  In the performance of these support activities, the successful contractor will have access to both Government and other-cont ractor proprietary data.    The resultant contract will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that will limit the contractor from participating in any other U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) contracts, unless awarded on a sole-source basis. This restriction will also include competitive acquisitions for other organizations such as Program Executive Office  Missile and Space (PEO-MS), GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE (GMD) JOINT PROGRAM OFFICE (JPO), Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and other outs ide (i.e., non-traditional) customers when conducted by SMDC Contracting and Acquisition Management Office.  The access to proprietary data under the resultant contract could also impact the successful contractors competitiveness in other non-SMDC acquisi tio ns as such OCI restrictions must be reported to the Contracting Officer in any/all competitive acquisitions.   Any business firm interested in the above-described contract opportunity is invited to provide a capability paper to the Government.  Interested firms should submit the capability paper to the Government within 15 days after the date of this announcement; the paper should be emailed to Lynne Washburn at lynne.washburn@smdc.army.mil (title email SMDC Cost/Price Support Capability Paper).   The capability papers should focus on issues that affect the Governments decision concerning pursuit of this acquisition: (1) the breadth and depth of technical expertise to successfully provide the capabilities described above; (2) the capability to quic kly ramp up qualified and trained personnel at the onset of the contract; (3) the capability to manage the personnel required under an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, task order contract, for the effort described above; (4) capability to perform r ealistic cost and price analyses for complex technical, management, integration efforts, and research and development requirements; (5) an understanding of Army, DoD, and Federal Regulations relating to cost and/or price analysis in Federal Contracting; an d (6) a statement agreeing to be bound by the OCI restrictions outlined above. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 1000 employees for this acquisition.  This acquisition is not open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level. In order to be considered for award, offerors must possess a TOP SECRET facility security clearance and be able to provide personnel cleared up-to-and-including the TS/SCI level.  Classified Storage is NOT required at the contractors facility.    Information received will be considered solely for the purposes stated above.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquires and/or responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns or Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business concerns.  The estimated value of this procurement is between $25,000.00 and $100,000.00.  The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.  The acquisition is for DOCKSIDE repairs to the USCGC WIRE (WYTL 65612), a 65 Foot Harbor Tug.  The homeport of the vessel is SAUGERTIES, NEW YORK.  All work will be performed at the vessel’s homepier. The performance period is TWENTY-NINE (29) calendar days and is expected to begin on or about 05 MAY 2006.  The scope of the acquisition is for the renewing and repairing of various items aboard the USCGC WIRE (WYTL 65612.)  This work will include, but is not limited to:  Preserve Weather Deck; Clean Exhaust Pipes; Chemically Clean Sewage Piping System; Renew Deck Covering Systems; Install Port Light; Remove Drain Valve; Remove Vent Piping; Install Emergency Ballast Lights; Renew Fire and Smoke Detection System. Trained welders, who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures, shall accomplish all welding and brazing.  At the present time, it is expected that the acquisition will be issued as a small business set aside.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305 if your firm is HUBZone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to dawn.j.dabney@uscg.mil or by fax at (757) 628-4676.  Questions may be referred to Dawn J. Dabney at (757) 628-4636.  In your response you must include: (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; and (c) past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable.  Your response is required by February 09, 2006.  Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone Set-aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.   Contractors are also reminded that should this acquisition become a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business set aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone set-aside or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in Small Business set-aside acquisition.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone Small Business set-aside, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside or a Small Business set-aside, will be posted in FedBizOpps website at http://www.eps.

<SOLNBR>W9113M060003
<RESPDATE>022506
<ARCHDATE>04262006
<CONTACT>Diana McCown, 256-955-5904
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested commercial sources by the U.S. Army Space & Missile Defense Command (SMDC) regarding the ability of firms to develop, integrate, and test a 100kW-class High Energy Laser Technology Demonstrator (HELTD).  The HELTD will consist of a high-power, solid-state laser (SSL) subsystem; beam control subsystem (BCS); battle management, command, control, and communications (BMC3) subsystem; thermal management subsystem; and electrical power/recharge subsyst em integrated on a mobile hybrid-electric tactical vehicle with trailer (if required).  The type of tactical vehicle will be determined during early systems engineering studies, but maximizing specific power while minimizing development cost for the HELTD is desired. This notice is published in accordance with FAR Part 15.201, and is an RFI for planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment by the U.S. Government, nor should it be construed as such. Respondents are advised t hat SMDC is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any inform ation submitted in response to this RFI. The Government WILL NOT award a contract on the basis of this RFI, and WILL NOT reimburse the costs incurred by providing the information requested under this notice. This RFI is open to any capable and qualified U. S. commercial sources, and partnering is encouraged.    The goal of the HELTD Program is to demonstrate the capability to successfully engage and defeat a variety of airborne targets with a high energy laser (HEL) beam by the end of FY13.  The airborne and ballistic threats may include rockets, mortars, artille ry, precision-guided munitions, surface-to-air missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The HELTD is not currently envisioned to be deployable as a weapon system, but it is intended to support future transition to a major acquisition program.  Specifically,  the HELTD must be capable of receiving multiple track data files from a government-provided acquisition sensor, classifying and identifying objects, establishing laser-quality track files, determining the optimum time to engage the target, providing safe- guards to preclude inadvertent irradiation of friendly assets, selecting an optimum aimpoint to engage the target, directing and maintaining the HEL beam on the aimpoint, and verifying kill of the target or retargeting, as necessary.  The HELTD will be use d to demonstrate resolution of technical issues related to SSL beam control (beam and wavefront shaping and/or phase control); SSL beam propagation in a simulated battlefield environment or poor weather conditions; pointing and tracking (timely and  accurate hand-off from an acquisition sensor, aimpoint selection and tracking algorithms, jitter control and boresight errors, illuminator and infrared sensor performance); optics performance (window survivability, uncooled optics and coatings, alignment, adaptive optics and/or fast steering mirrors); and lethality (SSL beam coupling to the target, target kill mechanisms, and fluence requirements). The initial HELTD concept must be flexible enough to accommodate alternative SSL subsystem architectures.  Two candidate SSL technologies are being developed in the laboratory under the Joint High Power Solid State Laser (JHPSSL) Phase 3 program, which has  a goal of demonstrating a minimum of 100kW output power by the end of FY08.  A complete set of thresholds and goals for JHPSSL Phase 3 may be provided on request.   SMDC currently plans a downselect for the SSL subsystem technology from these two SSL cand idates no later than early FY09 for use as the HELTD SSL subsystem.   The HELTD effort is envisioned to consist of distinct contractor teams for systems engineering and systems integration.  The Systems Engineering team will define the initial HELTD concept; make subsystem technology recommendations; and continuously balance cost, schedule, and performance requirements.  This Systems Engineering team will also support coordination with additional governme nt stakeholders including USAADASCH, UAMBL, and PM Cruise Missile Defense Systems (CMDS).  This Systems Engineering team must assess candidate subsystem technologies including the J-HPSSL Phase 3 contractors without perceived or actual conflicts of interes t or concerns for unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information.    The System Integration team will be responsible for the design and development of the BCS and BMC3 subsystems, integration of all HELTD subsystems on the mobile platform, and demonstration of HELTD performance at the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facilit y (HELSTF) at the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  The BCS must be capable of receiving and transmitting the HEL beam as provided by the selected SSL technology.  The BMC3 must be capable of receiving target handover track information from an acquisition  radar (GFE) such as the WSMR range radars.  The responder must have prior successful experience in developing and testing air and missile defense weapon systems.   The government is considering one possible contracting strategy that would provide an HELTD System Engineering prime contractor for a period of performance from contract award until shortly after government SSL subsystem downselect.  This Systems Engineeri ng contractor would not be one of the J-HPSSL Phase 3 contractors or any other potential subsystem provider.  During this initial performance period, the System Integrator, potentially a major subsystem provider, is a sub-contractor under the System Engine er.  The System Integrator would revert to prime contractor for a second period of performance that follows SSL subsystem downselect and runs through contract completion.  During the second performance period, the System Engineer is now a sub-contractor un der the System Integrator.  Responders to this RFI are encouraged to recommend potential alternative contracting strategies. INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS: Responders (individual contractors or potential teams) should provide a high-level description of their capabilities in laser and beam control technologies and their capabilities for systems engineering and integrating weapon sy stem concepts for air and missile defense operations.  This includes identifying capabilities to manage the development process within a structured framework, i.e. Acquisition Systems Management Model, Technology Program Management Model, etc.  Responders should be as specific as possible, and should identify unique technical development experience and qualifications. Responders should also provide comments/information in the following areas: a) ROM cost estimates for the BCS and BMC3 subsystems and HELTD s ystem systems engineering and integration, b) feasibility for integrating the HELTD onto a hybrid-electric vehicle and the resulting options and availability for electrical power and thermal management, c) feasibility for incorporating vibration control on  a mobile platform supporting a laser subsystem operating at 1.0 microns, d) the need , risk and cost for incorporating adaptive optics to sustain beam quality to the target based on the given target set, e) track handover requirements from an acquisition radar, and f) techniques for promptly restoring optical alignment after vehicle movement.   The government is also considering an interim demonstration of a fixed-site SSL Breadboard System capable of successfully engaging a 60mm mortar by the end of FY10.  Responders should provide comments on the feasibility of this interim demonstration includ ing projected cost impacts.  This SSL Breadboard System would be composed of a ruggedized JHPSSL Phase 3 device, a beam control system to be recommended, adaptive optics (if required), beam control softwa re derived from the Tactical High Energy Laser (THEL) program, and the range radar at the White Sands Missile Range.     The responses should reference W9113M060003/HIGH ENERGY LASER TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATOR (HELTD), not exceed 15 pages in length, and should be delivered to the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN: SMDC-RDTC-TDD, PAUL SIMPSON, P.O. Box 1500, Hunt sville, AL 35807-3801 no later than 25 Feb 06. Electronic submission to paul.simpson@smdc.army.mil is the preferred method of submission. All respondents shall include their assigned Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code. Responders are further requ ired to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees. Due to the nature of this potential effort, no foreign country sources will be considered. Proprietary Data: All information su bmittals containing proprietary data should be appropriately marked. It is the responder's responsibility to clearly define to the Government what is considered to be proprietary data.

<SUBJECT>58 -- BAA SURVEILLANCE and RECONNAISSANCE
<DESC>This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in 
FAR 6.102(d) (2).  The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is soliciting proposals to increase operator Surveillance and Reconaissance (SR) agility and options through the rapid insertion of maturing and emerging SR technologies specifically for: Sensors; Tagging, Tracking, and Locating; and supporting technologies such as SR Communications and Power management.  The SR technology will be characterized, vetted in experiments and demonstrations, and in user exercises to globally track targets.  Residual “operational prototypes” are then made available for future employment consideration.  

The objective of this BAA is to provide USSOCOM with innovative, unique, creative SR solutions, technologies, and state of the art approaches and improvement in the following SR areas: 

Sensors Guidance: Sensing technologies should consider all observable phenomenology (seismic, magnetic, infrared, acoustic, electromagnetic, hyper-spectral, multi-spectral, nuclear, biometric, biological, chemical, etc.).  Ideally, sensing devices will be delivered and set-up using remote/hands-off techniques.  Sensors must be rugged, capable of withstanding environmental changes, and should be small in size and have wide bandwidth capability.  Sensor objectives include combining seismic, magnetic, acoustic, and microwave sensing technologies into single units where feasible; reducing sensor size; improving power management/endurance; improving reliability/reduce false alarm rates; improving capability to remotely emplace the sensors.
Tagging, Tracking, and Locating (TTL) Technology Guidance: The Government requires an immediate capability to precisely tag, track, and locate global targets.  The TTL systems must provide the users with enhanced situational awareness information from various emplaced devices.  Since the requirements for TTL are too broad to be satisfied by a single device, the broader requirement is for a toolbox of TTL devices integrated into an interoperable architecture that would provide ready options for use in short/no notice crisis.  TTL technologies include but are not limited to integrated global positioning devices, improved optical tags, improved waveform tags, biometrics, and signature exploitation for automatic identification/detection.  

General SR technology areas of interest are:  1) Miniaturization of sensing technology, communication modules and antennae, 2) Ruggedized and hardened hardware, both in fabrication and packaging, able to withstand a variety of environmental conditions and temperatures, 3) Lightweight (to enable an individual to easily carry in a pocket or small pack) 4) Self-powered (long-life battery, solar, friction dynamo, other) 5) Disguisable 6) Remote autonomous applications, 7) Stand off applications.

It is not the intent of this solicitation to establish new facilities, rather, to identify institutions that have demonstrated integration and development capabilities and have the necessary facilities to meet the objectives described in this BAA.  This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selection.  All are invited to submit a project proposal not exceeding 20 pages of text that describes the following:  1) The development and integration objective,  2) The development approach, 3) Related work by the investigator or proposer, 4) Anticipated contributions to USSOCOM programs, 5) An estimate of overall costs (including indirect) for up to a three year effort, 6) Proposed payment milestones and program schedule, and 7) A curriculum vitae of the principal investigator(s) appended with any supporting information, such as reprints, that will assist in the evaluation of the pre-proposal submission.  Additionally, all offers must identify any rights and restrictions that exist on their technical data, and all offerors are advised that restrictions on technology transfers outside of the U.S. will be imposed on all media created IAW this BAA.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to USSOCOM SOALK-KBA 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL 33621 (Attn.: H92222-05-R-0003) on or before 12:00 NOON, on 6 December 04.  

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by USSOCOM.  Small businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for small business due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. The government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.   

 
This program will be run at the U.S. SECRET/NOFORN level of classification. A program Security Classification Guide (SCG) for this program is available on request and required for guidance on proposal preparation. Performers must have required U.S. personnel clearances, cleared facilities, storage, and processing capabilities to bid on this solicitation as defined in the program SCG. In the event of discrepancies between information presented from this synopsis or the SCG, the SCG takes precedence.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  1) Practical application and operational technical merits of the proposed SR technology,  2) Demonstration of current emerging development model device,     3) Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator(s), and availability of facilities to support and conduct the integration, demonstrations, training, and deployment of systems and supporting architectures 4) Relevance of the proposed SR technology application to USSOCOM program priorities, 5) Realism of the proposed costs.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists. 

The Government may award single or multiple contracts in accordance with technical priority and funding availability.  The government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government reserves the right to select for award, all, some, or none of the parts of a proposal from proposal respondents. Proposals may be selected and/or award decisions made without discussions or negotiations.     

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE: There will be no other requests for proposals or other formal solicitations regarding this announcement.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OFFLINE SOLID PHASE MICRO EXTRACTION (SPME) SAMPLING SYSTEM
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
OFFLINE SOLID PHASE MICRO EXTRACTION (SPME) SAMPLING SYSTEM 


Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercially develop its Offline Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) Sampling System technology.

Background: The standard approach to SPME analysis is limited by the fact that it is a one-use technique. Usually a sample is extracted with a SPME fiber and the fiber is desorbed onto a gas chromatograph for analysis. By the time another SPME extraction can be done, the sample atmosphere can be changed, altered, become unavailable or dissipate.

Description:  LLNL’s Offline SPME sampling system uses a commercially available deactivated sample bottle to sub sample gas atmospheres that can be held stable for weeks at a time, thereby holding organic constituents stable from breakdown.

Advantages:  Using this specially designed system, SPME samples could be taken numerous times without a loss of the original sample atmosphere or changes to the initial organic composition.

Feature	Benefit
Specially deactivated sample bottle	Holding time for SPME analysis extended significantly (weeks to months) depending on the compound class

Multiple SPME samples can be taken from each gas sampling event

Allows the addition of surrogates and internal standards
Universal design	Allows the application of this technique to anyone using currently purchased SPME hardware (syringes, fibers)
Adaptable to your needs	Configurations using both standard compression or quick connect fittings
Amenable to automation	Design includes hardware for use on the CTC Combi PAL line of autosamplers.
Potential Applications:  

Homeland Security, Government, and commercial applications for this technology include materials analysis, environmental testing, OSHA monitoring, QC analysis of foods and products, and industrial effluent monitoring.  

Development Status:  

LLNL is in the process of patenting this invention. In the meantime, LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Offline Solid Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) Sampling System technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

<SUBJECT>D--On Line Medical Subscription Database
<DESC>The Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN 11) intends to negotiate on a sole source  basis under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1(a)(2) for a base year with four one-year optional renewal periods, with UpToDate, Inc., 95 Sawyer Road, Waltham, MA 02453  The agency need is for an online clinical reference website. The government has determined that UpToDate, Inc. is the only responsible source able to provide these services because UpToDate is a unique clinical reference that gives current answers to patient care, diagnosis and treatment questions in seconds at the point-of-care. A well-known faculty of over 3,000 authors writes the original text. Inclusion of specific recommendations for diagnosis and treatment make UpToDate unique among clinical information databases. UptoDate_s unique Features & Benefits include in-house physician reviews for over 300 medical journals and incorporate significant clinical findings daily. The benefit of UpToDate is that it improves organizational efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of care; by helping physicians stay current on studies, trials and medical information, and clinical management.  The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and the Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes but responses received on or before February 9, 2006 will be evaluated.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Information should be submitted to the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN 11), Attn: Joyce Miller (90CSC), 1481 W. Tenth St., Indianapolis, IN 46202, Phone 317/554-0207 or Fax 317/554-2000.

1Q:	When the amendment comes out will I receive a copy or will I need to contact the general contractor that I am working with?  Here are some questions that we have:
1A:	The amendment will issue on FedBizOpps. 
2Q:	The work hours are 8-4:30 can we go beyond these hours and work over time or on weekends?  Is the deadline date flexible?
2A:	Work may take place between the hours of 7 AM and 5 PM, Monday through Friday, except designated Federal Holidays.  Work can be scheduled after normal working hours including weekends and holidays.  If the contractor wants to work on the project at other than normal working hours, a request shall be submitted to the contracting officer 5 days prior to starting work on the weekend, holiday or after normal working hours.  The deadline is not flexible.
3Q:	What kind of ceiling is it?  Drop ceiling?
3A:	The ceiling is suspended and the tiles are 2 ft. by 2 ft. 
4Q:	Do you have an existing path way for riser cabling?

5A:	The vendor is not responsible for fire stopping, conduit or sleeves.
6Q:	Are there other floor plans showing the location of the MCR, demark, and old computer room on the 3rd floor?
6A:	The floor plans available show floors 5 through 7.  The MDF is located in the basement.  The new MCR is located on floor 5, room 510.  There is no longer a requirement for access to the old MCR on floor 3.
7Q:	Where are the IDF’s located?  Are they on top of each other and typical per floor?

7A:	The IDF's are located behind the restrooms and adjacent to the electrical room.  With the exception of the first floor IDF, the other IDF's are stacked.

8Q:	Please identify the General Decision (Davis Bacon) number for this project.

8A:	This is a Service Contract Act contract.  The Wage Determination Number is 1994-2339, Revision 25, Date of Last Revision: 05/23/2005.  A copy of the Wage Determination is attached. 

9Q:	During the walk thru it was stated by the Government that all cutovers will be completed by others, can this be verified and added to the amended SOW?

9A.	Moving telephone lines is not part of the SOW and therefore not required.  

10Q:	The Government now states that they no longer need Fiber Optic Cable installed.  Is this correct?

10A.	Yes.  Section 3.2.10 – DELETE reference to placing a 2-strand Fiber Optic connector cable with ends, from the new VA MCR, room 510, and the old VA MCR located on floor 3.  This work is eliminated as a requirement for this task order.

11Q:	It was noted by many of the Vendors that the cable distance may exceed the maximum distance of 297ft. (from the 7th floor down to the 5th). If this is the case the cabling and all attached electronics will no longer be in warranty.  Can the Government make a footage check using the new cable tray from the furthest install point to the termination closet?

11A.	Based on review of the length of cable runs, the government has determined that the cable runs will be within the maximum distance of 297 ft referenced.  

12Q:	Could the Government please provide a manufacture and part number for the ceiling tiles in case of accidental damage during install?  ( It was stated during the walk thru that the Vendor would be responsible to replace).

12A.	1.  Ceiling tiles in the office areas:  Capaul (Celotex) Symphony f.  2.  Ceiling tile in the corridor areas:  Celotex Sand Micro.  3.  Ceiling grid throughout:  Celotex 15/16” Classic Stab System.  

13Q:	Which floors will not need to have the 100 pair cable terminated?  Also please verify who (and when if it is the Vendors responsibility) will terminate the respective cables.

13A.	The contractor shall terminate the MDF ends of all cables.  The contractor shall terminate the 100-pair riser cables in the IDFs on floors 1,4,5,6, and 7, and the 25-pair cable that shall run from the floor 7 IDF to the Penthouse.  In the IDFs on floors 2 and 3, the contractor shall leave a twenty-foot coil of the 100-pair riser cables to be terminated later by someone other than the contractor. 

14Q:	Who is responsible for fire stopping?  (stated during walk thru that the Government will complete this task)

14A.	The contractor is not responsible for fire stopping. 

15Q:	Light fixture in 5th floor closet is out of code in relation to the cabling.  Will the Government have this fixed before testing and acceptance of the cable?

15A.	The light fixture will be relocated permanently, as necessary, so that the ballast does not interfere with required testing.  			

16Q:	Bidders are asked in the SOW to complete a timeline.  During the walk thru we were told that the furniture for the install would not be ready until mid March.  If this is so, we need a specific timeline from the Government to base our assumptions of installation time frames.  Also included in the SOW is the requirement for the removal of all old cables.  Please note: This can not be completed until all of the customers have moved (potential scheduling impact).

16A.	The Government estimates that termination at the workstations (3.3) can be accomplished during the week of March 6, 2006.  Section 3.1.11 – DELETE requirement to disconnect and remove old riser cabling and termination blocks from MDF.  This work portion is eliminated as a requirement. 

17Q:  Is it correct that the government will install all backboards and string all conduits?

17A.	Yes, the all backboards and strings will be in place by the first day the wiring vendor begins the job.

 
18Q:  Is it correct that successful contractor will not be required to terminate the 100 pair on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floors?

18A.	Section 1.2 – AMEND reference to termination of vertical cabling in IDFs on floors two and three.  These IDFs will not be built out prior to completion of this task.  The vendor shall leave a twenty-foot (20) coil of riser cable dead-ended in the IDFs on floors two and three.  Vendor shall terminate other end of riser cable in MDF as specified in the Statement of Work.

19Q:  What are the specifications for the data Cabinets?

19A.	The vendor shall provide two (2) telecom cabinets.

Enclosed telecom cabinets –  defined as consisting of metallic enclosure with removable front and rear doors, accessible through the bottom, and containing a 7-foot, by 19-inch date rack, and electrical power source.

Enclosed Telecom Cabinet (84” x 19”):  (type presently used in old VA MCR)

	Hubbell – HLU-86520

20Q:  What provisions for parking is there (Small construction Trailer 8’ X 12’)?

20A.	Two parking spots will be provided inside the building underground parking for two contractor vehicles.  There is the potential that space could be made available for a construction trailer, however since most of the areas have already been assigned to the general contractor, the space is not guaranteed.  For bidding purposes, contractors should assume that no space will be available for a trailer.  Space in the building will be made available for the contractor to set up a field office.   
 
21Q:  Is the fiber still needed? And if so does the temporary 2 fiber that has to run in the stairwell have to be plenum rated? And is the successful contractor responsible to remove the temporary 2 fiber cable? If so when, after February 24 , 2006?

21A.	Section 3.2.10.  DELETE reference to placing a 2-strand Fiber Optic connector cable with ends, from the new VA MCR, room 510, and the old VA MCR located on floor 3.  This work operation has been eliminated as a requirement for this task.
 
22Q:  On the fifth floor are the 12 double drops additional to the 35 Triple drops?

22A.	Yes.  The twelve "D" data drops shown on the fifth floor plan are to be placed in addition to the 35 triple drops.  There are to be two data drops placed at each of the twelve "D" locations.
 
23Q:  On the Seventh floor the plan shows 69 triple drops, the RFQ shows 67?

23A.	Section 3.2.1. CHANGE quantity of triplex drops and jacks to sixty-nine (69) at locations on the floor plan showing filled lone triangles and “M”s. [ 39 lone jacks and 30 “M” jacks ]
 
24Q:  If we follow the cable tray the using the shortest distance on the seventh floor, is successful contractor responsible to keep the long runs under 297 feet in length?

24A.	The contractor should find that even the longest horizontal cable run will be under three hundred (300) linear feet.  The contractor shall use existing cable trays and conduits for all horizontal wire runs.
 
25Q:  What brand and model number of the system furniture will be used?

25A.	The contractor is responsible for providing sixty (60) three-jack faceplates for the systems furniture.  The jack is the Maxon 3PF-RJ45.
 
26Q:  If the system furniture is installed after the end date, will successful contractor be required to return to run cables in the furniture, terminate, and test?

26A.	Yes.   See Section 3.3 Workstation Extension Task.  The systems furniture will not be in place by the February 24 deadline.
 
27Q:  How long does the Department of Homeland Security background check take?

27A.	See Security Procedures Attached. 

28Q:  And if this check takes time will the end date reflect this delay?

28A.	No.  

29Q:  How do you want the Cat-6 test results, on CD or paper copies or both?

29A.	CD In any Microsoft Office product.
 
30Q:  Is there a Specific format used for identification-cut sheets?

30A.	Yes. Excel Spreadsheet 

31Q:  Is there any flexibility in the February 24, 2006 completion date? If our crew works faithfully every day to complete the areas needed first will there be any problem, if needed, finishing after February 24, 2006 ? (Example; system furniture, risers to 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 8th)

31A.	No.   Placing cabling in the systems furniture must be completed after the February 24 deadline, but the cabling must be run in advance and coiled above the ceiling until the furniture installation takes place.
 
32Q:  Labeling (3.2.4) The TIA-606 labeling standards outline the consecutive numbering of the jack locations according to the closet. This makes any technician, experienced and familiar with the TIA-606 standard, to find the wiring closet, rack, patch panel and port from any jack location. This standard does not reflect the location of the jack because you always work from the jack when patching and troubleshooting. Numbering the jacks for example “5A-1A-01” translates to “5A” = fifth floor closet A, “1A” = first rack or cabinet, panel A, “01” = patch panel port 1. Using a labeling scheme that requires the jack location could require more patch panels, wire management and more rack units. What labeling scheme will be required, TIA-606?

32A.	Reference to the TIA-606 standard is to ensure that the vendor uses a labeling standard to follow.  However, the following is adequate:

Unique Identification Numbers – defined as a numbering system that will differentiate each data and voice CAT-6 cable from another, and WSIs by floor number.  With only one IDF on each floor, it is better to use the floor number as one part of the wire, jack, and patch panel port numbering system.

33Q.:	During the walk through I got the impression that there will be service loops left on floors 2, 3, 4 until the remaining HVAC Duct work is removed, at which time termination and testing will be done?

Second part to the question is whom will be doing this and if the previous awarded contractor is to test and terminate can a partial payment for the work completed to date and or can partial payment for materials be made upon award? This may extend the date if the duct work demolition isn't complete in time for termination and testing with the given completion date of February, 24 2006.

33A:	Twenty-foot coils of 100-pair riser cabling will be left on floors 2 and 3.  The riser cable on floor 4 shall be terminated and tested as specified.  All cable to and in the MDF shall be terminated there.  Termination and testing of cables in the IDFs on floors 2 and 3 are not the responsibility of the contractor.  The contractor may request partial payment in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation procedures. 

34Q:	I have a question one on site request was for white for Voice and blue for Data at the extension jack (RJ45) to facilitate with further Identification?

34A:	Yes.  That is why two (2) colors are specified – one color for voice and the other for data. 

35Q:	I have a question related to the MDF Backboards all will be in place prior to start of work?

35A:	All MDF back boards will be in place prior to work commencing on all floors except floors 2 and 3.  The closets on these two floors will not be constructed until a later date.  

36Q:	I have a question regarding the fifth floor cabinet mounted to the floor, will this be done by the vendor or another party?

36A:	The cabinets are not mounted to the floor.  They are bolted to each other.

37Q:	There had been a question as to where space was available for the staging of our equipment?

37A:	The exact location has not yet been determined but an area will be made available for staging of equipment.

<DESC>This amendment is issued to change the citation of applicable Federal Acquisition Circulars and DCN; to add specification that items supplied must be of new manufacture; to add specification that trailer mounts to secure for air transport are require d; to add clause DFARS 252.22--7036 and delete clause DFARS 252.225-7001 from the list of clauses in DFARS 252.22-7001. All changes are incorporated into the description below.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the purchase of commercial items,  prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number W911S8-06-Q-0003 is applicable and is issued as a request for quotations. The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08 and DCN 20051220. This requirement is t otally set-aside for small business concerns with a NAICS Code of 335129 and a corresponding size standard of 500 employees. The description of the commercial item is for portable light tower systems and replacement light bulbs, all of new manufacture, and  reads as follows: CLIN 0001, 26 EACH, PORTABLE LIGHT TOWER SYSTEMS. Each system shall meet the following requirements: Trailer mounted generator and light mast, with four 1000-watt metal halide lights; towable by military vehicles with pintle hook; traile r equipped with sturdy retractable outriggers for support, and tie-down mounts to secure system for air transport; system stable for use in winds up to 50 MPH; generator, water cooled deisel engine, minimum 6 kilowatts output; lights mounted on a mast exte ndable to minimum 30 feet in height; electric winch to raise and lower mast; ballast indicator lights; lights individually controlled with circuit breakers; 1 each 120V/20A receptable and 1 each 240v/30A receptable. CLIN 0002, 26 EACH, REPLACEMENT LIGHT BU LBS, 1000 WATT METAL HALIDE. Delivery time shall be no later than 60 days from date of order, to the DOL Central Receiving Point, Fort Lewis, WA 98433-9500. Acceptance will be at the destination. FOB point is destination. The selection resulting from this request for quotations will be made on the basis of the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote from a responsible quoter with acceptable or neutral past performance. Past performance will be evaluated using a Performance Questionnaire, which can be do wnloaded along with instructions at http://www.lewis.army.mil/doc (select the 'Request for Quotes' tab and the forms listed under this combined synopsis/solicitation number). The Government may also obtain past performance information from other sources. O nce the Contracting Officer has decided to whom an order will be issued, a unilateral order will be issued using a SF 1449. A purchase order will be in existence once the Contracting Officer has signed the order. Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offeror s-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. An addendum to this provision is applicable, in which paragraphs (g) and (h) of FAR 52.212-1 are deleted. Wherever the words 'offer', 'proposal', 'offerors', or similar terms are used in this solicitation or  any provision, they shall be read to mean 'quote', 'quotation', 'quoter', 'vendor' or similar corresponding term to eflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. Local Fort Lewis clauses 52.111-4131, Commercial Vehicle Access to Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate Program, 52.111-4132, Identification of Contractors Employees  Fast Access Gate Program, and 52.111-4004, Electronic Commerce, apply to this acquisition. Local clause 52.111-4131 sta tes: 'Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice. Current access information may be obtained by calling 1 -877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342). (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. These gates will be open for inbound commercial  vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours. These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays. On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial veh icles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5). Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained. All commercial vehicles will be searched. The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post. The Co ntractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis. If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gat e guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority. On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12 feet-5 inches clearance) will require a time stamped 'searched' label to gain access to North Fort Lewis. 'Searched' labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate. Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12 feet-5 i nches in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis. The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a 'searched' label. The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply wit h the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis. (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Char lie or Delta. During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate. All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes. Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at  the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate. Th e contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes. (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they  are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.' Local clause 52.111-4132 states: 'a. Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a f ast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis. A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week. Contractor emplo yees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visito rs pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed). The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time. A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program. The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program. b. The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis. The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the  fast access identification card. If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee. If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee. If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fa st access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee. c. If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer perf orms work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change. If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall  immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day. An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or vis itors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract. The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor. Any such chan ges shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract. d. Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees. If an employees identification b adge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circums tances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered. e. Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract. The  identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s). The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for w hich it was issued. f. The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232 -25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for. g. If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.' ADDENDUM TO CLAUSES 52.111-4131, 52.111-4132, AND 52 .111-4133: Employees who require access to Fort Lewis to perform work under this contract may obtain a Government sponsored identification badge. The identification card process has been contracted out and the cost of the identification card shall be borne  by the contractor. Current established costs are: $99.00 for company start-up and $99.00 per individual.

If you choose not to obtain a Fast Access Badge, you can obtain permission for a 30-day pass by contacting the ID Card Facility (Waller Hall). This process may be changed witho ut prior notification, but any long-term badge received by you will continue to be valid until its expiration date.(End of Addendum to 52.111-4131, 4132, and 4133).
