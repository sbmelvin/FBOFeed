<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Digilab, of Cambridge, MA, for acquisition of one (1) Infrared Microimaging Platform System, to be used in the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, at NIST to perform infrared imaging.  Award will be made under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.*****Installation and training at the NIST laboratory shall be included.  In addition, a one-year on-site warranty on parts and labor, shall be included.*****Sole source determination is based on the Division's need to be able to perform infrared imaging on a system meeting the following specifications, which Digilab is uniquely qualified to do: High intensity water-cooled ceramic IR source (range 9,600-50 cm-1), a high spectral throughput air bearing 60? Michelson interferometer with 0.10 cm-1 resolution (0.075 cm-1 unapodized) at 2000 cm-1 , and dynamic alignment of tilt compensation, as well as dynamic velocity correction, which are both essential to recording an accurate and reproducible interferogram.  In addition, the Digilab system is the only system that during step-scan operation the spectrometer is able to sample up to five channels during each step for multiple channel spectroscopy.  For example, this system allows for the simultaneous measurements of static, 0o phase and 90o phase spectra during modulation experiments. No other system can perform this operation, necessary to the operation of infrared imaging.  The Digilab system is also the only system with a theoretical free-scanning range, which can cover the range 0-63,200 cm-1 without the need for "folding" or other numerical techniques, which would restrict the scanning range and potential use at shorter wavelengths.  Finally, the DigiLab focal plane array detector is capable of multiple thermal cycles without de-lamination of the MCT detector material from the silicon read-out electronics.  This technology prevents a very costly ($50,000.00 repair cost) failure mechanism from occurring and is a DigiLab patented feature.*****Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within ninety (90) days or less after receipt of order (ARO).*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by August 12, 2002, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.*****

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has a requirement for the purchase of a MALDI TOF TOF Mass Spectrometer .  The instrument will provide the NIEHS Mass Spectrometry Workgroup/Protein Microcharacterization Resource program with the capability of carrying out tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometric sequence characterization of peptides to large polypeptides as obtained, for example, from tryptic digests of 1- and 2-D gel separated proteins in a high throughput format.  The instrument must incorporate state-of-the-art ionization, ion optics and detection, including delayed ion extraction and linear and reflectron capabilities.  The instrument must be capable of obtaining MS and true MS/MS spectra from low attomoles of sample and of providing high resolution MS/MS fragment ion data across the complete MS/MS spectrum.  The collision energy of the MS/MS experiments must be variable from low to high energies.  The instrument must be capable of isolation of the precursor ion from adjacent ( m>3 Da at m/z 1000 ) ions in MS/MS experiments.  The system must include a MALDI target autoloader capable of unattended operation.  The autoloader must be compatible with multiple plate formats including high-density arrays of robotically applied spots, membranes or disposable inserts.  The autoloader should be compatible with current Voyager De STR sample plates.  The autoloader should include a scanner to read and select bar-coded sample plates from the cassette to insert in the main vacuum chamber.  The scanned code should then be checked against the experiment to be run on that sample plate.   The acquisition and data analysis software must include a locally installed copy of the Mascot Search Engine and an integrated Oracle database.  It must have the ability to: submit MS data only, MS data and then MS/MS data, and both MS data and MS/MS data together for automated database search; batch queue to submit multiple sample sets for data base searching; support complete ICAT report information for differential expression including ratios, standard deviation, peptide masses, modifications, and heavy and light labels; define levels of user privileges for full or partial data access; and to examine the detailed results of a specific sample location on the MALDI plate via a Protein Peptide Table that lists all of the proteins found in the sample and Spectrum View that is updated with the corresponding information associated with a selected sample location on the target.  Data submitted by the offeror will be used to evaluate the proposed instrumentation as follows:   The system will be evaluated on the basis of sensitivity in the MS/MS mode as defined as a combination of the signal-to-noise ratio of the largest fragment ion in the MS/MS spectrum of a peptide of mass ca. 1500 Da such as glu1-fibrinopeptide B obtained at sample levels of 100 fmol and 1 pmol.  Evaluation of instrument resolution in the MS/MS mode will be based on the entire mass range of fragment ions from a ca. 1500 Da peptide.  True MS/MS capabilities will be determined based on the mass window passed during precursor ion selection and the relative loss of the precursor signal during the selection process.  Collision ion energies will be demonstrated by observation of MS/MS spectra from higher mass peptides or smaller protein (4000 Da or greater).   This is a firm, fixed-price requirement and will be issued under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.   Delivery shall be expected within 120 days of award of the contract.  The requirement may not be awarded until the next Government fiscal year in October 2002.  Submit request for solicitation in writing to the above address or FAX the request to (919) 541-5117.  All requests must include the Solicitation number and marked to the attention of Mary W. McConnell.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334513 with a size standard of 500 employees.  The solicitation will be available on or about August 5, 2002.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered.!!

<DESC>plans, performance and products. The contractor must provide the following capabilities: engineering analysis, system-wide engineering and network analysis/re-engineering, USPTO document management Systems (DMS), electronic filing and Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) standards, infrastructure engineering support services, security engineering, PKI engineering, communications infrastructure engineering and deployment, network engineering and deployment, business communications information technology, and technical support issues.

The PTO expects to award two performance-based service contracts as a result of this competition.  One of the contract awards will be to a small business.  The NAICS Code is "541519-OTHER COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES", for the small business contract. 
 The PTO intends to award each contract with a basic period of performance of one year with four (4) one-year options for renewal.  It is anticipated that the contracts will be Cost-Plus-Award Fee with task ordering provisions.  The anticipated annual level of effort for this requirement is 200,000 hours for the base year, and 180,000 hours for each of the options.  Businesses will be required to be located within the Washington, DC, metropolitan area to respond to the Government's advance 30 minutes requirement for meetings at the USPTO in Arlington, VA.      

The PTO would like to emphasize that the winning offerors of the SETA requirement will have a role as a close confidential advisor to the PTO. The SETA contractor will assist the PTO in evaluating the proposals, performance, and products of other contractors, thereby giving them access to proprietary information about potential competitors. The SETA contractor will also have access to proprietary, source-selection sensitive, or otherwise restricted information. Because of the close confidential relationship required of the SETA contractor, the PTO is concerned that this will cause other private sector firms to be reluctant in pursuing future work with the PTO, and that the release of proprietary information to the SETA contractor would have an adverse impact on competition in future procurements with the PTO.  In order to mitigate these concerns, the PTO intends to impose strong Conflict of Interest (COI) restrictions on the SETA contractor. These COI restrictions include the prohibition of the winning offeror, its parent, any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, or successors in interest, consultants, and subcontractors from participating (in any capacity) in any PTO procurements, other than those activities in direct support of the SETA contract, throughout the duration of the SETA contract (including options) plus an additional five years. The SETA contractor, its parent, any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, or successors in interest, consultants, and subcontractors will be prohibited from using any proprietary information obtained in support of the SETA contract for the duration of the SETA contract (including options) plus an additional five years or until the information becomes part of the public domain, whichever comes latest. The SETA contractor will be required to certify annually that it, its parent, any affiliates, subsidiaries, or successors in interest, consultant, and subcontractors are in compliance with the PTO COI requirements.

Electronic Copies: An electronic copy of the solicitation, when released, will be available as follows: World Wide Web Access (http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/projanno.htm). 

Information concerning this announcement and other USPTO business opportunities can be found at the following site:  (http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm)

This acquisition will be conducted using streamline measures, to include some portions that will be presented orally by offerors determined to be in the competitive range. Details will be contained in the solicitation.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to award a sole source contract for the continuing development, improvement and maintenance of the Clinical Research Information Management System (CRIMSON) of the NIAID.  Services will be procured on a sole source basis from Systex, Inc.  Systex, Inc. possesses the unique ability to handle this requirement.  

The CRIMSON Clinical Data Management System is predicated on the use of client software that will run in both Macintosh and PC Operating Systems and will produce interfaces with a complexity that XML languages cannot.  Systex has developed and maintained the current system using 4th Dimension, GQL, and Sybase software tools.  Systex has extensive experience with cross-platform development and with the development of the orphaned programs currently in use in CRIMSON, such as, Andyne and GQL.  

In addition, the development of database solutions for clinical care and research documentation and data warehousing requires an in-depth knowledge of clinical practice and research documentation standards as set for by institutional and regulatory authorities, privacy and security standards set to protect patient data, data standards for submission of research findings set by regulatory agencies, and the environment and personnel who do clinical research and care. Systex possesses the required experience with development of clinical research data management systems that meet the unique needs of the NIAID DIR clinical research program.  The experience of Systex is crucial to the management and maintenance of this system. 

The current contract was awarded competitively with only one offeror, Systex, responding.   For this reason, and based on the requirements of the system and expertise of the contractor described above, the Government believes that no other offerors are currently available to provide these services.  Any questions regarding this requirement should be addressed to Terrie Nestor, Contract Specialist, at (301) 402-6790, or tnestor@niaid.nih.gov before the synopsis closing date of October 28, 2002.

Air Force Research Laboratory Rome Research Site (AFRL RRS) is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase AFRL?s knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) of warfighting techniques, equipment and capabilities.  Solutions to basic research and engineering using innovative approaches will be sought.  The scope of this effort primarily concerns the area of the Modeling and Simulation science, as applied to C4ISR and covers a broad range of requirements which include, but are not limited to, improved real-time decision-making, predictive assessments, theoretical foundations of decision science, wargaming and course of action analyses.  AFRL RRS requires solutions sufficient to meet the needs of the Air Force and the national modeling community (Air Force Battle Labs, National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC), Joint Warfare Simulation (JWARS) Program Office, Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS), Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO), Air Force Warfighting Integration (AF/XI), etc.).  Some areas of interest are:  model abstraction techniques, multiresolution M&S, modeling the cognitive process, synthetic environments, optimization approaches, hybrid dynamical systems, natural systems, M&S in distributed mission training, information visualization/animation, qualitative/fuzzy simulation , M&S for wargaming and exercise support, modeling paradigms/methodologies, behavior representation, model interoperability, among others, and involve feasibility studies, functional prototyping, proof-of-concept development/demonstration and specific C4ISR/military applications.  Emphasis is placed on the insertion of technology into ongoing and planned simulation infrastructures and activities.  THIS ANNOUCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a one-sided, 12 point type, single spaced, one inch margined white paper not to exceed five (5) pages with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, women-owned small, or small disadvantaged business or historically black college, university or minority institution.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to AFRL/IFSB, ATTN: Alex F. Sisti, (Reference BAA 02-05-IFKA), 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY, 13441-4505. The white paper will be formatted as follows:  SECTION A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task and Name of Company; SECTION B:  Task Objective and SECTION C:  Technical Summary.  White papers must reference BAA 02-05-IFKA.  Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  White papers addressing different areas of applicability must be submitted under separate cover.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  Offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Complete proposal instructions will be contained in a letter accepting your white paper and requesting a proposal.  Such invitation does not assure the offeror will receive an award.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA.  Evaluation of white papers and solicited proposals will be performed using the following criteria:  (1) Effectiveness in Enhancing Modeling and Simulation for Supporting the Air Force Mission (Soundness of Approach); (2) Relevance to the Air Force Mission; (3) Uniqueness of the Approach, and (4) Cost Realism and Reasonableness.  Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4.  Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA will be used.  The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>M--A-76 cost comparison study of operations at three National Defense Reserve Fleets
<SOLNBR>DTMA1B03001
<ARCHDATE>09272003
<CONTACT>Wayne Leong Contracting Officer 2023665620     wayne.leong@marad.dot.gov;
<DESC>This is a follow-on announcement to a synopsis that MARAD issued on June 28, 2002 and a second announcement on August 13, regarding an A-76 cost comparison study of MARAD's NDRF sites at Suisun Bay near Benicia, Calif., James River near Ft. Eustis, Va; and the Neches River, near Beaumont, Texas. The A-76 study will review the operations at the NDRF sites to determine the least costly and most efficient method of operation.  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities", sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity.  The circular requires Federal agencies to review their commercial activities to determine whether it would be more economical to continue operating them in-house (i.e., with Government employees) or under contract with commercial sources.  The review will be conducted in accordance with Circular A-76 and the revised supplemental handbook.   The June synopsis announced the start of the A-76 cost-comparison study. The August synopsis posted for comment a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The synopsis also indicated that a fleet manual and workload data would be published at a later date that would supplement the PWS.   This synopsis serves to publish the second draft of the PWS, as well as the draft fleet manual and supporting workload data.   Workload data reflect the actual reported workload the three sites for the one-year period, and the section headings in the workload data conform to the numbered sections of the PWS.  Potential offerors will note that the draft PWS identifies the major work objectives and performance standards.  The offeror must then determine how to best accomplish the work objectives to the standards set forth in the PWS.  When evaluating proposals, MARAD will determine whether the proposed approach or process is technically acceptable.  An important future change not reflected in this PWS:  MARAD will revise the PWS to require the contractor to perform grounds maintenance instead of providing it as a government furnished service.  Comments received before Oct 21 will be considered.   MARAD intends to next issue in November for public comments a draft solicitation.  MARAD expects to release the solicitation in early 2003. Submit any comments to acquisitions.marad@marad.dot.gov.

The following information is provided to clarify questions addressed about this solicitation regarding information about the IMPACT Three Plus Assessments.  The Assessments are directly related to the IMPACT (Investigate, Meet, Probe, Apply, Convince, Tie-It-Up) Selling System, which is the system used by Air Force Reserve Recruiters to recruit.  No other Assessment measures performance aptitude as it relates to using the IMPACT Selling System. The information reported by these assessments measures the attitudes, skills, and behaviors of a recruiter as displayed/performed in the recruiting environment.  The Assessment tells us whether or not the recruiter/recruiter applicant has the "right stuff" to employ the IMPACT Selling System.  The Brooks Group is offering us the opportunity to give the assessment to all our recruiters and recruiter applicants over the internet, on an unlimited basis.  The reason some recruiters benefit from annually retaking the assessment is that skills, attitudes, and behaviors change over time.  They may get better or worse, depending on the circumstances of the individual recruiter.  Reassessing recruiters each year means we'll identify those recruiters who are improving versus those who may be going "stale" on us.  Furthermore, for new recruiter applicants, we'll have an excellent idea up front whether or not someone is cut out to become a recruiter.  It's much cheaper not to hire the wrong person than to hire and train the wrong person, only to see them fail.  Our recruiting force is nearly 400 people, plus we interview/hire another 100 or more per year.*****

<DESC>This is a market survey to determine the availability of state of the art mobile transportable storage.  The following Portable Fuel Storage specification is provided to give an in-depth description of services required:  

The Department of Defense requires portable fuel storage systems.  These systems are composed of individual storage containers that must be fully capable of holding and compatible with military and commercial specification fuel without leaking or seeping.  The systems must have the ability to receive and issue fuel simultaneously.  Operating conditions for these systems consists of cold to desert field environment with temperatures ranging from a negative 25 degree Fahrenheit to a positive 150 degree Fahrenheit.  In addition, the containers must have a storage life of 10 years with temperature variables of a negative 30 degree Fahrenheit to a positive 160 degree Fahrenheit.  The system must be capable of holding fuel in the following three categories:

Category I: A highly transportable, very temporary, lightweight individual storage system consisting of one or more containers with a combined storage capacity up to 60,000 US Gallons (USG).

	Operation Concept:  A transportable temporary, lightweight tactical, fuel storage system, consisting of individual fuel storage containers, with the ability to be fully operational within four hours using only four or less personnel and no Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE).  Once establish and fuel is introduced into the system, it should remain operational, without failure, for a minimum of three years.  This temporary fuel storage system will also require the following specifications:

o	Individual storage containers should range nominally from 3,000 through 60,000 USG.
o	Individual storage container?s expected minimum storage life from date of manufacture is 10 years in any type of storage environment.
o	 Storage system should be highly transportable and include shipping dimensions not to exceed those of a TRICON container (6 feet 2 1/16 inch x 7 feet 6 ? inch x 7 feet 5 ? inch (L x W x H)).
o	All water and fuel must have the ability to be easily evacuated from the system.
o	System must be field repairable by field personnel with minimal additional gear.
o	Interoperability with standard 2 ? 4 inches US KAM-LOC connections.

Category II: A transportable, temporary, medium weight individual storage system consisting of one or more containers with a combined storage capacity of 60,000 to 1 million USG.

	Operation Concept:  A temporary, tactical, fuel storage system, consisting of individual fuel storage containers, with the ability to be fully operational within 24 hours using a maximum of eight personnel and a 4,000 lbs. Forklift.  Once established and fuel is introduced into the system, it should remain operational, without failure, for a minimum of three years.  This temporary fuel storage system will also require the following specifications:

o	Individual storage containers should range nominally from 20,000 through 50,000 USG.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) has a requirement for the design and execution of experiments which use CW UV narrowband laser sources for frequency standards based on laser-cooled trapped ions.  The project will investigate the feasibility of simultaneously trapping an ion that has desirable clock features (A1+) with an ion that can be used for cooling and detection of the clock ion's quantum state (Mg+ or Be+).  Specific tasks are as follows: (1) investigate options for generating highly-stable, tunable laser radiation at 267 nm; (2) stabilize frequency of lasers to stable, vibration-isolated optical cavities; (3) design ion trap apparatus for clock and cooling/detection ions; (4) construction of ion trap apparatus; (5) installation of beam switching hardware for laser beams (using acousto-optic modulators); (6) carry out experiments to sympathetically cool clock ions; (7) perform theoretical studies of systematic frequency shifts expected in clock performance.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  Interested sources must submit a written qualification statement with references showing relevant experience that demonstrates previous experience with both CW UV coherent sources and laser cooling of trapped atomic ions.  The award decision will be based on Best Value to the Government with technical merit and past performance being significantly more important than price.  Interested sources must submit a proposal by close of business October 15, 2002.  Proposals submitted must clearly establish the capability to meet the above requirement.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE.  Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date October 18, 2002.  Contracting Officer: Michelle Sandoval.

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is seeking sources to assist in the oversignt, management and technical support of an initiative to develop E-Commerce systems. 

DEA is modifying its regulations to permit the use of Public Key Infrastructure to bring advanntages of Electronic Government and Electronic Commerce to the regulatroy process. This process will allow transactions to be electronically transmitted over the Internet using digital signature technology in lieu of paper processing and written signatures.  This technology will be used in the Controlled Substance Ordering System (CSOS) and Electronics Prescriptions for Controlled Substances (EPCS) Certification Authority.  The CSOS provides manufacturers, distributors,wholesalers, and retailers of controlled substances the option to digitally sign and transmit orders between trading partners, while EPCS provides for the electronic transmission of controlled substance prescriptions from practitioner to pharmacy.

DEA has a requirement for specialized consulting /audting services which will enable the agency to have a fully accredited Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)solution in place by October 2003.

Interested sources should contact Cynthia Miller at 202-307-1780 with information concerning technical capability to provide the required support.

<DESC>SUBJ:  Sources sought for medical/surgical items=20 This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA=92s purchasing of products.=20 BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued at a later date. =20 Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.=20 Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria. =20 NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).=20 THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.

Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.  In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.  If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel  will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) against an FSS contract rather than issuing a formal solicitation for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have  an FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183.  Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples.  If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract. The VHA Medical/Surgical User Group, a group of VA physicians, nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable.=20 **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Item Management Division (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141** =20 SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 23, 2002.

<DESC>SUBJ:  Sources sought for medical/surgical items=20 This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA=92s purchasing of products.=20 BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued at a later date. =20 Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.=20 Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria. =20 NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).=20 THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559.=20 All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer=92s name.=20 Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.  In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.  If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel  will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) against an FSS contract rather than issuing a formal solicitation for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have  an FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183.  Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples.  If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract. The VHA Medical/Surgical User Group, a group of VA physicians, nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable.=20 **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Item Management Division (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141** =20 SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 23, 2002.

<DESC>NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for the Design and Fabrication of High Temperature Seal Preloading Devices.  Do NOT contact the procurement point of contact. Instead contact Pat Dunlap, 216-433-6374, NASA GRC, 21000 Brookpark Road, Mail Stop 23-3, Cleveland Ohio 44135. Fax (216) 433-5170 or e-mail Patrick.Dunlap@grc.nasa.gov. NASA Glenn Research Center is developing high temperature structural seals for future reusable launch vehicles. A major requirement for these seals is that they remain in contact with the opposing sealing surface for many missions while under compression at high temperatures. This means that the seals themselves must be resilient or that there must be a structural element behind the seals that keeps them in contact with the sealing surface. Current state-of-the-art seal designs lose resiliency after exposure to high temperatures while under compression. In an effort to overcome this problem, NASA GRC is developing high temperature seal preloading devices as a potential means of improving seal resiliency. Vendors responding to this solicitation must be able to design and fabricate high temperature seal preloading devices. Canted coil springs, compression springs, wave springs, and linear expanders are candidates for this application, but other types of devices can also be considered. These devices must be able to operate at a temperature range of 2000-3000F in air for 100 to 1000 heating cycles. They should have a deflection, or stroke, of 20-30% of their free height without taking on a permanent set. The anticipated free height is expected to be no more than 0.75 in. Different load ranges are being considered. Example load ranges include 5, 20, and 75 lb per linear inch. Candidate materials include ceramics, ceramic matrix composites, refractory metals, or other materials that can withstand the required operating temperatures and conditions. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.	It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these cites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm,  size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).  Technical questions should be directed to:  Pat Dunlap, at the address or phone numbers listed above. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in Internet "Note A".   This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered  in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted  to Pat Dunlap no later than October 30, 2002. In responding reference grc-5950-02. Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL: http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html

<SUBJECT>R--Occupational and Physical Therapy Services for the Havasupai Elementary School, Supai, Arizona
<DESC>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 13, Subpart 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Department of the Interior, BIA, Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP) intends to contract on a sole source basis the services of Rural Therapy Services; 1124 W. Ardrey Circle; Flagstaff, Arizona  86001 to provide Occupational and Physical Therapy Services for the Havasupai Elementary School.  Havasupai Elementary School is located at the bottom of the Grand Canyon in Supai, Arizona and the location is extremely remote.    The Bureau of Indian Affairs recently took over operation of this school and not only was there an urgent need to provide this service to the students but it was extremely important to cause as little disruption in the lives of  the students receiving this service by continuing to use the previous company to provide this service to the students.   Also, to acquaint and train a new service provider on the background, characteristics, placement, rationale and academic profiles of the students would take months, which would not be beneficial to the students at this time.  Rural Therapy Services has provided services to Havasupai Elementary School for over two years.  The service provider has demonstrated sensitivity to the Havasupai students and their culture.  The provider has knowledge of the physical and occupational needs of those whom she has screened and evaluated.    A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responsible sources may submit a qualifications package and quotation, which, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.  If no affirmative written response is received within 5 calendar days from the publication of this synopsis, a contract may be issued to the proposed contractor without further notice.

We are searching for civilian training and certification/qualification programs that could possibly be aligned with Seabee rate training.  The purpose is to align construction training, certifications and qualifications with civilian practices where practicable, and to take advantage of the best available training to help improve and develop Seabee training/skill levels to industry quality standards.

1. The Builder Rate includes trade titles of Carpenter and Cement Mason.  2. The Construction Electrician Rate includes trade titles of Electric-Motor Repairer, Electrician (Construction), Hydroelectric Machinery Mechanic, Maintenance Mechanic (Telephone), Electrician (Maintenance) and Station Installer.  
3. The Construction Mechanic Rate includes trade titles of Automobile Mechanic, Diesel Mechanic, Hydroelectric Machinery Mechanic and Engineer Equipment Mechanic.  4. The Engineering Aide Rate includes trade titles of Drafter (Architectural), Drafter (Civil) and Surveyor Assistant.  5. The Equipment Operator Rate includes trade titles of Operating Engineer and Heavy Vehicle Operator.  6. The Steelworker Rate includes trade titles of Rigger, Sheet Metal Worker and Welder.  7. The Utilitiesman rate includes trade titles of Pipe Coverer & Insulator, Pipe Fitter, Water Treatment Plant Operator, Refrigeration Mechanic and Plumber.  

If you have training products that meet the above criteria and are related to the construction field, provide a detailed course syllabus that lays out individual tasks/training performed so we can evaluate it against existing training and other sources.  

Additionally, information should answer at a minimum the following questions:

-Who is eligible to participate in the program?
-Is it a training or certification program or both?
-Who recognizes the program?
-How much does the program cost?
-How long in duration is the program?        

Submit all responses to this REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY no later than 31 October 2002 to LCDR Ted Posuniak, Head of Seabee Policy and doctrine by the following methods: (1) E-mail posuniaktt@navfac.navy.mil, (2) FAX (202) 685-1649 or Mail to Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, NAVFAC HQ, Code SRD 1322 Patterson Avenue SE Suite 1000, Washington Navy Yard, DC, 20374, Attn: LCDR Ted Posuniak.

The Government does not intend, at this time, to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided.

<DESC>Development of Web-based Assessments for an
Information Technology Workforce Needs Analysis

	STATEMENT OF WORK

The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Employment Service (ES) is seeking proposals from contractors to perform work associated with development of web-based assessments for an Information Technology Workforce Needs Analysis.

As part of the process, OPM will be providing several assessment tools that can be used in evaluating the agency?s current employees on critical IT competencies. This statement of work specifies the scope of work to develop a web-based assessment tool that measures the critical competencies identified for the analysis. To meet commitments to the client agency, the web-based assessment must be ready for implementation by January 24, 2003. 

The web-based assessment should measure the critical competencies for each of the following IT specialty titles:

-	Policy, Planning, & Management -develop, implement, and ensure compliance with plans, policies, standards, infrastructures, and architectures that establish the framework for the management of all IT programs.
-	Information Systems Security -plan, develop, implement, and maintain programs, policies, and procedures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of systems, networks, and data.
-	Systems Analysis -consult with customers to refine functional requirements and translate functional requirements into technical specifications.
-	Software Engineering, Applications -translate technical specifications into programming specifications; develop, customize, or acquire applications software programs; and test debug, and maintain software programs.
-	Software Engineering, Systems -install, configure, and maintain networks including hardware (servers, hubs, bridges, switches, and routers) and software that permit the sharing and transmission of information.
-	Network Services -test, install, configure, and maintain networks including hardware (servers, hubs, bridges, switches, and routers) and software that permit the sharing and transmission of information. 
-	Data Management -develop and administer databases used to store and retrieve data and develop standards for the handling of data.
-	Internet -provide services that permit the publication and transmission of information about agency programs to internal and external audiences using the Internet.
-	Systems Administration -install, configure, troubleshoot, and maintain hardware and software to ensure the availability and functionality of systems.
-	Customer Support -provide technical support to customers who need advice, assistance, and training in applying hardware and software systems. 

The proposed work can only be done by professional staff who has worked in the area of assessment development.  Typically, these people would be development staff of for-profit and not-for-profit assessment development organizations.  These people must possess psychometric skills that are not generally available.  The professional staff must have extensive experience in developing and administering assessments such as tests via the Internet.

Product and Service Specification

(1) Development of Web-based Measures of Competencies.

The following criteria are used by OPM in preparing items of this type and must be adhered to under this contract. Application of these principles in item specification, writing, and editing would address, directly or indirectly, many of the concerns in the public sector relating to job-relatedness, privacy, individual control, accuracy, and fairness.  

1.	Items should be judged relevant (i.e., discernable to a knowledgeable person) to job performance.

2.  Items need to be compliant with all Section 508 accessibility standards.  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1998 requires that Federal electronic and information technology be accessible to Federal employees with disabilities and requires Federal agencies to provide comparable access to information to both individuals with disabilities and individuals without disabilities.  Further information can be found at http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=12

3.  The tests will need to be administered to approximately 500 employees during a 4 week period starting February 17, 2003 and concluding March 14, 2003.  Vendors should include pricing for administrations of up to 800 employees.

Use of Existing Contractor Items

The contractor may provide proprietary items from its files for this project providing the Federal Government is given authority for the unlimited use of the items, during the analysis process, for Federal use. Further, an item may be used for more than one dimension providing that a sound rationale is provided for that use.

(2) Automate and Secure Assessments, Database, Interfaces and Access Platforms.
 
The assessments must be secure, web-based and completely automated. Data must be collected using the Internet.  The data to be collected will include the employee?s name, social security number, citizenship, and test scores. Employees who attempt to take the tests more than once should be blocked from accessing the tests after one administration. The data for all employees will be transmitted to a site designated by OPM via an HTTPS post after each administration in real time.  OPM will send an acknowledgement to let the vendor know that each employee record was successfully received.  The vendor will retransmit with acknowledgement if not received, and will cooperate with OPM in the reconciliation of failed transmissions.  The vendor must also provide an automated control to prevent an employee from taking a test more than one time.

The vendor will provide some form of notice to the employee, which can be printed in hard copy and retained by the employee, as a confirmation when, and only when, he or she has taken all required tests.  The notice will include a unique confirmation number that can be used for tracking and reconciliation purposes.

At the end of the Period of Performance, the vendor will provide a file containing all employees.  The file should be in the format of a Microsoft Excel file, or a Microsoft Excel-like format that is suitable for statistical analysis.  The vendor needs to retain information for each employee that includes every question asked and every response given by the employee.  (If the vendor uses a numbering system to catalog questions, and can make available the catalog of the questions, it will suffice for the employee record to contain the question ID number and the response instead of the actual question.)

Further, the web-based assessment must be transparently interfaced with an OPM or client agency website. The interface must represent an OPM product.This will ensure continuity and enable a smoother data transition within the project. The vendor may be noted as the web site contractor, following the above standards are met; however, the web-site must have the look and feel of an OPM site. OPM can provide agency-specific graphics and logos to the vendor.

3) Documentation of Quality of the Assessments

The contractor must provide detailed documentation of the appropriateness and quality of the assessment tool, including supporting evidence of the validity and reliability of the assessments. 

4) Documentation of Correspondence between Contractor Assessments and OPM Competencies

The contractor should provide detailed documentation demonstrating the correspondence between the contractor?s assessments and OPM?s IT competencies.  

5) Evaluation of Products Produced

The contractor will submit a timeline for the work products to ensure that the work is completed in a timely manner.  Once the statement of work and timelines, with quality indicators, is agreed to, the contract may be stopped at anytime if the work has not been completed as specified in these documents.

Criteria for Evaluation of Contractors

The Government intends to award a firm, fixed-price purchase order for the services specified in the Statement of Work (SOW) to a source that will be of the best value to the Government, considering primarily technical excellence with price and other factors considered.  The company offering the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher priced proposal is deemed of better quality by OPM.  The determination will be made by comparing the difference in value of technical features with differences in each offeror?s price.  Subjective judgment on the part of the Government is implicit throughout the entire process if source selection.

In making the best value comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior performance than price.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve only slightly superior performance capabilities and services.  The Government will make this assessment through the development of trade-off analyses, and other analytic studies as necessary, that involve the assessment of benefits of superior performance capability and services versus added price.  Price may become the ultimate determining factor for award of a contract as proposals become technically equal.  

The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.

Proposals will be evaluated against, and should address the following requirements as further detailed in the SOW (from most important to least important factor):

-	Overall approach and methodology for accomplishing the work

o	Psychometric properties of assessments
o	Correspondence between assessments and IT competencies
o	User Interface
o	Data Security
o	Database (format, physical location, database software used)
-	Qualifications of contractor personnel

Provide a resume for each staff member who will be assigned to this project; identifying, at a minimum their educational background and work experience, identifying prior specific projects of a nature similar to this one.  If the offer intends to use any subcontractors, the offer should provide this same information for each potential subcontractor.

-	Past performance on similar projects.

	Offers should provide a list of all prior projects of a similar scope and magnitude to this project.  This list should identify the name of the entity for which the work was performed, the contract number if applicable (or other method of identification), the date of performance, and a short description of the nature of the project.  Additionally, for 3 to 5 of these prior projects, provide the name of a reference that can address contract performance.  For each listed reference, include a current telephone number and address.  Actual work samples or websites that the vendor has developed should be provided. 
 
-	Managerial and administrative considerations.

Provide a milestone chart which:
Contains specific dates to complete each phase of the technical requirements;
Contains delivery dates for interim and final products.

-	Managerial and administrative considerations.

The following 1052.204-72 (Treasury Dept.) clause applies to this solicitation:  REQUIRED CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (JAN 2002) The United States Department of the Treasury has adopted the Department of Defense?s Central Contractor Registration database as its database for contractor information.  (This clause does not apply to the Treasury Bureau known as the Comptroller of the Currency.)  Accordingly, the following requirements apply to this contract. (a) Definitions.  As used in this clause -- (1) ?Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database? means the primary Department of Defense (DoD) repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DoD. (2) ?Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number? means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) ?Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number? means the DUNS number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern.  This 4-digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying sub-units or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) ?Registered in the CCR database? means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4, if applicable, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number has been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that it must be registered in the CCR database prior to contract award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. (2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS+4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (3) Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award of a Treasury contract. (4) DoD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet.  However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days.  Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c)The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data.  To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete. (d) Following the Contractor?s initial registration in CCR and receipt of any Treasury Department (excluding the Comptroller of the Currency) award of a contract, purchase order, delivery order, task order, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement, the Contractor must directly notify the Contracting Officer of any of its changed mandatory business data in CCR within three business days of the change.  (See the CCR Handbook at www.ccr.gov for the current mandatory registration data fields, or contact the CCR Assistance Center at 888-227-2423 or 616-961-4725.)Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov, from the Defense Electronic Business Program Office (Defense e-Business) at contact.ccr@us.pwcglobal.com, from the CCR Assistance Center at 888-227-2423 or 616-961-4725, from the Defense Logistic Information Service at dlis_support@dlis.dla.mil. Contractors such as some consultants and sole proprietorships that are small firms that would otherwise have no use for a Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) number, may use an alternative D&B registration method.  If needing a D&B number principally for CCR registration, such a Contractor should call D&B toll-free at 800-333-0505, and clearly state that it is a very small business and simply needs a DUNS number for the purpose of CCR registration.  At a minimum, responsible sources should provide this office: a price proposal on letterhead that should show the requested items; with their unit prices, extended prices, total price, prompt payment terms, warranty, shipping prices, remittance address, Tax I.D. #, Duns #, and Cage Code.  Responses to this solicitation are due by AUGUST 30, 2002 at 1600 (4:00 p.m.).  Quotes can be faxed to (415) 848-4711 Attn: Christine Matschkowsky, e-mailed to Christine.Matschkowsky@irs.gov, or mailed to: Internal Revenue Service, Procurement Operations Branch, Western Area, 333 Market Street, Suite 1400, Attn: Christine Matschkowsky, San Francisco, CA 94105.
