This announcement constitutes the solicitation. The Bureau of Reclamation, Grand Coulee Power Office, Grand Coulee WA has a requirement for SF6 gas compressors and blast valves.  This is a small business set-aside requirement. The NAICS Code is 333912 and the size standard is 500 employees. Delivery is to be made to the Bureau of Reclamation, Warehouse B - Door 6 - Industrial Area, Grand Coulee WA 99133. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) is being issued as 04SQ1700814 and quotes (including product specification literature and completed 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items) are due June 15, 2004. The RFQ incorporates revisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2001-22. The Government anticipates an award of a firm-fixed price resulting from this RFQ on or about June 16, 2004.  Following are the applicable provisions and contract clauses incorporated by reference:  FAR 52.212-1 Dated January 2004 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3 Dated January 2004 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Dated October 2003 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial items; FAR 52.212-5 Dated January 2004 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph b is edited to incorporate the following clauses: 52.222-3 Convict Labor, 52.222-19 Child Labor-Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52-222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other Eligible Veterans, 52.225-1 Buy American Act-Supplies, 52-225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration.  CLIN 0001: COMPRESSOR, SF6 gas, two-cylinder, reciprocating compressor designed for gas.  Cylinders and cylinder heads are identical.  Disc-type suction and discharge valves are used in the cylinder heads.  Precision ground, hardened-steel wrist pins attach the pistons to the connecting rods.  A rotary sliding vane type oil pump supplies oil to moving parts of the compressor.  The crankshaft and flywheel are balanced to provide for smooth operation.  The combination flywheel is used as a drive pulley and a cooling fan.  A spring actuated rotary oil seal proves a positive seal at the crankshaft-flywheel end.  O-rings and gaskets are used to form a gas tight seal at the valves, cylinder heads, and cylinders.  An oil level sight gage is located in the side of the crankcase to observe oil level.  Summit Electric Part No. 2063C39H01, or equal.  Specify warranty.  Quantity 2 each. CLIN 002:  BLAST  VALVE, 4 PORT, remanufactured. The blast valve piston located in the end of the high pressure reservoir controls the flow of gas from the reservoir to the interrupting units.  The sliding valve design minimizes the forces due to gas pressure tending to hold the valve in the closed position.   The flow of gas from the auxiliary reservoir to the interrupter unit is sealed by a Teflon seal ring and the rounded lip on the piston bearing against a valve seat.  A bumper of reinforced laminated rubber absorbs the energy of the piston as it nears the end of its open position travel.  Summit Electric Part No. 5605D55G04R, or equal. Specify warranty.  Quantity 6 each.  CLIN 003:  TRADE IN of the old blast valve of a Westinghouse 550 SFA Breaker S/N 2-62Y5529.

<SUBJECT>R -- Integration of the GMDN and the UMDNS device nomenclature systems into the CDRH product code classification
<SOLNBR>223-04-6051
<RESPDATE>060604
<ARCHDATE>06212004
<CONTACT>Hamilton Brown, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 827-7043, Fax (301) 827-7101, Email hbrown@oc.fda.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) to award a contract on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) to ECRI, 5200 Butler Pike, Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462-1298. 

CDRH has determined that it is necessary to adopt the Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN) into its current product nomenclature system and to harmonize the Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System (UMDNS), GMDN, and CDRH device classification systems. The GMDN is a system of names, definitions, and codes for medical device products. The UMDNS is also a terminology system for medical devices used internationally. In addition, the U.S. National Library of Medicine incorporates the UMDNS into its Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Integrating both the GMDN and the UMDNS systems into the CDRH product classification will provide device naming conventions, definitions and terms for currently marketed devices (real world), dedicated maintenance resources, a thesaurus, and device nomenclature harmonization with key nations

The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS), a public advisory body to the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the area of health data and statistics, expressed the need for commitment to the concept of one truly international medical device nomenclature system to Secretary Thompson in January 2004.

In order to meet the recommendation of the NCVHS to the Department, CDRH needs to immediately start working on the mapping of the three data structures. The UMDNS and GMDN system each have about 6,700 concepts and over 17,000 terms, organized in a hierarchical structure.  In order to map the large number of concepts and terms in the desired timeframe, it is mandatory that the organization responsible for the mapping have an in-depth understanding of how an international device nomenclature is developed and functions.  To FDA’s knowledge, ECRI (formerly the Emergency Care Research Institute) is the only company that has developed and maintains a medical device nomenclature that is used internationally.  That type of experience is required for the work that FDA needs to accomplish. Device nomenclature is significantly different from other health nomenclatures such as the one used for drugs.  ECRI is the U.S. based non-profit health services research agency that developed and maintains the UMDNS system. UMDNS is a standard international nomenclature for medical devices and has been officially adopted by many nations, as well as by the entire European Union (EU). It is used regularly by thousands of healthcare institutions worldwide and the U.S. National Library of Medicine also incorporates UMDNS into its Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).

ECRI is also the only group that has an intimate knowledge of all three nomenclature systems, the UMDNS, GMDN and FDA structures.  ECRI has many years of experience specifically with these device nomenclatures. The GMDN system is based in large part on an early version of the UMDNS. ECRI has been working with FDA for a number of years and agreed in 1997 to harmonize both UMDNS and FDA's device classification system.  A history of input into the development and a good understanding of the three different nomenclatures is a  prerequisite to the effective and efficient mapping and consolidation  of the different systems. In addition, because of ECRI’s extensive work in identifying, processing, filing, storing, retrieving, transferring, and communicating data about medical devices they are the solitary source of information regarding the development of international nomenclature business rules which will be needed to continue the development of new nomenclature.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with ECRI as the only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ). Sources interested in this requirement must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received at hbrown@oc.fda.gov within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information.  All responses received in a timely manner will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a sole source purchase order to the Urban Land Institute (ULI) to conduct a study entitled, “The Role of Transportation in Location Decision Making.”  This effort will develop a document describing how the transportation system influences land development and location choice processes.  This documentation will provide background for decisions made in the development of long-range transportation plans and in decisions related to the project development process.  Through its Advisory Services Program, ULI assembles teams of real estate planning; development, and financing experts who volunteer their time to provide objective advice on addressing challenging land use issues.  It is ULI’s ability to draw on the expertise of its more than 20,000 members with extensive experience and expertise in land planning and development that makes the Advisory Services Program a unique process that is not replicated by any other organization.  Therefore, ULI is the only known source that can provide the required service.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about June 15, 2004.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for one (1) each MultiScan 600CW MSC Camera, Gatan FireWire Product Adapter, and Microscopy Suite (Digital/Micrograph), including installation and basic operator training. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Gatan, Inc., 5933 Coronada Lane, Pleasanton, CA 94588, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  Because adequate information was not available, market research was conducted in accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(2)(iii).	The market research disclosed three comparable TEM digital camera systems with charge couple device (CCD) arrays greater than or equal to 1024 by 1024 pixels from different manufacturers.  The systems were evaluated to determine suitability for use with the Japanese Electron Optics Laboratory (JEOL) 2000 FXII TEM currently being used by MSFC.	Because of the varied nature of materials analyzed at MSFC and the different modes of imaging in a TEM, the most suitable TEM camera must be equally efficient at creating and differentiating contrast in bright field images, dark field images, and electron diffraction patterns.  The ability to differentiate contrast from pixel to pixel defines the point-to-point resolution of the acquired digital image.  The contrast in a collected CCD image is affected through three main parameters:  optic coupling, dynamic range, and CCD pixel size.  2.  The optimum TEM CCD camera for MSFC applications was found to require the following features:  (1)	fiber optic CCD coupling for the most efficient signal transfer to the CCD which allows for a	better image collection and prevents bleeding in high intensity diffraction patterns; (2) a large CCD pixel size of 24 microns or greater for a high signal collection capacity which prevents over-saturation of the CCD and washed out images with little detail; and (3) a high dynamic range of 14 bits or greater for the best contrast differentiation, which greatly enhances contrast and clarity. 3.  Only Gatan Inc., the sole manufacturer and distributor of the MultiScan 600CW, met all these technical conditions.  The other companies analyzed provided only either lens-coupled CCD cameras with small pixel sizes that will lead to poor contrast in low intensity samples and cause bleeding problems in diffraction patterns or fiber-optic coupled cameras, with small CCD pixel size and dynamic range, which will lead to lower contrast differentiation in electron diffraction patterns.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 06/08/2004.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Description: SUBJECT: Design, fabricate, and test the Counter Rotating  Tandem Motor composed of a pilot bit and a reamer w/stabilizer. DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Dennis Tool Company, Houston, TX for the following work to be completed at our site U.S. Department of Energy, Albany Research Center, Albany, Or. STATEMENT OF WORK:  ?Counter Rotating Tandem Motor Project? PROJECT OBJECTIVE:  The objective for this project is to design, fabricate, and field test a special drilling tool known as the Counter Rotating Tandem Motor for use by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) as part of the microhole drilling assembly during the Microhole field test (Lab AC1005 BPB202) at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) in Wyoming during the 2004 fiscal year. TASK #1.  BUILD TOOL.  A dual drilling assembly, referred to as the Counter Rotating Tandem Motor will be designed and fabricated by the Dennis Tool Company for use in the LANL Microhole field test in 2004.  The counter rotating tandem motor tool includes a left hand turning motor and pilot bit in tandem with a right hand turning motor and a reamer with stabilizer.  The tools will be tested in the laboratory for basic quality control standards. TASK #2.  FIELD TEST OF THE COUNTER ROTATING TANDEM MOTOR SYSTEM.  The completed system will be transported to RMOTC for use in the LANL Microhole field test for 2004.  Dennis Tool Company will provide supervision during the field testing. TASK #3.  FINAL DEBRIEF AND REPORT TO DOE.  A debrief of DOE will be provided at the end of the field testing.  This can be either an oral debrief in the DOE Tulsa offices or via telephone.  A final report will delivered to the DOE project manager. DEVELOPMENT SEQUENCE.  (1)  Tool Design - *Left-hand 1-7/16? Positive Displacement Motor (PDM); *Left-hand Bit; * Reamer; and *Stabilizer. (2) Fabrication of system.  (3)  Laboratory Tool Quality Control Testing.  (4) Field Performance Testing and Supervision.  (5)  Final debrief and report. (6)  Deliverables:  (a)  Counter Rotating Tandem Motor System; (b) Field Supervision of the tool testing; (c) Final Debrief to DOE, including a final report on the construction and performance of the tool. REQUIREMENT.  This utility of the new tool will be demonstrated in use during the 2004 field test at the RMOTC.  The dual cutter assembly should result in a high drilling rate with low weight on bit in addition to reduced torque, matching the limited capabilities available on the LANL micorhole drilling rig.  The drilling assembly will follow on DOE work in the original tandem motor project (both motors turning in a right hand direction), as well as microwave processing and the previous GRI/DTC work in larger ?log torque? drilling systems. This purchase order is being issued the Dennis Tool Company because of the previous work with the DOE program at Penn State for microwave processing in the fabrication of tools.  They are the only company using superior materials made from microwave processing of the drill bit cutters.  Their previous experience and development work will greatly reduce the cost of the prototype drilling assembly that builds on their unique design that is proved but not commercialized.  The design uses a pilot bit with a reamer and stabilizer using small, super performance PDC cutters.  It is expected that the expertise and unique capabilities will reduce the time required for production of the tandem motor suitable for the microhole drill rig. A nsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.  Therefore, no solicitation will result the announcement. This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770. The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Ms. Helen Weyland ? 918-699-2019.

This will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source selection procedures are identified in FAR Part 15.3, and will incorporate the tradeoff process identified in FAR 15.101-1. This method will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, including the past performance of their subcontractors, qualified/experienced personnel and on their price proposals. All proposals are required to address each of the qualifications. Omission of any of the criteria may render the proposal nonresponsive, preventing the opportunity to submit a price proposal and gain further consideration for award.  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors will be considered equal to cost. The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are as follows: 1) Past Performance and Experience on Similar Projects.  To be considered under Past Performance: elevator installer, elevator maintenance, elevator modernization experience, control systems manufacturer.

Offerors should provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions. The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror's past performance. 2) Proposed Project Team, Key Subcontractors, and Key Personnel.  Approval of an elevator subcontractor, or elevator contractor, is required. To be considered, contractor shall have upgraded within the last eight years, three elevator systems that are comparable to those to be worked on for this project; i.e., electric elevators of three or more cars in one group that serve at least seven or more landings in an office/commercial type building.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), in support of the Program Executive Office for Littoral and Mine Warfare, PMS 420 and PMS 485, is soliciting proposals to explore multiple mechanical/ocean engineering concepts for automated deployment, recover and operation of linear, towed arrays of hydrophones and vertical arrays of acoustic sources from small craft (e.g., 11 m Rigid Hull Inflactable Boat (RHIB)), on the littoral ocean bottom, and from high-speed, non-dedicated surface ships.  Different military ships can be considered by Surveillance Towed Array (SURTASS) Ships or the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) or small boats launched from LCS are of most interet to the Navy.  The areas of interet include: (1) compact, low frequency acoustic source arrays; (2) small lightweight towed receive arrays; (3) deployment and retrieval mechanisms; (4) innovative packaging; (5) power electronics (amplifiers, energy storage); (6) power systems for the lightweight towed arrays, including slow speed propulsion systems; and (7) various material storage and handling systems, and the associated control systems. SSC San Diego in support of the Program Executive Office for Littoral and Mine Warfare, PMS 420 and PMS 485, is similarly soliciting proposals to explore use of a small surface craft to deploy and operate undersea acoustic sensors. The challenges presented by undersea threats provide the impetus for the development of deployable and off-board acoustic surveillance systems which are networked, distributed, and multistatic-capable, such as Advanced Development System (ADS), Fixed Distrituted System (FDS), and Deployable Autonomous Distributed Systems (DADS).  The very low noise levels associated with modern submarines are a significant challenge for passive systems and a natural augmentation of such systems is the addition of an acoustic source.  In addition to working with the deployed systems, the active signals from such sources could also be received and processed by surface craft with towed receive arrays.  In this context an active system has the potential for significant improvement in coverage against a quiet target over a purely passive system.  an Additional benefit for acoustic sources deployed from small craft or unmanned surface vessels (USV) is that this eliminates the vulnerability associated with operating an acoustic source from a large vessel (beaconing).  Operation from a small craft pose several challenges including: (1) dynamics of a small craft from the standpoints of deployment and recovery of a low frequency active array or towed receive array; (2) shock and vibration effects assoicated with high speed transit of small craft; (3) energy storage and management; (4) high efficiency, high power density amplifiers and transduceers; and (5) power plant sizing to maximize mission performance. This notice consititues a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as comtemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016.  Awards may take the form of procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transaction agreements, as appropriate.  Awards as a result of this announcement will depend on the technical evaluations and availability of funds.  The award decision will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a peer and/or scientific review.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. The Government may also only select specific tasks within a proposal for award. No additional written information is available, nor will a request for proposal (RFP), solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity be made.  It is estimated that three awards may be made as a result of this announcement with approximate ceiling amounts of $1,000,000 each.  Proposals are sought now for award and work of efforts in late FY04 and FY05. Contractors are invited to submit cost and technical proposals for one or more of the above areas.  Proposals are due no later than 15:00 Pacific Daylight Saving Time on 20 May 2005; however, those proposals which are received by 15:00 Pacific Daylight Saving Time on 30 June 2004 will have the greatest chance of being funded.   Proposals much be submitted electronically to the SPAWAR e-Commerce Central web site at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. Click on "SSC San Diego" and then "Open BAA."  Additoinal submission instructions are availalbe at the web site under "Submitting a Proposal?" The techncial proposal shall not exceed twenty (20) pages in length, signle-sided on 8 1/2 by 11-inch paper.  The technical proposal shall include a description of the system and subsystem concept development, any proposed non-developmental prototype equipment that may be evaluated and emonstrated by the Navy and interaction required with the Navy to discuss concept development and any candidate non-developmental prototype equipment.  The technical proposal shall clearly identify any data, information or software deliverables that would be provided to the Government with other than unlimited rights. The cost proposal shall contain a summary cost breakdown and a detailed cost breakdown.  The summary cost breakdown should be shown to the level of major tasks and should indicate manpower levels of effort, equipment and supplies, travel, and miscellaneous expenses for the tasks of the entire program, broken out by performer and time.  Details of any cost sharing to be undertaken by the offeror (if applicable) must be included.  The detailed cost breakdown must be supported by back-up documentation sufficient to support the costs.  The detailed cost breakdown shall be prepared in general accordance with Table 15-2 of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.408 with all supporting data in order to allow for a complete review by the Government.  There is no page limitation for the cost proposal. The proposals will be evaluated using the follwoing criteria, which are of equal importance: (1) potential contribution to the mission of the SURTASS and/or LCS programs to increase program responsiveness, efficiency, and effectiveness; (2) overall scientific and technical merit, validity or approach, and probability of successfully demonstrating the proposed technology; (3) realism of the proposed cost and availability of funds; (4) potential for economical integration (positive return on investment) into existing and future Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) operatinos; and (5) interest by NAVSEA components in fielding successful concepts. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal.  historically Black Colleges and Universitites (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas or reaseach for exclusive competition among these entities.  SSC San Diego provies no funding for direct reimbursement of propsoal development costs.  Information and material submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  Questions of a contractual or technical nature should be directed to Ms. Eleanor Kerbs, SSC San Diego Code 225, via e-mail: eleanor.kerbs@navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to serve as the Coordinating Center for the National Children’s Study (NCS-CC).  Background information on the NCS is available at www.nationalchildrensStudy.gov.  The National Children’s Study is a longitudinal cohort study that intends to examine the effects of environmental influences on the health and development of approximately 100,000 U.S. children. The environment is broadly defined to include biological, physical, chemical, and social/cultural influences on children’s health and development.  Priority outcomes are expected to include obesity, diabetes, and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; child development and mental health.  Study participants will be followed from before birth until at least 21 years of age.  The goal of the Study is to gain information leading to improvement in the health and well being of children.  A leading strategy for enrollment of Study participants is to recruit through approximately 30-50 sites across the country.  The Government intends to directly award competitive contracts to each of the 30-50 field sites, with a separate contract award for the Coordinating Center.  Approximately five field sites will be selected to serve as initial or Vanguard sites (to be identified through a separate solicitation).  More sites will be added after protocol pilot testing and as funding becomes available.  The role of the NCS-CC will be to: assist the NICHD NCS Program Office in completing initial planning for the Study by carrying out methods development and feasibility studies, including testing of the full Study protocol at the Vanguard sites; provide statistical expertise to aid in the identification of the additional Study sites and characterization of participants within each Study site; implement the full Study protocol including drafting the NCS Manual of Operations and coordinating the Study sites, laboratory services, repository(ies), and Information Technology (IT) support; provide data management support, statistical analyses, and reporting services, as needed.  The NCS-CC must also have the ability to maintain and augment the nationwide network of field sites should the need arise for establishing new field sites to supplement recruitment of specific subgroups or follow-up of study subjects that relocate out of the established network.  Therefore, the NCS-CC must meet all requirements of the field sites as outlined in the Sources Sought Announcement for the Initial/Vanguard sites (see FedBizOpps announcement at  http://www.eps.gov/spg/HHS/NIH/NICHD/SS%2DNICHD%2D2004%2D07/listing.html   

To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate the ability to: 1) organize, conduct, and manage large multi-site longitudinal studies involving the collection of interview, biologic, clinical, and environmental data.  Include evidence of the ability to develop a detailed Manual of Operating Procedures specifying procedures for participant enrollment, retention, confidentiality and ethics, plus data and sample collection, testing, management, transportation and storage; 2) organize, conduct, and manage a range of methods development and pilot studies, including pilot testing of the full NCS protocol at the Vanguard sites (however, not all methods development studies will utilize the Vanguard sites); 3) assist the NCS sites in designation and recruitment of Study participants; 4) demonstrate statistical expertise to assist the NCS Program Office in identifying additional Study sites and participants following selection of the Vanguard sites; 5) assist the Program Office and Study sites in preparation of materials to be submitted for required reports and clearances e.g. reviews and clearances  by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), application(s) for Certificates of Confidentiality, etc; 6) assist Study sites in gaining community support and input to optimize subject recruitment, retention and dissemination of Study findings and coordinate national public outreach; 7) track Study participants throughout the course of the NCS, including assisting sites in their participant retention efforts, as needed, and in tracking participants when they move from their original Study site; 8) schedule the collection of interview data and biologic, clinical, and environmental samples; cataloguing and tracking the data and samples from sites to the Coordinating Center, laboratories, or repository(ies); linking the data and results to the appropriate individuals; and identifying missing data components for individual participants; 9) develop, maintain and provide the resources for the information systems needed to support such a large multi-site Study, including management of data from disparate sources described above, and potential data management issues associated with the collection and analysis of genetic data; 10) monitor the quality of data collection, editing, auditing, entry and analysis, including a plan for monitoring potential adverse events among Study participants; 11) develop and implement quality control procedures, including adherence to good clinical and laboratory practices, site audits, in-house data audits, and database validation, audits of field data collection procedures including accompanying field data collectors for a sample of visits; 12) train and certify data collectors in each of the Study sites; 13) provide evidence of having qualified and experienced personnel to establish working relationships with Study sites (Vanguard and subsequent), central laboratories, and the Study repository(ies)  and oversee all aspects of the Study; 14) prepare data for statistical analyses, as needed; 15) conduct statistical analyses and provide results of these analyses to Study investigators, as needed; 16) develop and distribute public use and restricted access datasets; and, 17) participate in the preparation of scientific articles and reports summarizing results of the Study.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to add another site visit and to address questions as follows:

1.	A second site visit will take place 10 June 2004 at 0900 at 6500 B Street, Suite 101 Beale AFB, CA.  Please send the names, no greater than three, of the personnel wishing to attend this site visit via e-mail to nikole.may@beale.af.mil.
 
2.	Questions and Answers:

a.	Question:  The SOW provided indicates in paragraph 2.1 that “This includes location and replacement of end of line devices for those circuits with class B configuration.” While paragraph 4.8 implies that the system must be class A.  To our knowledge, the existing system is not class A and to make it such would require virtually complete replacement of the existing system.  If that is the intent, then there is not enough information (floor plans, building construction details etc.) to assess the cost involved.

Answer:  Paragraph 4.8 of the Statement of Work is now replaced with the following verbiage: “Provide new addressable monitor and control modules to connect to the existing approximately 22 Class A initiating device circuits (IDCs), up to 24 Class B IDCs, up to 12 Class B notification appliance circuits (NACs), and up to 4 supervised air handler shutdown circuits.  New modules to be installed in the existing Monaco enclosure.”

b.	Question:  There is no mention in the SOW the “new” portion of the system installed or being installed by another contractor.  Since it is in the same building, it is unclear if there is any responsibility under this SOW for this part of the system.

Answer:  The contractor will be responsible for their own work to include programming and installation.

c.	Question:  If the intent of the SOW is repair of the existing system in its current configuration, there is no way to assess the cost involved without a significant amount of technical data indicating the extent of the existing system including device types, locations and quantities, wiring configuration, conduit layout, air handler location and quantity, and other such details required to determine the cost involved.

Answer:  The purpose of the site visit is to gather information and assess system configuration details not provided in the Statement of Work.

<DESC>Description: NAICS 238290 Size Standard: $12.0 Million. Solicitation No. GS-01P-04-NLC-0037 Elevator Modernization at the A. A. Ribicoff FB, Hartford, CT. The estimated construction cost range is $1 million to $5 million. In accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, this procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns. The estimated period of performance is 18 months. This procurement is for a firm to provide all management, labor, materials, and equipment necessary for the modernization of five passenger elevators as follows; modernize four gearless elevators (#1 thru #4); modernize one geared service elevator (#6). Elevator #5 shall not be modernized under the base contract, but if exercised under Option 1, shall be removed out of service. Alternate 1 will be identified to replace the cabs on elevators #1 thru #4. The modernization will require maintenance servicing for existing and renovated elevators and associated equipment from Notice to Proceed until all elevators are accepted for beneficial use. The work shall be conducted to accommodate continued occupancy of the building. The contractor’s personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project. This will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source selection procedures are identified in FAR Part 15.3, and will incorporate the tradeoff process identified in FAR 15.101-1. This method will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, including the past performance of their subcontractors, qualified/experienced personnel and on their price proposals. All proposals are required to address each of the qualifications. Omission of any of the criteria may render the proposal nonresponsive, preventing the opportunity to submit a price proposal and gain further consideration for award.  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors will be considered equal to cost. The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are as follows: 1) Past Performance and Experience on Similar Projects.  To be considered under Past Performance: elevator installer, elevator maintenance, elevator modernization experience, control systems manufacturer.  To be considered under Past Experience:  previous client assessment of offeror's performance, project completion on time and within budget, and tenant impact.  Regarding past performance offerors with no relevant performance history shall provide information, which helps to identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to the requirement as identified in the attached Statement of Work. Offerors should provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions. The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror's past performance. 2) Proposed Project Team, Key Subcontractors, and Key Personnel.  Approval of an elevator subcontractor, or elevator contractor, is required. To be considered, contractor shall have upgraded within the last eight years, three elevator systems that are comparable to those to be worked on for this project; i.e., electric elevators of three or more cars in one group that serve at least seven or more landings in an office/commercial type building. Complete list of these installations with names, addresses and telephone numbers of the relevant POC, is required. 
Key personnel shall have at least five years experience including extensive experience in microprocessor-based control systems and installation of non-proprietary control equipment.  Complete information on personnel including project supervisor’s resume(s) for day-to-day operations (installation) and for maintenance oversight are required. 3) Proposed Project Scheduling and Phasing of Construction, and the proposed Elevator Maintenance Plan. 4) Major Equipment Being Offered.  5) Elevator Maintenance Firm Proximity to Project Location.  6) Subcontracting Plan: Public Law 95-507 requires large businesses to provide a subcontracting plan setting forth percentage goals for utilizing small business concerns including, separately identified goals for disadvantaged small business and women-owned small business.  In addition, the prime contractor must describe the efforts it will take to assure that such firms have an equitable opportunity to compete for subcontracts.  Offeror shall address how it will comply with the requirements of FAR 19.704.
The solicitation will be issued at www.fedbizopps.gov March 26, 2004.  In order to obtain plans and specifications, offeror’s must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website. To register, go to www.ccr.gov.  One of the Partner Programs in the ccr website is FedTeDs. In order to obtain specifications and drawings for this solicitation, you must register in FedTeDs. The registration process that FedTeDs utilizes requires each Vendor/Contractor provide an MPIN for their company in their CCR registration. The MPIN is a personal code. Your CCR POC is the only person with access to your company’s active registration. It is the contractor's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any information or documents in the special notices, the solicitation and amendments, if any. A pre-proposal meeting is tentatively scheduled for March 31, 2004. The proposal due date will be OOA April 23, 2004.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the notice below is to re-release tech data package on FedTeDS.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)
				2100 Second Street, SW
				Washington, D.C. 20593
				Telephone:   (202) 267-2285
				 FAX:        (202) 267-4011.
The Request for Proposal number is HSCG89-04-R-6F9007 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 481212.  The small business sized standard is 1,500 employees.  The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.  The Government proposes to solicit offers for the following services and quantities:

CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBER (CLIN): CLIN 0001 Propane refueling-Two sites; Total Quantity 3,400 gallons.  The locations are: 1) Naked Island, 2,300 gallons; 2) Point Pigot, 1,100 gallons.  CLIN 0002 Propane refueling-Seven sites; Total Quantity 6,800 gallons. The locations are: 1) Robert Barron, 2,200 gallons; 2) Duke Island, 800 gallons; 3) Sukkwan Island, 800 gallons; 4) Cape Fanshaw, 700 gallons; 5) Zarembo Island, 700 gallons; 6) Mt. Mac Arther, 700 gallons; 7) Althorp Peak, 900 gallons.
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  The Contractor shall re-fuel two Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Valdez area and seven Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Juneau area.  The National Voice Distress System Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter.  There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites usually includes the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  Normally full pickle barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the mountaintop by a helicopter rated for that load carrying capacity.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane to the permanent site-standard (five) 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity.  The contractor shall provide for all services, materials and equipment, personnel, transportation and propane. Contractor shall record and document actual gallons of propane delivered to each site and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to the Contracting Officer within one week of work completion.
START OF WORK:  Work shall not start before 1 August 2004.
DELIVERY: Services shall be completed for all sites, except Robert Barron, not later than 30 September 2004.  The Robert Barron site shall be refueled no later than 30 August 2004. 
AWARD:  This purchase will be based on the following criteria:  Past performance and technical capability will be evaluated.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The failure to provide requested data, or providing a point of contact that is inaccessible or without a valid phone number, could result in a firm being considered less qualified.  The evaluation of past performance will consider whether the firm has consistently demonstrated quality work, including the team’s record of recommending innovative approaches and/or technologies; adherence to schedules; and history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction.  A proposal that has no record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available, shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  The following elements may result in a firm being considered to have higher qualifications during the evaluation and should be addressed accordingly when preparing each of the criteria responses:  a) Projects completed within the last five (5) years; b) projects directly related to a wide range of waterfront and marine facilities, but with an emphasis on marine facilities (piers, dry-docks, etc.), and industrial waterfront shops and facilities; c) projects with an estimated construction cost of $100,000 to $10M; d) projects involving a sustainable design approach; and e) design-build projects.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

Request for Information for a Standardized Database Solution for Converting Microsoft Access Databases 

 
1.0	SUBJECT

Request for Information (RFI) for a two phased solution to convert, store, manipulate and report data located in multiple databases/spreadsheets (Microsoft Access, Excel, etc.) into a standardized database, and report data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders to be integrated with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Operating Platform located at the data hosting center in St. Louis, Missouri.  The database will support users from multiple departments within TSA. Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on June 4, 2004.  See section 8.0 for further information.


2.0	DESCRIPTION

The Transportation Security Administration, at the request of the Office of Information Technology (OIT), and in support the OIT goals  to design, deploy, maintain and enhance the information technology essential for TSA to protect the Nation’s transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people; is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of a standardized, enterprise database solution. 

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

Conceptual technical architecture alternatives for a solution that will:
 
•	Interface with multiple systems (internal and external to TSA) to download required data into a standardized database.
•	Interface with authorized TSA users via a limited number of approved applications to sort and manipulate data located in the standardized database.
&#61599;	Report data in a variety of formats (including MS Excel, HTML, etc.) to TSA Stakeholders. 

3.0	REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for the Standardized Database Solution. TSA requires the conversion of existing operational Access databases to a stable, readily managed, multi-user environment to best support their day-to-day operations. The end state environment required is the target Oracle platform shared by TSA and DHS.  TSA has immediate needs to access and manage critical data during conversion with no operational downtime, and reach the end state Oracle environment in the quickest and most cost-effective manner.  An intermediate database environment would be acceptable while transitioning to Oracle, provided TSA’s data accessibility is not interrupted and this approach meets the business needs of TSA in a cost-effective manner.






TSA’s Office of Information Technology requires the ability to store, manipulate, and report unclassified yet sensitive data.  These capabilities are required short term to quickly support users from multiple departments within TSA using a standard data dictionary.

•	The Standardized Database Solution will eliminate redundant efforts (i.e., less employee time spent developing across the enterprise).
•	The Standardized Database Solution will be hosted in a central location, such as TSA’s hosting center that allows for 24 x 7 support and fault tolerance, depending upon the build, with a dedicated Database Administrator (DBA) to ease management and trouble-shooting of all applications.

TSA’s long term requirements involve the ability to download, store, manipulate, and report mission critical data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders.  This solution will:

&#61599;	Interface with multiple systems (internal and external to TSA) to download required data into the standardized DB created in Phase I.
&#61599;	Interface with authorized TSA users via a limited number of approved applications to sort and manipulate data located in the standardized DB created in Phase I.
&#61599;	Report data in a variety of formats (Including Excel, HTML, etc.) to TSA Stakeholders.

Other requirements not directly related to database architecture will be addressed at a later date.  Examples of such requirements include security policies and security management requirements, service level agreements, and other important considerations.

The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.


4.0	POSSIBLE NETWORK SOLUTION

The Standardized Database Solution will meet the functional requirements specified above.  The Government is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  The Government encourages creativity and outside the box thinking in responses to this RFI.  

The following parameters should be considered when developing a solution to TSA’s database conversion and management requirements:
&#61599;	Grouping TSA conversions in order to fully utilize economy of scale.
&#61599;	Eliminating database redundancies in TSA offices to minimize the number of conversions and subsequent data maintenance activities.
&#61599;	A transitional approach, initially converting TSA databases quickly to a less complex but stable multiple user’s environment to satisfy immediate customer needs.
&#61599;	Single server for all TSA conversions to consolidate and organize these databases for more orderly follow-on conversions or add-ons.
&#61599;	A two-phase solution:  
&#61599;	Phase 1- converting unclassified yet sensitive data located in multiple databases/spreadsheets (Microsoft Access, Excel, etc.) into a standardized database at a TSA specified data hosting facility.
&#61599;	Phase 2  - creating a long-term solution to download, store, manipulate, and report mission critical data to multiple internal and external TSA stakeholders.

Accordingly, respondents are encouraged to provide information about any alternatives that can be demonstrated to be immune from the kinds of disruptions described in section 3.0, above.


5.0	SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit. 

Section 1 – Conceptual Alternatives 

Briefly describe two or more alternative architecture concepts for the Standardized Database Solution, including the reliability and availability characteristics of the alternatives.  Discuss the capability for the solution to be hosted by a third party. (3-5 pages per alternative with one diagram of the hosting site  identifying the brand/type of equipment that would typically be deployed).

Section 2 – Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks of penetration.  (1 page per alternative)

Section 3 – Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost estimates for each alternative for 5 and 10-year contract terms for non-recurring and annual recurring costs.  The costs will include required hardware and software purchases, design and development costs, as well as maintenance and operational support needs. Also, discuss cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations (2-3 pages)








Section 4 – Corporate Expertise

INVENTION SUMMARY:

US Patent No. 6,730,180 - Neutron Absorbing Alloys

Increased reliance on nuclear energy to support the growing demand for electric power requires long-term storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF).  Because of past and future growth, the amount of nuclear fuel elements handled has increased.  To meet storage requirements, INEEL has developed a new class of advanced neutron absorbing structural alloys for use in spent nuclear fuel applications requiring structural strength, weldability, and long-term corrosion resistance.  Nickel-based alloys containing gadolinium prevent thermal neutrons from initiating unwanted nuclear chain reactions, exhibit excellent corrosion resistance and possess good welding characteristics.   BBWI is looking for potential licensees to manufacture and supply this material to companies working on government and commercial SNF storage facilities.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION REQUEST, BUT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IN THE FORM OF A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  NO APPROPRIATED FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. 

In an effort to promote financing competition for Air Force housing privatization projects, the Air Force is initiating a program to develop a list of financial firms that have the ability to finance Air Force housing privatization projects, as well as understand the terms and conditions included in Air Force transactional documents.  The Air Force intends to identify acceptable financial firms in a “Firms of Interest List” that will be provided to potential offerors as part of the Air Force solicitation for each project.  The solicitation will state that the financial firms identified on the “Firms of Interest List” have: (1) expressed an interest in Air Force housing privatization projects; (2) represented that they have the ability and experience to finance Air Force housing privatization projects; and (3) have acknowledged the terms and conditions included in Air Force housing privatization transactional documents.  Future solicitations will require that each offeror submit as part of the offeror's Step Two proposal term sheets from at least three listed "Firms of Interest," in addition to term sheets from any other financial firms the offeror may desire to use, and a commitment letter from the offeror's selected financing firm.  The commitment letter must identify the specific financing terms, including all fees, expenses, and an interest rate that includes a breakout of the underlying rate and spreads.  Therefore, the Air Force is writing you to request acknowledgement of the Generic Request for Proposal (RFP) appendices’ terms and conditions for the privatization of military housing.  The most current versions may be found at: 
http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/dc/dcp/news/legal/genericsolicitation.asp
The Air Force will include in the “Firms of Interest List” those financial firms that satisfy the following requirements:
1.	The firm must provide a written acknowledgment of the terms and conditions set forth in the Air Force generic Request for Proposal ("RFP"), including all appendices.  To the extent a firm takes exception to any of the standard terms and conditions, the Air Force encourages the firm to identify those exceptions under separate cover.  The purpose of the written acknowledgement is not to create a binding set of terms and conditions governing any potential transaction.  Rather, the purpose of the acknowledgment (and identification of exceptions, if appropriate) is to inform financial firms of the substance of the Air Force transactional documents with the expectation that such information will assist the Air Force and financial firms in identifying and limiting the scope of potential issues for negotiation in the event the firm is part of the selected offeror's team.
2.	The firm must represent that in the past three years the firm has closed (a) at least one multi-family debt financing; (b) at least one real estate debt financing over $100 million; and (c) one or more financing transactions totaling at least $300 million.
Please note that inclusion in the "Firms of Interest List" is at the full discretion of the Air Force.  Inclusion in the Firms of Interest List is not a pre-qualification of a firm's future proposals, nor is exclusion a disqualification.  
If your firm is interested in being included in the "Firms of Interest List," please complete the acknowledgment and representation set forth below.  This letter shall not be deemed either a formal offer or binding agreement of any kind.  Please return this letter and forward any exceptions via facsimile to Christopher Roth, Vice President, Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc., 1627 I Street, 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20006, facsimile number 312/601-1747.

<DESC>NA This amendment to DTRS57-04-S-ss527 is issued to change response date From May 27, 2004  to June 8, 2004 and Point of Contact Email Address to dohertyM@volpe.dot.gov  The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) in support of the FRA Human Factors R&D Program plans to procure expertise in occupational health psychology, industrial psychology and safety climate psychometric instrumentation and sources are sought for this expertise.  Current measures of occupational safety performance in the U.S. railroad industry focus almost exclusively on outcome measures such as worker injuries.  Fortunately for the industry injury rates have been declining over the last 25 years.  The industry incident rate fell from a high of 12.1 incidents per 100 workers per year in 1978 to 3.66 i n 1996.  Unfortunately for safety researchers and managers this drop in rates has made the use of injury rates as outcome measures suspect by many in the industry.  This procurement will focus on assisting the Volpe Center to identify alternative safety measures in the railroad industry.  One alternative measure found to relate to safety outcomes and reported in published studies is safety climate.  The contractor will be required to provide a finalized safety climate survey with accompanying response form, based on the draft survey provided by the Volpe Center.  The contractor will need to have expertise in on line and paper based surveys in order to design the instrument to address psychometric, and usability issues.  The contractor shall establish the validity and reliability of the ins trument.  The contractor will be required to electronically scan and analyze the collected survey data, write a report summarizing the findings using descriptive statistics and where appropriate inferential statistics.  The contractor will be required to advise on the appropriate statistics for the analysis including such techniques as inter-item correlations, correlations, regression and factor analysis. The survey will be administered at three Canadian railroad research sites at three points in time (baseline, mid term and follow up). The contractor must have prior research experience using established psychometric survey instruments in the areas of occupational health psychology, industrial and organization psychology, organizational behavior, occupational safety climate and/or union-ma nagement relations.  Previous experience with railroads, knowledge of railroad operating practices and railroad worker shift work influences preferred.  The contractor must be acceptable to railroad carrier management and the unionized workers at the three sites.   Interested offerors must submit a capabilities package in two copies demonstrating their abilities in each of the Organization Behavior and Safety Climate Psychometric Instrumentation areas cited above; this capabilities package should not exceed 5 pages. Interested parties must respond to this announcement in writing within 12 days of publication. FAX 617-494-3024 or email: dohertym@volpe.dot.gov response is acceptable. Telephonic requests will not be honored. This is not a solicitation or pre-solicitation. No award will be mad e from this Sources Sought announcement.

This project is to include GSA standards for secure facilities, as well as, specific tenant-agency security requirements.

This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A-E Firms and their Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A-E Firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture, partnership, or other legal entity that will have a contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility to conceive the design concept and the facility’s architecture.  The A-E Firm must address its contractual relationship with the Lead Designer, and the firm’s ability to manage the design and production of the construction documents.

In developing the project team required for Stage II, A-E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed within a seventy-five (75) mile radial distance from Columbus Circle, New York, NY.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expenses, or computer hookups for the prime firm or any consultants.

<CONTACT>Sonya Harmon, Contracting Officer, Phone 202/344-3727, Fax 202/344-1190, Email sonya.n.harmon@customs.treas.gov
<DESC>Background: The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs. These programs are located in various countries throughout the world and address the entire range of customs and border control operations. To effectively implement these programs, there is a need for the employment and utilization of contractors on an intermittent or short-term basis. Short term is defined as a single assignment for 90 days or less. Intermittent contractors (IC) will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with training utilizing specialized equipment or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide.  A more specific description of services or tasks shall be provided to the IC upon selection for employment. TRAINING: IC shall serve as a subject-matter expert and/or presenter. He/she may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. Instruction may include but is not limited to the areas of narcotic interdiction, post security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation. In general, the topic and content of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. COURSE DEVELOPER: IC shall develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors. Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control related areas such as those described for “Training” above.  ASSESSMENTS: IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs services and other border control agencies located in foreign countries. Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction or intellectual property rights). Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech) port security or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvement of such laws, or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. AUGMENTATION and REPLACEMENT: IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member. As an additional team member, the contractor will undertake general and specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of personnel policies. As a replacement or “fill in”, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time. REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND EXPERIENCE: The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to perform the general services noted above.  Candidates are expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction; to develop courses for one or more related areas described under the training task; to perform an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs to prepare trip reports, summaries, analyses, and recommendations; and necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional advisor, team member, or a replacement member. TERMS and CONDITIONS: ICs will work in an on-call or a when actually employed capacity. He/shell will be available for deployment to any country where CBP undertakes operations. Most assignments will be less than 30 days, with 5 days notice prior to departure. Some assignments may last up to 90 days. It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 90 days in a calendar year. If an IC turns down more than two assignments, he or she may be removed from further consideration at CBP’s discretion. COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: Compensation will be fixed-priced at $2000 per week or a proration thereof. It is anticipated, but not guaranteed, that each IC will work at least two (2) one-week assignments. The initial award will include medical evacuation coverage up to $500, and medical examination costs up to $500. Each assignment will be firm-fixed priced based on the estimated time required to complete the assignment. All travel will be under U.S. Government Travel orders and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government Travel Regulations. NOTE: The IC will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. CBP will purchase airline or other common carrier tickets after approval of travel. The IC will not receive an advance for lodging, meals and incidentals. OTHER REQUIREMENTS: All ICs will be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a “secret” security clearance from CBP, Office of Internal Affairs. For some specific assignments, language ability may be a requirement for selection. This will most often apply to work in Central and South America, which requires Spanish language ability. All material provided to the IC or developed by the IC under a resultant contract will become the property of CBP and may not released or disclosed without permission from CBP. DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which conducts operations.  The following countries are provided as an illustrative list of possible duty locations: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Colombia, Croatia, Cypress, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Ukraine. In addition, ICs may work from their home, CBP headquarters located in Washington, DC, or at other duty locations within the United States. METHOD of OPERATION: Potential ICs will submit their qualifications in resume format to be a part of the “bidders” list. The Office of International Affairs will evaluate candidates for technical ability. Candidates deemed to have the appropriate technical ability would then become part of a “pool” of eligible contractors/selectees who may receive requests for services for future assignments.  Selectees will be reimbursed for the cost of medical evacuation insurance and for a physical examination and certification that he/she is fit for travel any where in the world for assignments up to 90 days, in accordance with the paragraph “Compensation and Other Reimbursements” above. The resultant contracts will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including required services, estimated time required, duty location, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and any required materials. At the end of the assignment, the IC will submit an invoice for payment. All taxes (federal, state, and/or local) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income reporting requirements are responsibility of the IC as a 1099 vendor.

<DESC>Statement of Objective for Iraqi Police Service Selection Screening Process




1.0	  SUBJECT

The goal of this project is to develop, implement, evaluate and validate an Iraqi nationally standardized screening process that numerically quantifies what psychological profile and level of intellect is acceptable for service within IPS.  

2.0	  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

The Iraqi Police Service (IPS) has never developed or utilized any formal selection screening process.  Selection and hiring of potential police personnel was conducted in a haphazard, non-standard method.  As such, the individuals had no specific personal knowledge, skills or abilities (KSA’s) criterion to be rated against to ensure they met standards attributed to the ideal police candidate.  Due to this, many of the IPS currently employed lack the needed abilities or aptitude for the field of law enforcement.  Further, any number may manifest undesirable personal beliefs and psychological tendencies. 

The police community within the United States, Great Britain and Europe has been successfully utilizing psychological evaluation processes for several decades.   In each instance, a profile of desirable/undesirable traits are defined and validated.  The psychological profile is tailored to achieve several goals.  Initially, to determine if the mind set of the applicant is compatible with Law Enforcement.  It rates the basis of the individual’s integrity and ethical/moral beliefs as well as determining their impetus for becoming a member of Law Enforcement. Further it defines what level of aggressiveness is desired for the type of policing they are being selected to perform.  Also, the profile is used as a tool to identify and eliminate from consideration those with abnormal psychological tendencies and traits. 

The second tool within the selection screening process is that of aptitude testing.  It determines the applicant’s basic intellect and logical abilities.  Through testing of basic mathematics, language and reasoning skills, the applicant’s abilities can be quantified and evaluated for acceptability.

Together, the psychological and KSA profiles are quantitatively rated on a numerical basis to determine the applicant’s overall suitability for Law Enforcement.  
 
3.0	  OBJECTVE 

To develop, implement, evaluate and validate an Iraqi nationally standardized screening process that numerically quantifies what psychological profile and level of intellect is acceptable for service within the IPS.  Once in place, the ability to recruit, train and sustain the IPS will be greatly enhanced with the increase of efficiency and reduction in costs associated with recruiting. 

4.0   Training Requirement

4.1  To have a contractor with a proven background in law enforcement screening develop a program for the IPS.  Preferably, the selected contractor will have successful prior experience in developing programs for Mid-East culture(s).  All following objectives are to be part of contractor’s bid.

4.2 Identify/develop psychological profile and testing tailored to Iraq’s culture.  This must be reviewed by specialists with a refined knowledge of Iraqi cultural mores.

4.3 Identify/develop aptitude testing criterion and written test  tailored to Iraq’s culture.  This must be reviewed by specialists with a refined knowledge of the Iraqi culture.

4.4 Define a numerical rating for both the psychological and aptitude testing.

4.5 Define/develop the minimum numerical standard of acceptability for entrance into IPS.

4.6 All aspects of the selection screening documents are to be translated into the Arabic language.  Translated text is to be reviewed by outside unbiased party(ies) to ensure correctness of documents and to address any cultural differences/difficulties. 

4.7 Validate the screening documents by evaluating a selected group or entire class of IPS candidates from before the selection process, during training and in their initial job performance as IPS members.  Estimate screening of approximately 5000 for a class size of 500 qualified candidates.   Contractor required to conduct this process on site at Baghdad Police Academy located in Baghdad, Iraq.


Expected Results

4.8  Once validation is accomplished and any changes made, train the IPS to utilize the process.
  
•	Train specific IPS members (approximately 50) to administer the screening process and develop a syllabus to enable these same members to act as a cadre of instructors to train required cadres throughout the IPS. 

•	To conduct training for this one time class at the Baghdad Police Academy location. 

•	Develop and implement an administrative process to maintain records on the overall screening process. 

•	Create a database to track the program and to identify unsuitable applicants on the national level.  

•	Database is to be used by Iraqi IPS, all input must be bi-lingual (Arabic/English). 

•	Database is to have the ability to track this program indefinitely.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation seeks quotes for NEW equipment only; the Government will not consider quotes for refurbished equipment.  The Solicitation Number is SB1341-04-Q-0585.  The solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The requisition document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.  This solicitation is being conducted on an unrestricted competitive basis.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) (see http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html) code for this solicitation is 334516, and the small business size standard for that NAICS code is 500 or fewer employees.  THIS SOLICITATION IS SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES UNDER NAICS 334516 ONLY.  OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED FROM MANUFACTURERS OR THEIR AUTHORIZED RESELLERS ONLY.  NIST intends to conduct an on-line competitive “reverse auction” to be facilitated by a third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid.com.  FedBid.com has developed an on-line, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction.  Offerors may submit a series of pricing quotes, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.  All responsible sources MUST submit the pricing portion of their offer using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make an offer.  Offerors that are not currently registered to use FedBid.com Exchange should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.  Offerors that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID or via email at ClientServices@FedBid.com.  NIST is taking this action in an effort to improve vendor access and awareness of requests while expediting its ability to gather multiple, competed, real-time quotes for products. Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction by any means.  It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the bidding process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive bidding process.  The solicitation will start on June 1, 2004, and end on June 18, 2004 at 12:00:00 pm Eastern Time.  The selected Contractor must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions.  The list of contract line items numbers and items, quantities and units of measure are as follows: Item No. 0001, Bottom Loading Closed Cycle Refrigerators in accordance with the specifications noted below, Quantity: 3, Unit: Each; Item No. 0002, User Manuals for Item Number 0001; Quantity: 6; Unit: Each; Item No. 0003, Optional Extended Warranty for Item Number 0001; Quantity: 3; Unit: Each; Item Number 0004, Option for Increased Quantity of Item No. 0001; Quantity: 1, Unit: Each; Item Number 0005, Optional Extended Warranty for Item Number 0004, Quantity: 1; Unit: Each; Item Number 0006, User Manuals for Item Number 0004; Quantity: 2; Unit: Each.  THE SPECS FOR LINE ITEM 0001 ARE AS FOLLOWS: System Specification: Temperature range at the sample position: 4.2-325 K.  Cool down from room temperature to 10 K at the sample thermometer in less than 2 hours, with all radiation shields and sample mount.  Minimum 0.1 watts cooling power at 4.2 Kelvin.  System shall have the same cooling capacity at tilt angles up to 15 degrees from vertical.  Complete temperature control system shall include sensors, heaters, temperature controller, and connecting cables.  Temperature control shall be stable to within 0.5 degrees Kelvin below 50 K, within 1 % above 50 K.  Temperature sensor accuracy at the sample position: +/- 250 mK for T < 25 K, +/- 1% for T > 25 K.  The system shall be protected against thermal damage to the sensors or the cryostat from accidental overheating of the Cold head.  
Facility interface: The temperature controller shall communicate via RS-232 serial connection.  Electrical power requirement: must run on 30A, 220V single phase (NEMA L7-30); 20A, 208V three-phase (NEMA L21-20); or 20A, 120V single phase power (NEMA L5-20).  Electrical power connections shall extend at least 9 feet from equipment to power outlets.  The cryostat cold head shall provide lifting attachments for use with an overhead crane or hoist.  Cabling and hoses shall provide 15 feet of separation between cryostat and supporting compressor/temperature control.  ColdHead shall mount onto a goniometer via a bolted bottom flange.  The square mounting surface of the goniometer is 250 mm on an edge.  There are 4x M6 tapped holes in the mounting surface, arranged on a 230 mm bolt square (325.3 mm bolt circle diameter).  In addition, there are less stringent demands on the size of the entire cryostat.  As a guide, the entire cryostat should not exceed a diameter of 10 inches in the neutron beam path. Above the neutron beam path, the cryostat should be less than 24 inches in diameter.  The overall height should not exceed 6 feet in a running configuration.  The figures just listed are guidelines only, and are not absolute requirements.  Neutron scattering requirements: Cryostat shall provide 360 degree symmetrical access to the sample in the horizontal scattering plane without intersecting any part of the cooling system.  Only thinned aluminum or aluminum alloy windows shall be used in the horizontal scattering plane.  The maximum combined thickness of all neutron windows shall be 0.100 inches along a radial line from the outer containment wall to the middle of the sample space.  A detachable tailset shall consist of an outer vacuum can, a radiation shield thermally connected to the first stage, and a radiation shield thermally connected to the sample stage.  Because the NIST sample holders are relatively large (compared to x-ray samples) and thermal gradients need to be minimized, the radiation shield thermally connected to the sample stage is required.  The detachable tailset shall be engineered for routine and frequent assembly and disassembly using a simple, intuitive design.  The neutron beam (see figure 1.) shall be considered to have: A height of 2 inches, symmetric about the neutron beam centerline, with a vertical divergence of 5 degrees above and below the horizontal, starting from the center of the sample position.  Neutron beam centerline is located 6 inches above the mounting interface to the goniometer.  Sample mounting position is 1.75 inches above neutron beam centerline.  Item Number 0001 and Item Number 0002 must be offered and priced on an F.O.B. Destination basis.   Delivery for Item Number 0001 (and, if applicable, Item Number 0002) MUST be made to the address that will be specified in the purchase order (NIST, Building 301 Shipping and Receiving, 100 Bureau Drive, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899-0001).  The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  Award will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer confirming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Technical acceptability of items offered, in terms of whether they meet or exceed the specifications listed in this solicitation; (2) past performance information for the Offeror, and (3) evaluated price.  Non-price evaluation factors are significantly more important than evaluated price.  Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items, with their offer, with all applicable sections therein completed by the Offeror.  The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR AUTOMATED BATTERY TEST STAND.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to Questions 1 through 17 received.  The due date for receipt of offers is extended to June 9, 2004. Question 1:  Can Offeror propose system with one main channel to work only with predefine mapping to 24 Aux V, 4 Aux V (for current measurements), and 4 Aux T? Answer 1:  No.	It is important to cycle 9 batteries while recording the 24 auxiliary cell level voltages per battery (216 total), 36 string currents, and 36 string temperatures simultaneously. Question 2:  In Section 4.2.3, Do you mean that NASA will collect data of 100 samples per second for one main channels, 24 Aux V, 4 Aux V for current measurements only? Answer 2:  No.	It is important to cycle 9 batteries while recording the 24 auxiliary cell level voltages per battery (216 total), 36 string currents, and 36 string temperatures simultaneously. Question 3:  Is this meaning the data collection rate at 10 mS is acceptable?  Answer 3:  Yes, 10mS is acceptable but it must record for all 9 channels and auxiliary channels simultaneously. Question 4:  During the pulse step, can Offeror assume the data collection at the rate above does not happen at the same time for all channels? Answer 4:  No, during the course of 7 years, it is very probable that all 9 channels will pulse simultaneously. Question 5:  During the pulse step, does NASA need to collect temperature data at the fast data collection rate? Answer 5:  No, temperature can be recorded at a slow data acquisition rate. Question 6:  Section 3.3. In order to calibrate the channel, can the channels stop operating or running the test and resume after the calibration process is finish? Answer 6:  Yes. Question 7:  How large are the batteries and array size? Answer 7:  The test battery (P/N 157163) consist of 4 strings of 6 series lithium ion cells packaged in a customary design.  The battery contains one 50-pin connector.  Each string is terminated at the connector.	This allows us to reconfigure the battery bundle as 1P-24S, 2P-12S, or 4P-6S with our mating wire harness that mates to the battery connector.  Voltage sense leads for each cell are terminated at this connector.  The battery bundles will only be tested in the 4P-6S configuration.  The nominal voltage at discharge is 21.6V with a capacity of 8Ahr.  The length, width, height, and weight are approximately 7.5”, 3”, 3”, and 1,269, respectively. Question 8:  Is the ultimate location of the test site at a NASA site or should we include the option for housing everything?  Answer 8:  Yes, the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, is the location of the battery life cycle test. Question 9:  Should Offeror assume that the test stand temperature limits are as specified for the batteries.  Is a thermal chamber part of the test system? (9F to 54 F)  Answer 9:  Type T thermocouples to full range should be used.  The 5°C to 30°C (9°F to 54°F) is the thermal chamber environmental temperature. Question 10:  Is there a requirement for complex loading profiles? (Sawtooth, non-linear ramps, pulse trains, etc.) Answer 10:  Yes, see Section 4.2.3 for a worst case scenario (1 second at 160 Watts taking data at 100 samples per second on all 9 batteries with all the auxiliary voltage, current, and temperature measurements). Question 11:  What is the harness requirement, or limitation, from the test stand to the battery array? Answer 11:  Barrier Terminal Blocks with cable attachments Question 12:  The test stand size limit is specified as 7 feet by 6 feet by 8 feet high…does this also include the cells under test?  Answer 12:  No, the batteries will be inside a thermal chamber. Question 13:  Can Offeror unequally load the 3-phase supply? If not, what is the specification of the supply source? (Delta, 4-wire, Y, 5-wire, etc.)  Answer 13:  Yes.  The specification is:  4-wire Y. Question 14:  How are the thermocouples attached to the batteries? Answer 14:  Stick-on thermocouples are acceptable.  The thermocouples must have the ability to be removed from the test stand. Question 15:  Is there a strong preference of which software language is used to write the test code?  Answer 15:  No, but it must run on a windows platform.	A graphical user interface is required (no command line prompts will be accepted).  The operating system/battery test stand software must be proven to be glitch free and have the capability to run 7 continuous years with no operating system/software maintenance.  The system must be micro-controller based.  Refer to Section 3.2 for micro-controller instructions. Question 16:  Is there a strong preference of using some OTS loading-measuring equipment or should most partitions be custom designed-built? Answer 16:  No, off-the-shelf equipment is acceptable as long as it meets the requirements of the specification. Question 17:  Will the load banks that are part of the stand be cooled in any way?  Answer 17:  If load banks are used for discharging, they must be air cooled.  The transient voltage spike should be less than or equal to 10% of the battery full scale voltage during charge or switch to discharge.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 5:  The new closing date is 3 June 04 at 1500 hrs due to clarifications on previous questions.
Question 1:  Both terminations of the power cable must be defined.  At the unit proper, the choices are to hard wire the cable conductors into a power block OR provide a built in receptacle to accept a plug mounted on the cable. Typically, the opposite end of the cable would also have a plug that mates with the receptacle on the generator.  It would also be possible to hard wire the connection to the generator or a separate junction box.  There are almost an infinite number of plug and receptacle configurations available.  The length of the cable also must be specified. Answer 1:  As I do not know the correct field configuration of the generators to air conditioner units, the customer has stated that no less than 25 ft and no more than 50 ft is ample.  In regards to the power cable it will be twist lock on one end and pig tail on the other to allow for junction box and genrator attaching.  The generators to be used Qusetion 2:  Your response to the duct length question is concerning.  Ducts are not part of the solicitation but their length is necessary to properly calculate the total cooling load.  Please confirm that ducts are not part of the unit configuration. Answer 2:  Correct, ducts were not part of the original solicitation, however, I did not want to limit the requirements and leave some discretion and vendor knowledge to this task.  As the air conditioners will be placed outside of the tent and in talking with the customer, 15ft is ample enough duct work. Question 3: The cited factor of 400 SF equating to one (1) ton or 12,000 BTUH is somewhat simplistic and not appropriate for calculating the BTUH needed for this application.  Did you review our cooling load data submitted 25
May?  The ENTIRE surface area of the tent must utilized.  The totals needed for the two sample sizes referenced are accurate at your design conditions.  They should be adjusted based upon occupancy.( We used ten people in both examples )Answer 3: Yes the data was reviewed, however I cannot confirm how many people will be sleeping in the tent.  I assume no more than 15 personnel at any one time.  Also I do not know the total surface area.  It is my belief that the previous stated square footage is as close to accurate as the tents are close to 10 ft high on the inside. Question 4:We respectfully request a further extension for clarification insuring fully comparable offers. Answer 4:  You will be given until 1200hrs on 3 Jun for this extension.
Question 5: We assume that the Army is requesting self
contained package heat pumps rather than split
systems? In a split system, there is a separate air
handler connected to the heating/cooling unit; in a
self contained package, everything is contained in the
single unit which should work better in tents.  Is
this correct? Answer 5:  Correct, self contained Question 6:Is the total qty requested 28? Answer 6: Yes. Question 7:Does the Army have a desired efficiency rating for
the equipment (for instance: 10 SEER, 12 SEER, 14
SEER, etc.)Answer 7:  No the Army has not specified. Question 8: Are there any special specifications of the paint? Answer8:  At a minimum it should be desert tan in color, non reflective.  There are MILSPEC paints on the market, but this type of paint has not been specified for this solicitation.Question 9: Are standard wood skids acceptable for the equipment or are there specifications on them as well? Answer 9: The type of material for the skids has not been specified, however, a metal type skid is more desirable. Question 10: A 30 amp draw will allow a 5kw heat strip in the units.  We think that is sufficient to meet the
requirement as we understand it.  Does the Army have a
different view? Answer 10:  No. Question 11: 28,800 btu is just below a 2.5 ton unit (30,000btu).  Would a 2.5 ton unit at this btu be acceptable? Answer 11:  Yes Question 12: Does the Army know of any special filtration needs for the units?  (For instance, for sandy conditions)Answer 12:  No special filtrations have been requested, however, keep in mind that these units will be used in sandy conditions. These filtration units are desirable but not a must. Question 13: Is the due date on quotes 1 June?  If so, we would like to request an extension through 7 June to allow time for the Government to answer these questions and
to incorporate answers into our response.Answer 13:  The extension is for 1200hrs on 3 Jun 04.
