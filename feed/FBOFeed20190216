<DESC>THIS RFP IS BEING RE-RELEASED AS THE INITIAL RFP CONTAINED INCORRECT INFORMATION ON THE PRICING SPREADSHEET.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. <br />The solicitation number is NIH CC 18 007046REV1 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This procurement is a Competitive 8(a) set aside. The Government intends to solicit proposals from 8(a)'s under NAICS Code 561110.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items. A fixed-price type of contract is contemplated for this requirement.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-99-1 / 07-16-2018.<br />Background:<br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) is America's clinical research hospital and the world's largest hospital dedicated totally to clinical research. Through clinical research, promising discoveries in the laboratory are translated into better health and health care for all. Currently, there are approximately 1,500 active clinical research studies. <br />The vision of the NIH Clinical Center is to serve as the nation's premier research hospital for conducting clinical research to improve the health of human kind. It also serves as a national resource for clinical research by developing diagnostic and therapeutic interventions; enhancing systems to ensure the safe, efficient, and ethical conduct of clinical research; training clinical researchers; and leading the response to the nation's public health needs.<br />In 2005, the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center was opened. This state of the art facility is home to inpatient units, day hospitals and research labs and connects to the existing Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, which opened its doors to patients in 1953. Together, the Magnuson and Hatfield centers form the NIH Clinical Center, the world's largest clinical research complex, servicing a dual role: providing humane and healing patient care and an environment for clinical researchers to advance clinical science.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objective: <br />The NIH Clinical Center has a requirement to provide consistent and reliable Medical support assistant staffing for the Patient Support Services Department (PSSD) and the Nursing Department (ND) at the NIH Clinical Center. All locations where services are to be performed require direct contact with patient, visitors and staff in-person and by phone.<br />These positions are not office administrative positions. They are medical support assistants in a clinical research hospital setting.</p>
<p>See the attached combined/synopsis document for a full description, including instructions.<br />All questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by Monday, July 30, at 2 pm EST.</p>
