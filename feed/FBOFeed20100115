DESCRIPTION OF WORKThe Engineering firm shall provide all investigative surveys and verification of as-built conditions required for schematic development of construction documents for the campus wide replacement of the existing fire alarm system with a new state of the art analog addressable alarm distributed voice fire alarm system at the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center, Clarksburg, WV. The Engineering firm will develop schematic drawings, specifications and estimates that will be used in the competitive bid process for further development by a design/build firm that specializes in fire alarm system replacement. This project will NOT be a complete design but rather the preliminaries used for further development. Duration of project from award to 100% is 60 days. Construction period services extend past that time and will conclude when the design/build project is considered complete by the VA.   It is the intent of the Facility to replace the entire system, however, if costs are prohibitive, the project will be designed with deduct alternates so that as much of the system as possible can be installed.  Those buildings that become a deduct item and do not get new fire alarm system will be designed as a minimum to have their existing systems monitored by the new installation.  The new fire alarm system shall be of the latest technology in global addressable fire and smoke notification technology with true end-to-end intelligence between devices and the control panel.  The new fire system shall be "forward engineered and backward compatible" and provide a built-in migration path to the systems of the future. Design must meet all applicable federal, state and local codes/requirements including but not limited to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), and JCAHO standards.  The design is to follow VA criteria established in the VA Fire Protection Design Manual.  The Designer shall comply with the local fire authorities during the early stages of design to incorporate local requirements to the extent practical; however, recommendations made by local requirements should be reviewed for adequacy, cost and nationally accepted practice before being incorporated into project design.  Before any local authority requirements are included in the design, they must be specifically identified by the designer and approved by the VA.The fire alarm system will be designed to be monitored at the Telephone Operator's Room and Boiler Plant.  The design team shall be responsible to provide site plans and drawings necessary for all wiring between the buildings. 	The scope of the project will also include the following:1.	Limited architectural, mechanical and electrical design to improve and expand the fire alarm equipment, control, electrical foreman and monitoring rooms.2.

The designer shall direct the contractor around the known asbestos locations if possible.6.	Prepare a phasing sequence that will promote the efficient transfer from existing to new campus wide fire alarm system.  At project completion the existing system including wiring shall be removed once the new system has been tested and accepted.  This will be reflected on the drawings as well as in a narrative format.7.	Documents will include deduct alternates to reduce scope of work for construction phase if necessary.  Field survey to include all areas above, below, and adjacent to the work site that will be affected by the construction project.  Investigations shall include the existing building structure and any system modifications necessary to maintain adjacent facilities.  Existing building system shutdowns shall be kept to a minimum.  Construction estimates of contract time and cost will be required at each project submission.  Areas that need to be installed after normal hours will be identified in the narrative, designated on the drawings, and accounted for in the associated costs estimates. The Engineering firm will be required to collaborate with the Department of Veterans Affairs staff to determine fire protection, architectural, mechanical and electrical design requirements.  Drawings concerning the existing conditions and site plans will be provided to the Engineering firm.

<CONTACT>BAA-10-20 Administrator, Email BAA10-20@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of Deep Ocean Operations. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.
<p>Air and space were once unused operational domains which today are central to our nation's security and economic vitality. As technology drives peer nation parity in traditional domains, the deep ocean offers an unused operational space to achieve significant gains in strategic capability. The program goal is to introduce surveillance that operates at extreme ocean depths to detect quiet submarines overhead. Such surveillance should exploit the unique propagation and signal advantages afforded by operating in the deep ocean. The presumption is that the deep ocean offers advantages for sonar, however non-acoustic solutions that benefit from deep ocean operations are acceptable as well. Success for the program is challenged by the ability to achieve long-range detection and classification; the means to communicate underwater over long distances; and the ability to manage energy to endure. These challenges are magnified by extreme conditions of pressure, temperature, and isolation that constrain solutions.</p>
<p>The program will develop systems of configurable technology to achieve ASW surveillance needs over large, operationally relevant, deep ocean areas. The solution space is characterized as one that:</p>
<p>&bull; Operates with sensors or sources near the ocean bottom, <br />&bull; Exploits the advantages of distributed nodes,<br />&bull; Configures to a range of operations, environments, and time scales, and<br />&bull; Adapts to the mobility of the surface assets or evolving threats.</p>
<p>For proposal to be considered, proposers must have at least a secret facility clearance and evidence of the capability to conduct secret level research. Offerors are strongly encouraged to review the addendum to this BAA before considering a proposal submission. BAA Section 4.1, and BAA Enclosure A, provide the instructions to request the material.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) will be soliciting proposals to assist ETA in providing technical assistance in support of its YouthBuild programs.  The contractor will provide support for all related technical activities required by ETA.   

YouthBuild is a youth workforce development program that helps disadvantaged youth gain high school credentials and skill training that leads to employment.  YouthBuild provides job training and educational opportunities for at-risk, and out-of-school youth ages 16 through 24 while constructing or rehabilitating affordable housing for low-income or homeless families in poor communities.  While enrolled in a YouthBuild program, participants split their time between a construction site and a classroom, where they earn their GED or high school diploma, learn to be community leaders, and prepare for college and other postsecondary training opportunities.  

The YouthBuild program was transferred from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the Department of Labor (DOL) in September 2006. The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) began administration of the YouthBuild program beginning in FY 2007. DOL has administered one full cycle of the YouthBuild program (two years of program operation) since its transfer and has recently completed its second competition.  This competition, which utilized both American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) funds of $50 million as well as the 2009 appropriation funds of $70 million resulted in an increase in the number of YouthBuild programs supported by DOL and the number of disadvantaged youth served.   

The successful offeror will provide technical assistance to approximately 200 grantees for the first period of performance.  

The purpose of the YouthBuild Technical Assistance contract is to support ETA in the provision of services that will improve program performance and program outcomes for participants in DOL funded YouthBuild programs in the areas of:  
	--Placement in employment or education 
	--Attainment of a degree or certificate
	--Literacy and numeracy gains
	--Retention in employment and education
	--Reduction in recidivism rates 

The technical assistance will assist YouthBuild grantees to improve academic offerings, provide industry-recognized construction skill training, introduce YouthBuild staff and participants to high-growth, high-wage industries, and make stronger connections with other system partners to prepare our nation’s most vulnerable youth for productive lives. 
The overall goals for the technical assistance strategy are to assist YouthBuild sites to: 
	--Improve academic programs including professional development for teaching    staff and GED curricula 
	--Improve literacy/numeracy outcomes 
	--Increase post-secondary exploration, planning, and placement 
	--Integrate nationally recognized energy efficiency and renewable energy training into existing construction training programs
	--Improve connections to registered apprenticeship programs 
	--Improve connections to business partners, both nationally and at the local level 
	--Improve connections to the One-Stop Career Center system 
	--Improve connections with community colleges 
	--Improve and ensure occupational safety at YouthBuild work sites 
	--Use data to manage programs 
	--Strengthen partnerships with other government agencies that serve the neediest youth including the juvenile justice system, the foster care system, etc. 

ETA’s authority to use these funds is limited by the YouthBuild authorizing statute.  Under that law, the only entities we have authority to select for contracts funded with the YouthBuild 5% funds for training, information, technical assistance and data management, ... are “qualified national nonprofit agencies." 29 USC 2918a(f).  

There will be a pre-proposal conference.  Interested Parties should send an e-mail to Marsha Daniels (daniels.marsha@dol.gov) with their intent to attend.

This software will integrate Deparment overseas providers with electronic access to the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) designated by the health insurer utilized by the FS employee. Use of e-prescribing software will relieve the health care staff from mailing or faxing the prescription to the appropriate pharmacy benefit manager. In addition, overseas providers will be able to access the past three years of prescribing history for each patient. The verification of eligibility requirement is critical to ensure that FS employees and dependants are not denied coverage or are delayed from obtaining the medication if the prescription is sent to wrong pharmacy benefit manager. It should also be noted that e-prescribing has the proven benefits of reducing medication errors, improving clinical efficiency, and reducing overall healthcare costs. It is an integral component of the present initiative to overhaul and improve the US healthcare system. The statutory authority permitting other than full and pen competition is 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Office of Medical Services has used RxNT for the past three years and has found the software extremely user friendly; it provides all functionality that we require. RxNT also provides critical application support on a 24x7 basis. RxNT offers functionality in all three areas as evaluated by SureScripts. Surescripts is the independant organization that evaluates e-prescribing software as to its functionality in meeting the three required areas of integration, its commitment to e-prescribing, and whether the company is committed to improving their product by developing new approaches to e-prescribing. The commitment to improving the electronic prescribing system is critical to the Office of Medical Services, as we are not sure at this point that our future Electronic Health Record System will have the capability of transmitting prescriptions outside of the EHR. RxNT presentlly enljoys the heighest evaluation ranking by Surescripts, that of "Platinum", and is only one of two systems to enjoy that ranking.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for:	The NASA GSFC IRAD to develop a non-mechanicalbeam scanner that integrates with an optical planar waveguide amplifier module for futurespace based remote sensing instrument such as the Lidar Surface Topography (LIST)mission.  The work required can be categorized into four sections:1.	Design Scanner/Amp. Integration Theoretically Explore Feasibility of Integrating EO Scanner Directly on Top of the YAGAmplifier:  In order to produce the optical power levels required for LIST (approximately100 microJoules) a planer waveguide amplifier will be used.  The core of this waveguideamplifier has an index of approximately 1.82.  In principle, the EO scanner may be builtdirectly on top of the amplifier, thereby providing an extremely compact and rugged,fully integrated device.  This task shall be completed by September 20102.	Scanner Design Propose Designs that Meet the Requirements for LIST:  For a beam with wavelength = 1030nm launched from a satellite at an altitude of 500 km to have a 1/e2 diameter spot of 5meters on the Earth the 1/e2 diameter of the launch aperture must be approximately 13 cm. Furthermore, from an altitude of 500 km, to have a linear swath of 5 km on the Earth theoutput must scan over approximately 0.6o.  In optics, one may always trade-off betweenscan angle and aperture, i.e., one can use a telescope to decrease the aperture but thescan angle must increase an equal amount to preserve the number of resolvable spots inthe far field.	A possible embodiment for LIST will be a scanner with a 1 cm wideaperture that scans over 8 degrees. This task shall be completed by July 2010.3.	Feasibility Demonstration  Experimentally Demonstrate the Feasibility of Approach:  In this task a 1-D EO scannerthat steers a 1 cm wide beam over 8 degrees will be built.  Given the budget, this willlikely be demonstrated at wavelength=1550 nm (ideally at 1030 nm).  Nevertheless, thiswill be a compelling demonstration of this feasibility of this approach.  We will alsouse this scanner to explore the trade-off between scanner resolution and speed ofoperation.  An important result will be to demonstrate a path to 10 kHz scanning.

The Framingham SABRe CVD Initiative Study under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of NIH is conducting a study to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) by following the development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who have not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke.  The study will expand research to include genomic biomarkers in CVD and will collaborate with other leading researchers across the country and world on various projects, such as, stroke and dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis and genetic patterns of common diseases. The collaborative study in biomarkers will analyze 7000 samples on Human Exon arrays to identify different expressed genes and associated alternative splicing events using the Affymetrix Platform.  Specifically, the study will identify genes with altered expressions in heart, lung, and blood disorders and in a parallel study alternative splicing events during the disease process.  The studies will be conducted in phases and the intent is to analyze gene expression in WBCs blood samples (n=2000) from Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants.  Therefore, NHLBI is in need of NuGEN Technologies WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System Automation to amplify 50 ng of total RNA from whole blood.

<DESC>Introduction<br />Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten billions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) promotes and supports research to enhance the understanding of basic immunology, and the etiology, treatment and prevention of immune-mediated diseases. As part of its biodefense research program, NIAID is issuing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to encourage research to understand the immune status of special populations. The solicitation title is "PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS". The solicitation number is BAA-NIAID-DAIT-NIHAI2010085.<br /><br />Description <br />As part of its biodefense research program, NIAID is issuing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to encourage research to understand the immune status of special populations. This research program seeks to identify the factors and mechanisms that contribute to susceptibility to infection from or limit vaccine efficacy against potential bioterrorism agents and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases in immunocompromised populations, including neonates, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals receiving immunosuppressive drug therapies to treat a defective immune response or to suppress the rejection of transplanted organs. The continued threat of bioterrorism and greater worldwide spread of emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases underscore the need for vaccines and immune-based therapeutics that can protect the entire population. For example, the number of the most vulnerable individuals, in terms of immune status, is increasing. More effective and better tolerated vaccines and immunotherapies are required for these immunocompromised populations. Research is needed to understand the mechanisms of immune compromise, and to provide the foundation for the development of novel interventions.<br /><br />For this initiative, special populations are defined as neonates, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women the elderly, and individuals who are receiving immunosuppressive drug therapies to treat a defective immune response or to suppress the rejection of transplanted organs. All of these populations are referred to as &lsquo;immunocompromised' throughout the solicitation. This research program seeks to identify the factors and mechanisms that contribute to increased susceptibility to infection from or limit vaccine efficacy against potential bioterrorism agents and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases in these immunocompromised populations. The continued threat of bioterrorism and greater worldwide spread of emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases underscore the need for vaccines and immune-based therapeutics that can protect the entire population. More effective and better tolerated vaccines and immunotherapies are required for these immunocompromised populations. <br /><br />This solicitation is a recompetition of the Immune Function and Biodefense in Children, Elderly and Immunocompromised Populations program, with a focus on the mechanisms of immunosuppression. Although progress has been made towards the original goals of the prior solicitation, further examination of immunocompromised populations is needed. This BAA is soliciting proposals that identify and characterize the mechanistic cause(s) of immune dysfunction as a result of infection, vaccination, or therapeutic interventions against emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases and potential agents of bioterrorism and their toxins (listed as NIAID Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases and NIAID Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens). Therefore this solicitation will seek proposals that investigate the mechanisms of immunosuppression in immunocompromised populations. As stated above, immunocompromised populations are defined as the following for this solicitation: neonates and/or young children under 5 years of age, pregnant women, elderly populations, transplant patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and patients with autoimmune disorders receiving immunosuppressive therapy. The immunocompromised populations <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no longer include</span> cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation, and individuals receiving bone marrow transplant with primary immunodeficiency disease or cancer. In addition, this current solicitation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no longer supports</span> the development of treatments to enhance immune responses in immunocompromised populations. Funding under the prior solicitation is <strong>NOT</strong> required for submission to this current solicitation.<br /><br />Areas of interest for examination under the Protective Immunity in Special Populations Program involve the characterization of immune defects to infection, vaccination, or therapeutic interventions in immunocompromised populations with respect to emerging/re-emerging infectious agents and potential agents of bioterrorism and their toxins. Examples of potential research focus are:
<p>&bull; defects in signaling pathways and regulatory networks of Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), Nod-Like Receptors (NLRs), and other pathogen recognition molecules;<br />&bull; altered expression or activation of anti-microbial peptides and other host anti-microbial molecules;<br />&bull; defects in T cell activation, effector function, and memory;<br />&bull; deficits in innate immune orchestration of adaptive immune responses; <br />&bull; changes in T cell repertoire;<br />&bull; changes in antigen receptor signaling capabilities; <br />&bull; defects in B cell activation, including plasma cell differentiation, antibody production and class switching, and generation of memory; and<br />&bull; alterations in antigen processing and presentation events, such as antigen presenting cell maturation, differentiation, and function during infection or following vaccination or immunotherapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>Research teams from all contracts supported by the Protective Immunity in Special Populations program are expected to exchange ideas; share information on technical objectives, progress, and impediments through, for example, annual program progress meetings; and where appropriate, establish collaborations.</p>
<p>Statement of Work: Offeror(s) are required to develop their own Statement of Work. Offerors are advised to limit the amount of proprietary data or markings in their Statement of Work. The final negotiated Statement of Work will be incorporated into the contract upon an award and may be subject to release to the public. If the Statement of Work does include proprietary data or markings, offeror(s) are advised to clearly mark these portions and provide an explanation why these data/markings are proprietary.</p>
<p>All proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria: scientific and technical approaches to address the mandatory components described above; expertise and qualification of the scientific and technical personnel including the principal investigator and the project manager; the project management plan; and facilities, equipment, and other resources.</p>
<p>The NIAID anticipates that one or more cost reimbursement completion-type awards will be made beginning on or about March 1, 2011 utilizing special contracting methods, FAR Subpart 17.1 - Multi-year Contracting. The NIAID estimates that the average annual total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) will be $1.5 million per contract. However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s). The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed five 5 years.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. This BAA will be available electronically on/about January 29, 2010, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov). This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

Jennifer L. Thompson, Contracting Officer, 202/781-4354, jennifer.l.thompson1@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will utilize other than full and open competition to award a contract for production, integration, testing and engineering support services for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar transmitter group and Missile Fire Control System (MFCS) MK 99 for DDG 113-115 to Raytheon Company, Integrated Defense Systems (Raytheon IDS) in Tewksbury, MA. The Government anticipates procuring DDG 113-related long lead material and other non-recurring engineering (NRE) efforts in FY09. Options for DDG 113 equipment procurement in FY10 and DDG 114-115 equipment procurements in FY11 will be executed as separately priced options.
Raytheon IDS will be responsible for the production and test of the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar transmitter group, which consists of RF driver and amplification cabinets, a RF monitoring cabinet, high voltage power supplies and isotransformers. In order to test and deliver a fully integrated MFCS MK 99, Raytheon will design and manufacture the MFCS MK99 CWI elements, which consist of MK 82 Director antennas, waveguide elements between the transmitter and antenna, and a data conversion cabinet, and integrate the MFCS elements that are delivered under separate contracts (e.g., MK 82 Director/MK 200 Director Controller). Raytheon will also be responsible for testing of the fully integrated MFCS MK99. If all options are exercised, the maximum quantities procured will be three AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar transmitter groups and three MFCS MK 99 shipsets.
After production, the Radar transmitter group and MFCS MK 99 will be shipped to the Production Test Center (PTC) in Moorestown, NJ for integration with the remainder of the Aegis Weapon System (AWS) and system level testing by Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors (LM MS2). Raytheon IDS will be responsible for providing technical and engineering services at the PTC during integration and test, and at shipyards during construction or as a result of sea trials and other relevant special studies. 
Raytheon IDS is the only existing source with the in-depth technical expertise, knowledge, resources and infrastructure required to produce the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar transmitter group and MFCS MK 99 without adverse impact to the USN shipbuilding and ship deployment requirements. Raytheon IDS has been the prime production contractor for the AN/SPY-1 transmitter group since the first contract was awarded for the AWS effort in 1969.  They have also been the principal subcontractor to LM MS2 for past Transmitter and MFCS modification developments and are the design agent for the MFCS MK 99.  Under separate contracts, Raytheon IDS is developing Radar transmitter group and MFCS upgrades for Aegis AMOD Upgrade and BMD 4.0.1, all of which will be part of the DDG 113 - 115 AWS configuration.  As such, Raytheon IDS understands the system functionality and requirements in order to produce these systems to satisfy AWS requirements. 
In considering the schedule requirements for deliveries, it is critical to note that the complete AWS must begin testing at least nine (9) months in advance of the ship's Required Delivery Date (RDD). In order to deliver a fully functionally tested AWS by the RDDs for each of these ships, the Navy must award this procurement on a sole-source basis.  If the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar transmitter group or MFCS MK 99 contracts were to be awarded to another company for any of the three ships, the schedule to develop Level III Technical Data Packages, conduct the competition, perform production qualification, and integrate and test the complete AWS would cause the delivery to miss the respective RDD by a significant amount of time.  
For the reasons stated above, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to award a contract for the production, integration, testing and engineering support services for the AN/SPY-1D(V) Radar Transmitter Group and MK99 Missile Fire Control System (MFCS) for DDG 113-115 to Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) in Tewksbury, MA. Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon directly. See Note 22.

The Government anticipates procuring DDG 113-related long lead material and other non-recurring engineering (NRE) efforts in FY09. Options for DDG 113 equipment procurement in FY10 and DDG 114-115 equipment procurements in FY11 will be executed as separately priced options.
LM MS2 will be responsible for production and fabrication of the AWS AN/SPY-1D(V) arrays (4 per shipset), including an integrated Multi-Mission Signal Processor (MMSP), Aegis AMOD Upgrade equipment (AAU), and Combat System Support Equipment (CSSE) for DDG 113-115.  In addition, LM MS2 will be responsible for the production of an MMSP to be installed at the Surface Combat System Center (SCSC), Wallops Island, VA to support combat system certification and life cycle support.  LM MS2 will also be responsible for integration of the AWS elements delivered under separate contracts (e.g., Missile Fire Control System MK99, AN/SPY-1D(V) radar transmitter group, computers and displays) and system level testing at the Production Test Center (PTC) in Moorestown, NJ. LM MS2 will be responsible for providing technical and engineering services at the PTC during integration and test, and at shipyards during construction or as a result of sea trials and other relevant special studies. If all options are exercised, the maximum quantities procured for three complete AWS shipsets and SCSC will include twelve AN/SPY-1D(V) arrays, four MMSPs, three AAU sets and three CSSE sets. 
LM MS2 is the only existing source with the in-depth technical expertise, knowledge, resources and infrastructure required to produce, integrate, and test the MK 7 AWS without adverse impact to scheduled AWS deliveries in support of the USN shipbuilding and ship deployment requirements.  LM MS2 possesses unique experience in AWS design, development, production, assembly, and testing, and currently provides the necessary services to deliver fully functionally tested AWS ship sets to the fleet.  LM MS2 also provides installation material, ancillary equipment, provisioning items, technical data, and provisioning technical data.  As such, it understands the system functionality and requirements in order to produce systems that satisfy the AWS requirements and is compatible with existing components and infrastructure of the ACS. All previous AWS production contracts for this equipment have been awarded to Lockheed Martin MS2 (or its antecedents) since the authorization of the first Aegis Cruiser. Furthermore, LM MS2 has developed an extensive infrastructure (e.g., production facilities, qualified supplier base, special test equipment, data networks, system test environments, producibility engineering workstations) at its Moorestown, NJ facility to support AWS production.  
In considering the schedule requirements for deliveries, it is critical to note that the complete AWS must begin testing at least nine (9) months in advance of the ship's Required Delivery Date (RDD). In order to deliver a fully functionally tested AWS by the RDDs for each of these ships, the Navy must award this procurement on a sole-source basis.  If any element of this procurement were to be awarded to another company for any of the three ships, the schedule to develop Level III Technical Data Packages, conduct the competition, perform production qualification, and integrate and test the complete AWS would cause the delivery to miss the respective RDD by a significant amount of time.  Similarly, the award of an MMSP production contract to meet the SCSC requirements to another company would significantly delay combat system certification. 
For the reasons stated above, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), NAVSEA intends to award a contract for the production, integration, testing and engineering support services for production, integration and test of the MK 7 Aegis Weapon System (AWS) for DDG 113-115 and an MMSP at SCSC, Wallops Island, VA to Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems & Sensors (LM MS2) in Moorestown, NJ. Parties interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact LM MS2 directly. See Note 22.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Testing Services</strong></p>
<p>The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is conducting market research to identify potential sources who are interested in and capable of providing the testing services described herein. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any further RFP, if any is issued.&nbsp; <strong>All questions regarding tis RFI must be submitted electronically to </strong><a href="mailto:Illona.WIlliams@ots.treas.gov"><strong>Illona.WIlliams@ots.treas.gov</strong></a><strong> no later than 2:00 PM, January 22, 2010.&nbsp; Telephonic inquiries will not be accepted.&nbsp; The questions and answers will be posted to this website as a modification to the RFI.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND AND BUSINESS NEED</strong></p>
<p>The OTS, an office within the Department of the Treasury, is the federal bank regulator and supervisor of savings associations and their holding companies. The OTS workforce consists of over 1,000 employees located across the continental U.S.</p>
<p>The OTS accredits its examination staff, and its Professional Development office oversees the OTS examiner accreditation training programs, including the administration of the capstone knowledge tests (i.e., the Safety and Soundness Comprehensive Test (SSCT) and Compliance Comprehensive Test (CCT)) administered toward the end of the programs. The SSCT and CCT each consist of 150 multiple-choice questions that take up to four hours to complete. The OTS Safety and Soundness examiners take the SSCT, while the OTS Consumer Compliance examiners take the CCT.</p>
<p>Test administration currently occurs in one of the OTS's four regional offices located in Jersey City, NJ; Atlanta, GA; Chicago, IL; and Dallas, TX. Because test participants can be located several hundred miles from a regional office, the OTS is considering outsourcing its test administration function to a source capable of administering the paper-and-pencil tests at multiple testing sites nationwide to minimize test participants' travel time and expenses.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p>The OTS seeks interested vendors who are capable of providing test administration facilities, services, and related support to register eligible test candidates for and to deliver the accreditation knowledge tests (i.e., SSCT and CCT). The overall scope includes:</p>
<p>-Administering up to two versions of each knowledge test (i.e., SSCT versions A and/or B and CCT versions A and/or B) in paper-and-pencil medium on no less than two test dates a year in the morning and/or afternoon to approximately 60 test candidates a year.</p>
<p>-Administering and proctoring the four-hour long tests during weekday normal business hours at a network of established test centers located throughout the continental U.S.</p>
<p>-Registering eligible test candidates for the appropriate test and version of the test, test date, test time, and test center, at a minimum, on the weekdays during normal business hours. Test candidates should be able to search for the nearest test center via a website.</p>
<p>-Duplicating and distributing hard copies of the test materials (i.e., test booklets formatted in MS Word and pre-printed machine-readable answer sheets (Scantron response forms)) to the appropriate test centers.</p>
<p>-Shipping all completed test materials to the OTS for scoring.</p>
<p>-Providing the OTS with registration status reports, cancellation/no show reports, and test administration summary reports in electronic format.</p>
<p><strong>To assist the OTS in further developing the scope and requirements, the OTS would like your response to the following questions:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Other than what is mentioned in this RFI, what additional details would you need from or questions would you pose to the OTS in order to provide a firm fixed price type order if an RFP for these services is solicited in the future?<br /><br />2.&nbsp; How many days prior to the first test date do you recommend a contract for these services be established?<br /><br />3.&nbsp; What means of test registration (e.g., telephone, web-based system, email, or in-person) does your company provide and when is the registration service(s) available to test candidates?<br /><br />4.&nbsp; Approximately how many test centers in your network are based in the U.S.? How many U.S. states are included in your test center network?<br /><br />5.&nbsp; What are the typical hours of operation for the majority of your test centers in the U.S.?<br /><br />6.&nbsp; What percentage of your network of test centers are owned and operated by your company?<br /><br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does your company currently possess the equipment and capability to score Scantron ParScore forms and export the individual test response data as a ParScore-readable file or CSV file?<br /><br />8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does your company have the existing capability to data automate and program randomized computer-based, multiple-choice tests and is your network of test centers currently capable of administering computer-based tests?</p>
<p><strong>RFI RESPONSE GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES:</strong></p>
<p>All interested parties capable of providing the testing services described in this RFI are invited to submit information that includes:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Company name and address.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Contact name, telephone number, and email address.<br /><br />3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Type of business and size.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brief (500 words or less) overview of your company and the services it provides.<br /><br />5.&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of your firm's capabilities and qualifications as they relate to the business need and general requirements stated in this RFI.<br /><br />6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Responses to the questions posed in this RFI.<br /><br />7.&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of one or more successful implementations of your services in a circumstance similar to the business need stated in this RFI. Provide customer contact information where that solution was implemented, including contact name, organization, telephone number, and email address, for each example that you provide.<br /><br />8.&nbsp;&nbsp;GSA Schedule information (if applicable).<br /><br />9.&nbsp;&nbsp;A rough estimate (or cost range) of the cost that you believe is likely to be incurred by the OTS for the services your firm would provide, with some discussion of the factors or components contributing to the cost (e.g., number of test dates, number of test participants, number of tests, test time duration, optional services, etc.). The OTS understands that your provision of this information is not a price proposal nor is the OTS seeking a proposal at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Responses to the information requested shall be limited to no more than fifteen (15) pages. Any information received marked "Proprietary" will be handled accordingly.</strong></p>
<p>Responses to this RFI will not be returned. No feedback will be provided on individual submissions. Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess the cost effectiveness, benefits, and tradeoffs of outsourcing the OTS's test administration function and to assist the OTS in developing its acquisition strategy, including the method of competition and applicable terms and conditions of a solicitation, if one is issued.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE.  The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start (OHS), through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Zero to Three, 2000 M Street, Northwest Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036, TO EXTEND ITS CURRENT CONTRACT, number HHSP23320042900YC, for six (6) months.  The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(c), as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

OHS is seeking a six-month extension to its contract for the Early Head Start National Resource Center (EHSNRC) with Zero to Three.  Zero to Three provides technical assistance (TA) and support to more than 700 Early Head Start (EHS) programs across the country serving 62,000 children and families.  As a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), an additional 600 programs were recently funded, serving an additional 50,000 children.  This funding created almost twice the number of Early Head Start (EHS) grantees.  All grantees are required to attend national orientation to begin work with pregnant woman, infants and toddlers.  Two of the orientations are taking place through the current contract period and two additional national orientations will take place 2 to 3 weeks after the current contract’s expiration.  The OHS is working with the PSC to get a follow-on contract in place; however a long, competitive acquisition process is expected, which will exceed the current contract’s expiration.  Services cannot be suspended between the time the current contract expires and a new contract is awarded.  The 600 new grantees need immediate and continued support.  A break in service will jeopardize support services to newly awarded ARRA-funded expansion grantees.  Zero to Three is the only firm with the capacity to complete the tasks that must be continued though the spring of 2010.

The statement of work will remain the same during the extension period.  The following tasks need to continue, uninterrupted, to accommodate the funding of the 600 new ARRA EHS grantees.  

1.  Maintain and monitor the toll-free number and phone and email information requests.  The current system will need to be expanded to include new parties. 

2.  Plan and conduct Leadership Seminars.  In response to the ARRA funding, OHS has hired new federal staff across the country to award funding and monitor newly awarded grantees.  Zero to Three will conduct Leadership Seminars during winter and spring, 2010.

3.  Plan and conduct National Orientation Conference.  The OHS requires that new grantees attend a National Orientation Conference.  Two National Orientation Conferences will be held during the extension period.  New grantees are required to attend a National Orientation Conference.

4.  Disseminating materials to Federal Staff, TA staff and newly awarded ARRA EHS programs.  Materials are disseminated to all federal, TA and program staff to ensure everyone has the same information.  The material is also used to build capacity of new programs at the individual program level.  

Zero to Three is uniquely qualified to continue the tasks and complete them in the 6 month time period.  Zero to Three has been the contractor for the EHSNRC, since Early Head Start was established in 1995.  Zero to Three trains and supports professionals, policymakers and parents in their efforts to improve the lives of infants and toddlers.  In the initial funding of Early Head Start grantees in 1996, and the expansions in the few years following, Zero to Three took a leadership role in providing services, resources, materials, and training to new grantees.  Early Head Start presented unique challenges to the Head Start community, and Zero to Three’s EHSNRC has provided outstanding leadership and support to the federal government and new grantees.  

Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit a capability statement that demonstrates their ability to provide the services required in the timeframe required.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE; THEREFORE, REQUEST FOR SUCH DOCUMENT WILL BE CONSIDERED INVALID RESPONSES.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Officer will proceed with the modification.

(XI)	Description: The Contractor shall furnish all labor, management, supervision, materials, equipment, and local transportation necessary to provide training and technical assistance to public or private nonprofit corporations, agencies, institutions, organizations and other associations, including Indian tribes, eligible to receive assistance under the Section 523 Mutual Self-Help Technical Assistance Grant Program in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1944-I (available in any Rural Development Office or at the following website: http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/regs/regs/pdf/1944i.pdf 


Currently, there are (16) “Grantee” organizations in Region 1.  (27) "Grantee" organizations in Region 2.   (15) "Grantee" organizations in Region 3.  (58) "Grantee" organizations in Region 4.  There is one contract for each of the four (4) Regions at this time and all of these existing contracts will expire on March 31, 2010   It will be RHS’ intention to award new contract(s) to continue the existing service to the Self-Help Grantees in each of the Regions. 

The RHS, an Agency within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is a credit Agency for housing loans and grants to assist low and very low-income rural residents.  The RHS is one Agency in the Rural Development mission area of USDA.  One of the many programs administered by the RHS is the Section 523 Mutual Self-Help Technical Assistance Grant program.  The Section 523 Mutual Self-Help Technical Assistance Grant program is authorized under Section 523 of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended.

The primary purpose of the Self-Help Technical Assistance Grant program is to fund nonprofit organizations, more commonly referred to as “Grantee” organizations that are willing to locate and work with low and very low income people to finance and construct their own homes.  Generally, these low and very low-income people are below 50% of the area or county’s median income, living in substandard housing.  The Grantee organization maintains a staff of administrative and technical professionals to provide day-to-day technical assistance to participants in the self-help program.  Technical assistance is provided in recruiting participants for the program and assisting them in securing the necessary financing for the purchase of the land and building of their home.    Typically, some 5-8 households work together under the guidance of the “Grantee” to construct their homes once each participant’s loan has been closed.  The “Grantee” organization works with each household on construction material purchase, teaching construction skills to use in building of the home and the coordination of funds disbursement and the mutual effort of all participants to complete each home.

Program participants typically obtain financing for the construction of their homes through the Rural Development field offices of USDA, typically located in a county or District Office for the particular area.  Homes can only be financed in “rural areas” of the 50 States including Puerto Rico, the Pacific territories and the U. S. Virgin Islands.  “Rural area” generally means a place, town, or city with a population of 10,000 or less which is not associated with a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).  In some cases, the population may be between 10,000 to 20,000 if there is a serious lack of mortgage credit and the area is not associated with an MSA.  In addition, some area may meet a special exemption for a population not exceeding 25,000.   There are 47 State Offices nationwide in the Rural Development mission area.  In addition, there are field offices below the State level servicing local area, which will vary from State to State and territories.  State and field offices are responsible for the day-to-day oversight and operation of the Self-Help Technical Assistance Grant program.

(XII)	Type of Procurement: It is anticipated that a negotiated firm-fixed price IDIQ contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider both, an offeror's technical capability and its price. 

(XIII)	 Period of Performance: The period of performance of the proposed contract is anticipated to encompass one base year plus one (1) six month option period.  Work under this contract is expected to commence on or about May 1, 2010.

(XIV)	 Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is an on-line system that is located on the Internet. Prior to ORCA, vendors were required to submit Representations and Certifications (Reps and Certs) for each individual large purchase contract award. Now, using ORCA, a contractor can enter their Reps and Certs information once, for use on all Federal contracts. This site benefits not only the contractor, by the business to maintain an accurate and complete record, but also the Contracting Officer, as he or she can view every record, including archives, with the click of a mouse. The ORCA site can be found by going to http://www.bpn.gov and clicking on "Online Reps and Certs Application" on the left side of the screen. If you do not have access to the Internet, or feel you need extra Internet help, please contact the Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) www.dla.mil/db/procurem.htm) closest to you. You are strongly encouraged to register in ORCA in responding to this solicitation. You are required to have an active registration in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to conduct business with the Federal Government. 

(XV)	 Proposed Solicitation Issue Date: 1 February 2010

(XVI)	 Proposal due date is approximately 1March 2010; actual date will be established at the time final solicitation documents are posted.

(XVII)	 This is a negotiated performance based -best value procurement. Best value method will be used to determine awardees. Evaluation factors will consist of: (i) Technical Capability (ii) Sub-Contracting Plan (iii) Past Performance and (iv) Total Evaluated Price (inclusive of option periods). 

It is the policy of the Government to provide, to the maximum extent practicable, opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Central Contractor Registration's (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories. 

All solicitation documents will be posted to the web via FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov). FedBizOpps provides secure access to acquisition-related information, synopsis, pre-solicitation notices and amendments. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer whose name appears herein. All responsive offers will be considered.

This is not a solicitation for proposals.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI.  Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. <BR><BR>BACKGROUND:<BR><BR>Chemical Biological Medical Systems  Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (CBMS-JVAP) is the DoD organization responsible for developing, producing and stockpiling FDA-licensed vaccine systems to protect the Warfighter from biological agents. The current CBMS-JVAP portfolio includes vaccines at varying stages of clinical development in addition to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed vaccines. <BR><BR>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<BR><BR>CBMS-JVAP has a new requirement for a pre-exposure prophylaxis filovirus vaccine that provides balanced onset and duration of protection for administration to healthy individuals.  The vaccine must provide broad spectrum protection against exposure to multiple species of the Ebola and Marburg viruses.  Because of the incidence of natural occurrence, this vaccine will likely be developed under the Animal Rule. <BR><BR>The primary objective of issuing this RFI is to gather information that will assist in determining a suitable contract solution that efficiently, effectively, and economically provides and maintains a high standard for CBRN medical countermeasure advanced development, manufacture, and production to meet DoDs objectives. <BR><BR>CBMS-JVAP is seeking companies with experience and the capability to develop, manufacture and produce a vaccine to protect against exposure to multiple species of Ebola and Marburg viruses.  This includes both companies that own or have access to Intellectual property (IP) for filovirus vaccines and companies that do not own or have access  to IP.  Specific functional capabilities include, but are not limited to, (1) program management of technically complex efforts to include partnering or subcontracting with innovative companies, (2) integration of multiple functional disciplines, (3) technical expertise in pharmaceutical product development, (4) regulatory interactions with the FDA leading to product approval/licensure under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or Section 351 under the Public Health Service Act, and (5)  experience with product development under 21 CFR 314 Subpart I or 601 Subpart H (i.e. Animal Rule) is desired.<BR><BR>As such, the Government is researching information on current industry capabilities and interest via responses to the questions below:<BR><BR>A.	Describe your companys experience working with the FDA and engaging in meetings and completing submissions to the FDA.<BR>B.	Describe your companys product(s) taken to FDA Licensure, including product type. Examples include small molecule therapeutic, large molecule therapeutic, vaccine, etc.<BR>C.

<DESC>Introduction:This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment,implied or otherwise, that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) willtake procurement action in this matter. Further, neither NASA nor the Government will beresponsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.This RFI is a follow-up to RFI Reference # NNH09OI001L; Space Shuttle Orbiter and SpaceShuttle Main Engine Placement, dated December 17, 2008. NASA recognizes the interest by educational institutions, science museums, and otherappropriate organizations in the acquisition of NASA Shuttle-related property followingthe last flight of the Space Shuttle. While NASAs priority is flying the remainingShuttle missions safely, because of the quantity, complexity, and dispersion of the SpaceShuttle Program (SSP) assets, successful Space Shuttle transition and retirement requirescareful planning prior to program completion, currently scheduled for September 2010. This RFI is being used to gather additional research for NASA to make decisions regardingplacement of Space Shuttle Orbiters and public display after conclusion of the SSP. Inlight of proposed cost and schedule changes associated with the acquisition and displayof the Orbiters, NASA is seeking updated information from educational institutions,science museums, and other appropriate organizations about the communitys ability toacquire and display a Space Shuttle Orbiter after the vehicles are retired from flightstatus.Changes to Orbiter Transfer Cost and Schedule addressed in this RFI:1.	A recipient will be required to take delivery of an Orbiter between July andDecember 2011, six months earlier than the May 2012 date included in the December, 2008RFI.  The first Orbiter is scheduled to be delivered in July 2011, with the otherOrbiter(s) to follow later.2.	A suitable climate-controlled indoor facility must be available to house theOrbiter when delivered.  3.	The cost to complete display preparation for each Orbiter and ferry the Orbiterto its ultimate display location is updated to $28.8 million. This cost is to be providedto NASA.  The $28.8M cost includes the cost to ferry each Orbiter to its ultimatedestination.  A recipient will be required to demonstrate to NASA that the recipientpossesses the full display preparation and ferrying cost no later than April, 2011. NASAwill no longer require that recipients fund safing of the Orbiters.  The December, 2008RFI anticipated that the recipient of the Orbiter would be responsible for funding safingcosts.4.	NASA may also have the opportunity to place an unflown Orbiter for display inaddition to the two retired Orbiters discussed in the Original RFI.5.	This RFI does not address Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs).  NASA does not planto include three installed SSMEs with each Orbiter.NASA is interested in identifying whether potential recipient organizations are capableof bearing the full cost of Space Shuttle Orbiter final display preparation andtransportation/ferry flight. NASA will bear the cost of Orbiter safing which includesdecontamination of hypergolic fuel systems and removal of other safety and environmentalhazards from the vehicles. Organizations interested in receiving a Space Shuttle Orbiterfor public display must be prepared to raise all funding for Space Shuttle Orbiter finaldisplay preparation, and transportation/ferry services. Organizations that ultimatelyreceive an Orbiter will be responsible for all display preparation andtransportation/ferry flight costs.NASA will use the results of this RFI to determine interest that may lead to selection ofspecific organizations to receive a Space Shuttle Orbiter. The Orbiters may be directlytransferred or donated to eligible recipient organizations, if any. Background:NASA will cease SSP operations at all locations following completion of the last flight,currently scheduled to occur in September, 2010. The Government may elect to change thescheduled date for last flight: that would change the scheduled date an Orbiter isavailable for transfer to a recipient. SSP retirement necessitates the disposition of allSSP assets and items no longer required by NASA, including the Space Shuttle Orbiters. The NASA Authorization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-422) directs NASA to submit to Congress aplan describing the process for the disposition of the remaining Orbiters and other SpaceShuttle program-related hardware after the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet. NASAadvised the Congress and has had subsequent discussions with the Smithsonian Institution,National Air and Space Museum regarding accession of a flown Space Shuttle Orbiter to thenational collection. The National Air and Space Museum houses the national collection ofaerospace artifacts. NASA also advised the Congress that the Agency would issue an RFI togauge the level and scope of interest of U.S. organizations in acquiring the two (2)other Orbiters and other major flight hardware (such as the SSMEs) for public displayonce NASAs programmatic requirements for the assets have been satisfied.SSP Hardware Addressed in this RFI:Space Shuttle OrbitersNASAs Space Shuttle Orbiters (Figure 1) are the first reusable spacecraft capable ofroutinely launching into orbit like rockets and then returning to Earth as gliders. Theseunique crew and heavy cargo-carrying vehicles are the main element of the National SpaceTransportation System that has been the mainstay of the U.S. human spaceflight programfor more than a quarter-century. The Space Shuttle Orbiters have and continue to performa wide variety of scientific research and space operations missions, including the finalassembly of the International Space Station.Due to the significance of the Space Shuttle Orbiters and the role they have played inthe Nations space program, special attention will be paid to ensuring they will retireto appropriate places. NASA is keenly aware of the essential value of these key assets tothe space programs rich history; the Agency is therefore committed to making placementdecisions that are determined to be in the best interest of the American taxpayer.Under NASAs current plan, the Orbiter Discovery is to transfer to the National Air andSpace Museum. Endeavour or Atlantis will be available for placement no earlier than July,2011. The other Orbiter will be available before the end of December, 2011, and NASAintends that ferry flights will be completed no later than December, 2011.NASA estimates the total cost to be incurred by a recipient organization for Orbiterdisplay preparation, and delivery by ferry flight to a U.S. destination airport atapproximately $28.8 million. This includes the cost to air ferry the Orbiter by ShuttleCarrier Aircraft from the Kennedy Space Center to a U. S. destination airport. Thisestimate is based on updated estimates by NASA about the minimum tasks which must beperformed for public display of each Space Shuttle Orbiter. It does not take into accountspecial measures that may be required in specific situations such as transporting theOrbiter long distances over public roadways which may require removal of light posts andtraffic signals or transport by barge over water. Additional preparation tasks such asfabrication of engine bay covers or mock nozzles, open payload bay door displayconfiguration, and lighting on the vehicle would also increase costs to recipients. TheOrbiters will not be disassembled for transportation or storage.  Special Considerations:It should be noted that the organizations that ultimately receive a Space Shuttle Orbitermust abide by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) restrictions placed onthe items. The Orbiters fall under the purview of the U.S. Munitions List (USML), asdefined in the ITAR (22 CFR120-130) and are export controlled. The Space Shuttle Orbitersshall not be transferred to foreign persons (ITAR 120.16), in the U.S. or abroad, orexported out of the U.S., without notification to NASA and the specific approval/exportlicense from the Department of State Directorate for Defense Trade Controls(http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/		). Violations of these regulations are punishableby fine, imprisonment, or both.Air ferry of Orbiters by Shuttle Carrier Aircraft would require U. S. destinationairports to have 8,000 to 10,000 feet runways depending on the altitude and atmospherictemperature of the landing site, and the final weight of the Orbiters being delivered.The Space Shuttle Orbiters may not be displayed or stored outdoors. Responders should beaware that the Orbiters will require suitable climate-controlled indoor display orstorage space.Respondents should take into consideration that the Orbiters may contain hazardousmaterials and require proper handling. Although NASA will take necessary precautions todecontaminate the hardware and remove or render safe known safety and environmentalhazards, it may not be possible to completely remove all residual hazards from thehardware. NASA will clearly identify any unusual hazards that are not removed, prior totransferring the Orbiters to final recipient organizations.There is a limited quantity of support items and tools that may be necessary totransport, assemble, and display the Space Shuttle Orbiters. Loan of support items andtools would be negotiated and coordinated with the recipient organizations, contingent onNASA program requirements.Responding to this RFI:Organizations responding to this RFI must be: 1) a U.S. museum, institution, ororganization dedicated to education or educational outreach, including NASA VisitorCenters; 2) a U.S. Federal agency, State, Commonwealth, or U.S. possession or anymunicipal corporation or political subdivision thereof; or 3) the District of Columbia.Note: At a minimum, if you previously responded to NASAs 2008 RFI Reference #NNH09OI001L, Space Shuttle Orbiter and Space Shuttle Main Engine Placement, pleaseacknowledge your intent and ability to satisfy items 1-4 addressed in the sectionentitled Changes to Orbiter Transfer Cost and Schedule addressed in this RFI.  If youwish to provide updated or new information in response to this RFI, NASA requests thatyou provide only the updated or new information with appropriate references, ifnecessary, to your response to the December, 2008 RFI.RFI responses must include:Name of the primary point of contact for the responseAcademic faculty or business titleInstitution or organization affiliationEmail addressPhoneIdentification of other key individuals who collaborated on the RFI responseA brief summary (300 word limit) description of previous relevant experience indisplaying assets of National significance.RFI Questions:NASA is requesting responses to the following questions:1.

<SUBJECT>Computational Photography Project for Pill Identification (C3PI) Program
<SOLNBR>10-057-CYC
<RESPDATE>030210
<CONTACT>Cara Calimano, Email cc436e@nih.gov
<DESC>This project is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the act.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Information (RFI) and a separate written solicitation WILL be issued. The solicitation number is RFI No. NLM-10-057-CYC. This acquisition is not a small business set-aside and the NAICS Code is 541990.<br />In a national effort to promote patient safety, NLM proposes to create an authoritative, comprehensive, public digital image inventory of the nation's commercial prescription solid dose medications. Our current effort is a continuation and extension of our previous project providing the Veterans Administration with a complete digital photographic catalog of the VA Centralized Mail Order Pharmacy formulary for prescription tablets and capsules.<br />We intend to create a collection of digital photographs of prescription tablets and capsules, acquiring the images through a Simplified Acquisition Procedure. This will be an award to a contractor or vendor who will be responsible for acquiring the sample medications, creating high resolution digital photographs of the front (obverse) and back (reverse) surfaces of the samples using conventional techniques for color management, confirming that the images match the description of the medication, developing and matching the images of the samples to relevant metadata (including size descriptions, dimensions, color, and the provenance of the sample), and transmitting those data (images and metadata) to the National Library of Medicine. We believe that there are between 5,000 and 32,000 prescription solid-dose oral medications to be cataloged through this process.<br />The resulting digital image collection from this effort will be placed by NLM in the public domain. The impact of this collection will target patient safety including assisting in drug identification for poison control hotlines as well as online services for the public and nursing care professionals to confirm the identification of a drug to help prevent mistakes in medication. Other uses of the image collection include education and applications in pharmacy pedagogy such as its inclusion in textbooks and digital teaching materials. These applications demand high resolution, high quality images with good color reproduction to faithfully represent the medications through imagery. Smaller images and subsets of the collection can be generated from the original high-resolution data for other applications that do not require the same level of fidelity; however, we are committed to acquiring the best data possible through this mechanism.<br />NLM intends to identify a contractor or assemble a contractor-and-subcontractor team to address these issues, with the emphasis on experienced digital macro-photography talent as well as credentials and experience necessary to safely handle oral solid-dose prescription medications. The matching of the images to the correct identification of the medications is at least as critical as the dispensing of the medications to patients for treatment in that the impact of a mis-identification could have grave consequences. The need for quality control and verification in this project is likely to be significantly higher since the distribution of the resulting data could have widespread public impact, both a positive one if the collection is comprehensive and detailed, and significant negative impacts if there are errors in the database. The contractor should have clear explicit procedures for verifying the data and its correct correspondence to the medications from which it was derived. NLM expects the final team to incorporate photographers, assistants familiar with the handling of pharmaceuticals, a pharmacist for the appropriate qualifications in receiving, handling, and disposing of prescription medications, administrative technicians for the verification and electronic delivery of the digital images and their associated data, and information technology support for image processing, the extraction metadata, and technical support of the digital camera, its software, data storage and backup, as well as internet support to enable the electronic delivery of the digital data.<br />A possible by product of this first award would be a test data collection for the advancement of automatic pharmaceutical identification through computer vision from photographic data. NLM expects to promote computer vision research applied to the domain of content-based information retrieval (CBIR) of solid-dose pharmaceuticals, and anticipates the need for generating a test environment, including variations of photographs of the same drug or sample under different environments. We invite ideas and plans for the structure for such a test collection subset of the overall imaging effort including a discussion of issues such as: (1) the number of validated sample images needed to evaluate automated drug identification algorithms, (2) the different photographic conditions and equipment necessary to effectively support a test image collection, and (3) a plan for deploying and maintaining such a collection in support of a grand challenge or other mechanism for promoting computer vision for solid-dose pharmaceutical identification. This side project would be part of the technical evaluation for the entire award, but would be exercised as a possible option to the primary project.<br />We anticipate that this first award will encompass the acquisition, photography, and the electronic delivery of the resulting digital data of between 4,500 and 6,000 prescription medications. Proposals addressing this requirement should not surpass 1 year in duration. Up to four (4) options for additional services (the additional acquisition of images of pharmaceutical samples in lots of 6,000 samples) should be provided by teams responding to this requirement.<br />A supplemental project may be awarded as an option to create a test data collection from the digital images that are correctly identified to promote computer vision algorithms for the automatic and rapid identification of solid-dose pharmaceuticals. The images in the test data collection will likely include digital photographs of the solid-dose pharmaceutical samples under a variety of lighting conditions and across a diversity of equipment but correctly identified and correlated with the same samples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />The review and award process will follow a two-step process:<br />A Request for Information (RFI) - Search for Sources will be conducted: Any offeror or group wishing to participate in the competition process MUST reply to the search for sources. Potential sources for this work will be asked for examples of their previous work and statements of their capabilities to meet the challenges posed by this project. If a substantial number of contractors respond to this RFI, NLM may use a Technical Evaluation Group (TEG) to evaluate the potential sources on their existing facilities, technical approach, capabilities for the acquisition and disposal of samples, expertise of available personnel, consultants, and subcontractors (including photographers, computer scientists, image processors, pharmacists, and technicians), and past performance. NIH personnel reserve the right to visit potential sites as part of the search for sources; however, a site visit is not required for a future award.<br />A Request for Quotes (RFQ) will be issued for a photographic collection. Only sources identified as competitive through the search for sources will be solicited for quotes for the competition. A complete Special Emphasis Panel (SEP) will be convened to make the award including any options to the contract or purchase order. These/this award(s) will be executed quickly through a Simplified Acquisitions Mechanism under FAR Part 13.<br />Response to the Search for Sources:<br />NLM will review the responses to the search for sources based on an evaluation of the responder's capabilities to execute both the expected photographic collection as well as the optional creation of the computer vision test data set. Responses to the Request for Information (RFI) that constitutes the search for sources will evaluate:<br />Proposed methods for acquiring the data: The response will be evaluated based on the overall technique. A complete proposal is not required, but rather an overview of the proposed method. How does the potential contractor plan to acquire sample medications? How will the contractor ensure that all images are properly identified with the correct medication? How will they process the image data for color management, size accuracy, and background removal?<br />Qualifications of existing personnel: The response will be evaluated based on the technical merits of the named existing personnel. Do they have experience in digital photography? Do they have expertise in managing digital images for record photography, curatorship, or some other related enterprise?<br />Existing facilities: Since this award process is not intended to provide funds for new equipment acquisition, the responders should describe their current capabilities for acquiring the data for the proposed photographic collection. If modifications of any equipment is required, the responses should describe the extent of the modifications, what capabilities are possible using the current configurations, and what capabilities will be enabled by proposed changes to the equipment.<br />Past performance: The responses should provide sources for relevant references of past performance in data acquisition.<br />Samples of previous work: The responses should include photographic or digital illustrations and evidence of previous results. These results should demonstrate the capability of the responder to provide the proposed data with accurate identification of the contents of individual images.<br />Page Limit to responses to the RFI:<br />Responses to the RFI search for sources should be limited to 10 pages of textual information (with figures and tables). Additional illustrations, photographs and evidence of results (presented in photographs or digital information) must accompany the response. The total response should not exceed 15 pages (text plus pictures).<br />Due Date:<br />Responses to the search for sources RFI are due on March 2, 2010. Electronic copies of the RFI response are due by the application deadline. In addition to the official electronic submission, two printed copies of the Sources Sought response are required. These printed hard copies should be printed, 3-hole punched, and submitted in binders. NLM anticipates an official deadline for electronic submission by noon (12:00 PM), Tuesday March 2, 2010, with an official deadline for printed hard copy submission by close of business, Friday March 5, 2010. Electronic copies of submissions should be sent via e-mail to the Contracting Specialist, Cara Calimano, at calimac@mail.nlm.nih.gov. The submission may be split into multiple e-mails to accommodate e-mail servers. At the completion of the submission of responses to the Sources Sought RFI, even if only a single e-mail is transmitted, an additional confirmation text-only e-mail should be transmitted, communicating that a complete submission has been sent and detailing the contents of each file and how many separate e-mail files should be expected. Paper copies may be submitted in writing to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 6707 Democracy Blvd. Suite 105, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Cara Calimano, Contract Specialist.<br />Response to the RFQ:<br />NLM will solicit quotes from sources identified through the Sources Sought RFI. You must respond to the RFI to be considered for the award. If the Sources Sought RFI generates a large number of responses, NLM will use a Technical Evaluation Group to determine which offerors will be invited to respond to the RFQ.<br />Technical proposals should cover:<br />(i) Technical details for:<br />Sample Acquisition<br />NLM will prioritize the list of images of samples to be acquired, beginning with the most widely prescribed drugs as well as the those medications that pose a public threat either through abuse or as a poisoning hazard. NLM proposes the use of DailyMed as the source of the initial list of prescription medications (4,676 medications listed as of 10-June-2009)<br />If samples are offered by participating manufacturers or vendors, the contractor will accept these samples as available.<br />The contractor will be responsible for establishing a source of medications and ensuring that their supply chain remains viable through the life of this project.<br />The contractor will establish and maintain procedures that comply with all state and federal regulations for the management, handling, and disposal of prescription medications.<br />Photographic quality<br />The contractor will adhere to image quality guidelines established by the NLM pertaining to issues of: color management (ensuring that the images provided reflect the actual color of the medication), image resolution (Minimum of 6 MPixels for the field including the pharmaceutical sample), file formats, color background (18% grey color background), and fiducial marks for size, color, and white balance. NLM will provide a standard color reference for matching colors in the raw digital images.<br />Quality control and Data transfer<br />The contractor will develop quality control procedures with the NLM for the verification of acceptable images, matching the images with the correct metadata, and data transmission.<br />Images and metadata will be transferred to NLM, subject to verification.<br />Transition plan - project completion<br />After the data collection is firmly established and the period of performance nears its end, the contractor may be required to transfer the program another contractor. The plan should address a process for disclosing all documentation, file formats, database organization, and open-source software. This transition is essential for the long-term sustainability of the project.<br />(ii) Qualifications of key personnel to execute this project.<br />Background expertise - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team as a whole have access to the range of educational backgrounds in macrophotography, in particular in photography for documenting scientific or records of physical samples.<br />Experience - the extent to which the key personnel and the project team include significant experience and expertise in the production workflows for documentation photography.<br />(iii) The commitment and experience of the institution or offeror in building and releasing public data resources for patient safety in pharmaceutical information.<br />(iv) Proposed relevant facilities<br />Page Limit to Technical Proposals in response to the RFQ:<br />The Technical Proposal should include examples digital images of pharmaceutical samples, demonstrating the capabilities of the respondent.

The contractor shall be required to provide all management personnel, materials, and supplies required to perform support and services as detailed in the DRAFT Performance Work Statement; see access instructions below.  The contractor shall be required to interface with other contractors and Government agencies in support of issues dealing with WSOTS in all areas where the contractor is the functional manager.<BR><BR>2.  This is only a Sources Sought Synopsis and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used for a market survey analysis to determine if the contemplated acquisition will be conducted under full and open competition, or as a set-aside pursuant small business set-aside procedures under FAR Part 19 Small Business Programs.  Respondents shall indicate in their responses whether they qualify as a small business under NAICS Code 517919 with a size standard of $25M.<BR><BR>3.  For the purposes of market research, the Government is seeking to understand the capability and capacity of interested firms.  If you are a small business, and if the Government were to set this acquisition aside for small business, you would be required to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting and 13 CFR 125.6 (known as the 50% rule).  Rules on affiliation and joint ventures are at FAR 19.101, 13 CFR 121.103, 13 CFR 124.513 and 13 CFR 125.6.  Under the 50% rule where the preponderance of support is for services, at least 50% of the cost of the contractor performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business prime.  The small business prime contractor must meet this requirement (1) individually, or (2) together with other small business members of a formal joint venture, or (3) together with a small number of small business subcontractors forming an informal joint venture, in which those subcontractors meet the definition of ostensible subcontractor as set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(4).  Team members in such formal and informal joint ventures are exempt from affiliation rules under the conditions set forth in 13 CFR 121.103(h)(3).  There is no limit to the number of other team subcontractors or size status of subcontractors.  <BR><BR>4.  The Government anticipates prohibiting cross-teaming.  Cross-teaming arrangements include a prime offeror participating as a subcontractor/team member with another prime contractor, or subcontractor/team member subcontracting/teaming with more than one prime contractor.  If acquisition is competed full and open then the subcontracting goal will be determined as a percentage of the overall contract value.<BR><BR>5. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from industries responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP.<BR><BR>6.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Ground Transportation and Engineering Systems (GTES) Product Group Directorate, Engineer Systems Program Office (GTES-ES) is examining the feasibility of using an independent Contractor to manage the procurement of tactical fuel and water systems.  These systems receive, store, transfer, and distribute bulk fuel and bulk water to operating forces in the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF). MARCORSYSCOM seeks industry input on Contractor capabilities, competencies and approaches to perform tactical fuel and water systems procurement activities that satisfy Marine Corps requirements.  Currently it is not possible to procure complete systems as a whole.  The current approach requires procurement of each individual component within the system.  MARCORSYSCOM seeks Contractors with an approach to expedite this process.  MARCORSYSCOM procures roughly $15-20 million of tactical fuel and water systems and components each year and is seeking Contractors that will decrease procurement lead time, reduce administrative burdens, and improve kitting of systems.  The intent is to award a five year ID/IQ contract to procure tactical fuel and water systems and components on an as needed basis.  The majority of items procured will be shipped to Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, GA.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is seeking information from all businesses (including service disabled Veteran owned, Veteran owned, women owned, disadvantaged and others) capable of performing the requirement indicated below. In your response please indicate the socioeconomic status of your business. The NAICS code is 323119 with a size standard of 500 employees.  The VA intends to competitively award a contract in spring of 2010 with a base period of one year and four option periods of one year each for a total contract period of performance of five years.The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires a continuation of the current format of the Veterans Identification Card so that Veteran benefit eligibility can be readily established at VA locations as well as access interactive features and utilize new technologies for patient registration and other administrative functions in the near future.  A successor card compliant with the current health industry standards for interactive benefit cards (the Member Benefit Card or MBC) will be issued as part of the Patient Centered Care Initiative (PCC) which will allow Veterans to access their individualized benefit plans through Healthevet and other means on line.  It is essential (since the current contract for VIC card ends in September 28, 2010) that a successor contract for the VIC and the MBC be in place in time.  The VA intends to transition from the VIC card to the MBC in late 2011 to early 2012.   The current Veterans Identification Card (VIC) system was deployed more than five years ago.  Cards will continue to display the veteran's picture by including a 1-inch by 1-inch color picture, use of bar code and magnetic stripe containing key identifying information providing operational efficiencies through use of an external centralized card generation facility.  Future card (MBC) versions will be compliant with WEDI Health Identification Card implementation of the American National Standard, Identification Cards-Health Care Identification Cards, INCITS 284 as revised. INCITS is accredited by ANSI. The standard is an application of International card standards (ISO Standards) to health care applications in the United States. Estimated total volume of cards produced will be approximately 900,000 cards annually.  The volume of cards is variable throughout the year.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requests that interested contractors provide: a capability statement (five pages or less) or other information regarding their ability to satisfy the requirement described; business name; address; Duns number; size classification based on the NAICS size standard of 500 employees; socioeconomic classification; and a point of contact including phone number and email address no later than February 2, 2010.

All information received in response to this RFI that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>I. Description<br /><br />The Air&nbsp;Armament Center Capabilities Integration Directorate Division AAC/XR is requesting information and/or&nbsp;innovative concepts for developing an airborne capability to remotely mark vehicles for identification purposes. A near-term technology is sought for fast implementation; therefore, mature technologies are preferred. Respondent information will be used by the Government to determine the most promising approaches to standoff (line of sight) "tagging," sensing and tracking of the tag, and the art of the possible in meeting desired qualities described below. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to determine corporate interest in demonstrating such systems. From the responses to this RFI, the Air Force will determine the feasibility of hosting demonstrations at Eglin Air Force Base in late summer 2010 and developing a possible acquisition strategy.
<p>Innovative technologies are sought such as hyperspectral and laser or a combination of both for tagging, sensing and tracking to satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Effectiveness: Tags should be readily applied day or night to a variety of commercial or other targeted vehicles, moving and/or stationary and from a host aircraft at a distance of approx. 5 km or greater, and be easily recognized from similar distances.</p>
<p>2. Persistence: Tags should be capable of being sensed and tracked for at least a few hours duration, with a goal of a few days.</p>
<p>3. Inconspicuous: An ideal tag will be unobservable to the unaided eye, but readily detected with a sensor from an airborne platform similar to the one tagging or from a ground sensor.</p>
<p>4. Unique ID: An ideal tag will allow the user to distinguish among multiple similar vehicles with tags, i.e. a different identifiable tag for each.</p>
<p>5. Date/Time: An ideal tag will include a time stamp and/or expiration feature which will allow some idea of the age of a tag under observation, to allow the observer to easily recognize and disregard an old tag which has outlived its usefulness.</p>
<p>6. Platform Compatibility: The tagging system must be compatible with carriage on relatively slow-moving (propeller-driven) aircraft or UAV's. Ideally the tagging system could be easily integrated into the current sensor suite of the platform. Respondents should provide some estimate of the size, volume and weight of proposed systems. Consideration should be given as to how the system would be integrated should it affect the air/flightworthiness and safety of the airframe.</p>
<p>7. Maturity: Any level of maturity will be considered; however, please indicate if the system is available within the next few months for a tower demonstration. Indicate when the technology would be available for military use.</p>
<p>Additionally, the following information is requested (if available) to enable the Government to better evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of the proposed tagging technology:</p>
<p>1. Weather: Provide tagging sensing and tracking capabilities in an all weather environment and identify atmospheric restrictions in rain, fog, and cloud cover.<br />2. Military Utility: Any weaponization analysis/studies of the tagging technology and potential concepts of employment to show performance, effectiveness, and military utility.<br />3. Reliability/Maintainability: Any data on tagging technology reliability and maintainability issues and their potential solutions.</p>
<p>II. Government Information<br /><br />THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs of charges by the Government will arise due to contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information.</p>
<p>AAC/XR uses service contractors in fulfilling its mission requirements, including the review of the technology capabilities solicited in this RFI. Service contracts contain an organizational conflict of interest clause that requires service contractors to protect the data, and prohibits them from using the data for any other purpose than for which it was presented.</p>

This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort. The information you provide may be utilized by the Department of Defense in developing its acquisition strategy, including creation of Initial Capabilities Documents.</p>
<p>Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. Any subsequent actions resulting from the evaluation of the information provided because of this RFI, may be synopsized at a future date. If synopsized, information detailing the specific requirements of this procurement(s) will be included.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI may be classified at the TOP SECRET level or below. Classified responses should be properly marked and packaged. For instructions on submitting classified information contact: Ms Christine Wicker at Christine.Wicker@eglin.af.mil or (850) 883-4925.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), and should not be construed as such a commitment by the U.S. Government. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, and subject to modification.</p>
<p>III. Responses<br /><br />Responses should include information about all relevant and applicable unclassified technologies available within the aforementioned timeframes and based on requested criteria. They should include information about the type of material, hazard classification, physical properties, etc., as described in requirement criteria.</p>
<p>Responses should be single-spaced, 12-point font, with numbered pages, and should not exceed 15 pages in length, including cover page, appendices, tables, and figures. Responses should use the following subject heading: Airborne Hyperspectral Tagging Technology. For electronic submissions, please use either Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF format. Submissions must be properly marked and hand-carried or mailed to the following address:</p>
<p>AAC/XR<br />Attention: John Cserep<br />207 West D. Ave, Bldg. 349, Suite 303<br />Eglin AFB, FL 32542</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement
Timberland Equipment Limited of Woodstock, Ontario, Canada
The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) in Portland Oregon intends to award a sole source fixed-price contract  under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.302-1, other than full and open competition procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedure, for the acquisition of Stiff-Legged Derrick repair and reinstallation for Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge, Newark, CA.  Timberland Equipment Limited is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the East Landing Stiff Legged Derrick and retained all exact OEM specifications pertaining to the Crane.  Timberland Equipment Limited owns the rights to their specifications, which would not be available to a third party. This would result in any repairs or replication of equipment being conducted in a speculative manner, producing a less than optimal result.  Timberland also has the ability for "in-house" sandblasting and galvanizing of the components, which will allow for a higher level quality control.  The estimated value of this acquisition is $220,000.00  Any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the USFWS requirements described herein may submit a response no later than 01/20/2010, by close of business to be considered.  Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via e-mail only.  A determination not to compete the described purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government.  Any questions or comments should be directed to Frank Lee via e-mail at Frank_Lee@fws.gov.

<DESC>RECOVERY – THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  This notice is issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and FAR Subpart 5.705.  

Contract Number SB1341-07-CQ-0016, Task Order Number 69225 was awarded to Merrick and Company of Aurora, CO on July 10, 2009 in the amount of $455,379.00.  

Work under Task Order Number 69225 will develop and deliver a detailed design for the upgrade of the plumbing system of the thermal shield at the NIST/Center for Neutron Research.  The upgrade requires that cooling water be administered by moving it through the shield using a vacuum rather than a positive pump pressure, as in the present mechanical configuration.

Modification T001 shall be executed to extend the period of performance and increase the total value of the contract due to enhancements to the performance capability of the system that were not apparent at the time of award.  These performance enhancements will result in changes to the concept design that was previously developed.

The period of performance shall be changed as follows:
FROM: July 10, 2009 through December 11, 2009;
TO:  July 10, 2009 through April 14, 2010.

The total amount of the Task Order shall be increased by $47,798.00 from $455,379.00 to $503,177.00.

This modification is being executed against a task order awarded on a sole-source basis In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii).  The order was issued in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract and all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC for period of one year under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) to provide the development of access control policy testing tool for the Privilege Management and Data-Level Access Control Pilot Project for the Computer Security Division.

The requirement is a continuous development of the ACPT based on the prototype system.

Based on recent market research, NIST believes that the North Carolina State University is the only source that can satisfy this requirement.  They are the only source that can provide the required expertise, equipment, as well an experienced research team for the development of this project.

NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to the North Carolina State University for one year. However, interested parties that can clearly and unambiguously demonstrate their capability shall respond to this notice and provide written evidence of such capability.  All information received by 3:00 p.m., EST, February 1, 2010 will be considered by the government.  Inquires will only be accepted via email to sandra.shaffner@nist.gov.  A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed acquisition will be based on responses to this notice; such determination is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a bridge order with Staffing and Beyond (Ms. Alice Hajjar), of Frederick, MD on a sole source basis for a period of three months, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).  This procurement is to allow the time necessary to conduct a new competition of these requirements, to have uninterrupted service of the current contractor, Staffing and Beyond, in order to continue to create and maintain NIST Human Resources (HR) Office’s  web pages, including HR program content.  This is crucial in providing up-to-date information to NIST employees in a timely fashion.  This requirement f is unique because NIST is under an Alternative Personnel Management System (APMS).  The rules and regulations under APMS are considerably different than the government-wide HR systems and other pay banding systems.  This sole source determination is based on the Contractor’s unique expert knowledge in the APMS rules and regulations, to include the unique pay and classification structure, in addition to staffing and performance management background and knowledge, which is different than that of other government agencies, including other pay banding systems.  There have been recent and significant modifications to the NIST pay-for-performance system and the incentive awards program that need to be incorporated into the HR website immediately, thus it is vital that this contract be uninterrupted; therefore, justifying NIST’s need for continued services until a new competitive process is completed.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA FA8773-04-H-5001-0003 . <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.

1.  Completed SF 1449, Addendum to Section B, or acceptable alternative.  Prices quoted will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness, and realism.  Realism will be used to identify quotes which are unusually low and which therefore indicate a potential misunderstanding of the solicitations requirements, or which increase the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.
2.  Past Performance  Information which evidences the level of quality in which the Contractor has performed prior similar contracts.  Based on the quotes received, the Government may contact some, all, or none of the references provided.  A vendors level of past performance may be evaluated solely on the information provided by that vendor.

a.	 Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offerors proposal and data obtained from other sources.  However, the burden of providing thorough, complete, and current past performance information as requested in this paragraph remains the offerors responsibility.  Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the offerors.<BR><BR>b.	The offeror shall ensure that the documentation required in support of Past Performance is supplied by the evaluating agency to the Contracting Officer.  It is the offerors responsibility to follow up with the evaluating customer to ascertain if the required information has been forwarded prior to the established closing date.  The Government will not seek out corrections to incomplete or insufficient information on behalf of offerors.  Unverifiable information will not be considered in the past performance assessment. NOTES:  No Past Performance Survey submittals (mailed, emailed, or faxed) will be accepted from the offeror being evaluated.  The offeror should verify completion and submittal of the forms with the agencies/companies to which they provided the questionnaire.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ).  This solicitation is unrestricted, the NAICS code for this action is 541690 and the business size standard is $7 million.    The Food and Drug Administration intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract for technical writing services for medical meetings using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38, effective December 10, 2009.  
                               STATEMENT OF WORK 
Technical Writing Services for FDA co-sponsored Phenotype Standardization Project Consensus Conference

1.0	Introduction


1.1	Background
The Critical Path Initiative is FDA’s effort to stimulate and facilitate a national effort to modernize the scientific process through which a potential human drug, biological product, or medical device is transformed from a discovery or “proof of concept” into a medical product.  One scientific hurdle on the Critical Path is a lack of understanding of the mechanistic and genetic basis of extremely rare, but serious adverse drug reactions. These reactions, such as drug-induced liver injury, may affect only one patient in several thousand.  The scientific challenge is to discover and validate biomarkers that can identify individuals who are at high risk of developing serious adverse events (SAEs).  This knowledge would lay the scientific groundwork for the development of personalized approaches to treatment that would enhance the safety of drugs by identifying individuals susceptible to specific adverse drug reactions.

The International Serious Adverse Events Consortium (SAEC) is a non-profit consortium actively engaged in research to identify and validate DNA-variants useful in predicting the risk of drug-induced serious adverse events.  The rarity of drug induced serious adverse events and the absence of efficient surveillance/research networks, makes it extremely difficult for any one company/research entity to accrue enough SAE cases and controls to conduct effective whole genome studies and follow on hypothesis driven molecular research.  To date, the SAEC has partnered with “academic investigators” to build a variety of SAE “research cohorts”.  To obtain the research subjects for SAE research in the scale and diversity required, new collaborations with large integrated researcher groups and health networks (with electronic health records) will need to be developed.  In order to expand SAE research in this direction, standardized phenotypes and assessment methods must be developed and published.  To date, the published literature is variable on such definitions and assessment models.
 		
The FDA is co-sponsoring an international conference, to be held in the spring of 2010, to standardize the case definitions of three serious drug-related adverse events (SAEs), serious skin rash (SSR)/acute hypersensitivity syndrome (AHSS), drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and Torsades de Pointes (TdP).  The result of this conference will be standard phenotypic definitions for each of these adverse events which can then be adopted and widely used by the clinical/scientific/biomedical research communities to better standardize research into the genetic basis of SAEs.  The technical writing group will work with three Expert Working Groups to develop technical documents, scholarly articles and decision trees which describe the standard phenotypic definitions for each of the SAEs.
1.2	Objective
The principle objective is to provide medical writing services to the Office of Translational Sciences within the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, to develop a published set of standard phenotypic definitions and associated diagnostic criteria to characterize the clinical features required for the identification of subjects with the following SAEs: Serious skin Rash (SSR)/Acute Hypersensitivity Syndrome (AHSS), Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI), and LQT/Torsades de Pointes (TdP) that will be addressed during the Phenotype standardization project consensus conference . 

1.2.1	The purpose of this procurement is to develop (a) a common format for serious drug-related adverse event case definitions, (b) technical documents with detailed diagnostic criteria and (c) targeted acceptable, which adheres to publishing house standards for each journal and additional information as required for publication in relevant journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine; the American Journal of Cardiology, and the American Journal of Clinical Dermatology,  journals that describe the phenotype standards for each of three (3) serious adverse drug reactions:  
•  Serious Skin Rash (SSR)/Acute Hypersensitivity Syndrome (AHSS)
•  Drug–induced Liver Injury (DILI)
•  LQT/Torsades de Pointes (TdP)

1.2.1.1	Develop algorithm outlining the clinical diagnostic criteria to aid in phenotyping each SAEs identified in Section 1.2
1.2.1.2	Assist the three (3) expert working groups (EWGs), comprised of 4-5 disease experts with representation from the international regulatory agencies European Medicines Association (EMEA) and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW), in developing a common framework for the SAE phenotype definitions and writing draft phenotype definitions for each of the 3 SAE areas described in 1.2.1 prior to the conference in spring 2010.

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR) (FEB 2005)<br /><br />a. Neil Lamartin is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The COTR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the Contractor by a unilateral modification to the Contract. The COTR is located at: 439 West York Street, Norfolk, VA.</p>
<p>b. The responsibilities and limitations of the COTR are as follows:<br />(1) The COTR is responsible for the technical aspects of the project and serves as technical liaison with the Contractor. The COTR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all reports, and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract.<br />(2) The COTR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the Contract price, terms or conditions. Any Contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COTR. No such changes shall be made without the expressed prior authorization of the Contracting Officer (CO). The CO may designate assistant or alternate COTR(s) to act for the COTR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the Contractor. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR<br />SHIP REPAIR (AUGUST 2005)</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule, as follows:</p>
<p>A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be&nbsp;reduced by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar work items.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.232-25 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>
<p>Name and Address of the contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />CLIN/Work Item No., Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>The invoice must include:</p>
<p>a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Ship name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.</p>
<p>Note: When invoicing for growth work, the contractor shall identify it as Growth and shall identify the modification number to which authorization was given and the CLIN/work item that the growth is associated.</p>
<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.</p>
<p>All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration provided all supporting documentation is submitted and validated.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:</p>
<p>Department of Commerce/NOAA<br />Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD)<br />Attn: Robin Resweber<br />200 Granby Street, 8th Floor<br />Norfolk, VA 23510<br />Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER EA133M-10-SU-XXXX (to be assigned upon contract award). &#61618;</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)<br /><br />The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0002) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for this Dockside Availability are listed in Section B. <br /><br />b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:</p>
<p>1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in <br />direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.<br /><br />2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.</p>
<p>3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.</p>
<p>c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0002). The estimated worth of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.</p>
<p>d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.<br /><br />e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0002) and additional material (CLIN 0003) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (DEC 2009) - Alternate II (DEC 2009) applies, and the following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause at paragraph (b) are applicable to this acquisition:<br />(3) 52.203-15, Whistleblower Protections under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Mar 2009)(Section 1553 of Pub.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

Anticipated award date is on or about 27 January 2010. Contact Ryan Suchy at 252-334-5472 or ryan.m.suchy@uscg.mil for questions regarding this solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
      Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>In reply to the question as to why Amendment 00002 was issued changing the acquisition to unrestricted, the following information is provided:<BR>In accordance with FAR Part 19, for acquisitions exceeding $100,000.00, there must be a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns offering the products of different small business concerns.  Based on market research, it has been determined that there are no small business manufacturers of the type and size of container specified in solicitation #W911SG-10-T-0042 and therefore there is not a reasonable expectation of receiving offers from at least two responsible small businesses.  In addition, the SBA has not granted a waiver or exception to the Nonmanufacturer Rule for the relative NAICS.<BR><BR>The time for receipt of quotations is corrected to read 8:00 a.m. Mountain Standard Time (MST).  The due date of January 19, 2010 remains unchanged.<BR>

(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. 
(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five (5) years and six (6) months.<BR><BR>In order to view the attached Scope of Work sellers must visit www.fedbid.com.<BR><BR>SELLER QUESTION #1: Based on our bids today, can you please clarify LI 004 and LI 005 as to whether you are seeking 6 users under 1 license and 5 users under 1 license, or 6 and 5 licenses respectively.
BUYER ANSWER #1:  Per the Program Office, We would like 6 users and 5 users to have independent access and use of the services.  It can be under the same account, as the users are co-located in [the same Division].
SELLER QUESTION 2:  You request separate pricing for "Newswire Distribution" and "unlimted email distribution" (in addition to news monitoring, analysis, etc)...How are you differentiating the technical requirements for "Newswire Distribution" vs. "email distribution?"   Or, do you consider NewsWire Distribution and email distribution to be the same thing?  The reason I ask is that I know of companies other than PR Newswire who offer one or the other, but not both, and I am concerned that you will receive very low-priced bids that claim to provide "newswire distrbution" when in reality it is just email or web-only distribution, NOT an actual AP newswire feed to newsrooms, which the BATF is accustomed to.  Please provide a technical specification or requirement as to how the government will evaluate/determine what is and what is not "Newswire Distribution" so that we can submit the most competitive bid for the BATF for the services required. 
 
BUYER ANSWER 2:  To clarify, newswire distribution is a direct newswire feed to newsrooms (much like the Associated Press feed); ATF news releases would be pushed to news directors or one location in all newsrooms.  The email distribution function is just that; the service needs to push ATF news releases directly to reporters (via email) who cover ATF, law enforcement and criminal matters for news organizations.  The vendor would need to build those email distribution lists, with ATF assistance if necessary.<BR><BR>SELLER QUESTION #3:  Are the users sharing access to the application (e.g. One License/One Account) or are the users required to have their own individual licenses that are unique to each user? BUYER ANSWER #3:  Users can share access to the application.  One license for ATF PAD with multiple, equal users (6) is what we want.  We dont need six unique, customized licenses.
a.      PAD needs at least six staff members to be able to send news releases to the vendor for distribution to newsroom wires services and to specific email distribution lists.
b.      The vendor would need to build news media email distribution lists so that news release dissemination is targeted to reporters who cover ATF, law enforcement and criminal matters.

SELLER QUESTION #4:  Regarding LI 005, Does the client want broadcast content (e.g. video and text) within the News Clipping Service or only print and online sources? 
BUYER ANSWER #4:  PAD needs the vendor capture news stories that mention ATF (and other key words) in print and online sources, to include broadcast (TV) news outlets.
c.       Many TV news stations and networks publish their broadcasted stories in text form on their company websites.  PAD needs the vendor to clip those stories and provide them daily, along with print (newspaper) articles.
d.      PAD would like to know about the possible and potential costs for providing video content.<BR><BR>

The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.

The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. 
(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. 
(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five (5) years and six (6) months.<BR><BR>In order to view the attached Scope of Work sellers must visit www.fedbid.com.<BR><BR>SELLER QUESTION #1: Based on our bids today, can you please clarify LI 004 and LI 005 as to whether you are seeking 6 users under 1 license and 5 users under 1 license, or 6 and 5 licenses respectively.
BUYER ANSWER #1:  Per the Program Office, We would like 6 users and 5 users to have independent access and use of the services.  It can be under the same account, as the users are co-located in [the same Division].
SELLER QUESTION 2:  You request separate pricing for "Newswire Distribution" and "unlimted email distribution" (in addition to news monitoring, analysis, etc)...How are you differentiating the technical requirements for "Newswire Distribution" vs. "email distribution?"   Or, do you consider NewsWire Distribution and email distribution to be the same thing?  The reason I ask is that I know of companies other than PR Newswire who offer one or the other, but not both, and I am concerned that you will receive very low-priced bids that claim to provide "newswire distrbution" when in reality it is just email or web-only distribution, NOT an actual AP newswire feed to newsrooms, which the BATF is accustomed to.  Please provide a technical specification or requirement as to how the government will evaluate/determine what is and what is not "Newswire Distribution" so that we can submit the most competitive bid for the BATF for the services required. 
 
BUYER ANSWER 2:  To clarify, newswire distribution is a direct newswire feed to newsrooms (much like the Associated Press feed); ATF news releases would be pushed to news directors or one location in all newsrooms.  The email distribution function is just that; the service needs to push ATF news releases directly to reporters (via email) who cover ATF, law enforcement and criminal matters for news organizations.  The vendor would need to build those email distribution lists, with ATF assistance if necessary.<BR><BR>SELLER QUESTION #3:  Are the users sharing access to the application (e.g. One License/One Account) or are the users required to have their own individual licenses that are unique to each user? BUYER ANSWER #3:  Users can share access to the application.  One license for ATF PAD with multiple, equal users (6) is what we want.  We dont need six unique, customized licenses.
a.      PAD needs at least six staff members to be able to send news releases to the vendor for distribution to newsroom wires services and to specific email distribution lists.
b.      The vendor would need to build news media email distribution lists so that news release dissemination is targeted to reporters who cover ATF, law enforcement and criminal matters.

SELLER QUESTION #4:  Regarding LI 005, Does the client want broadcast content (e.g. video and text) within the News Clipping Service or only print and online sources? 
BUYER ANSWER #4:  PAD needs the vendor capture news stories that mention ATF (and other key words) in print and online sources, to include broadcast (TV) news outlets.
c.       Many TV news stations and networks publish their broadcasted stories in text form on their company websites.  PAD needs the vendor to clip those stories and provide them daily, along with print (newspaper) articles.
d.      PAD would like to know about the possible and potential costs for providing video content.<BR><BR>

I am wondering if thisis acceptable?A: Whatever Teaming Arrangements you make/have are fine; please knowthat we will have privity of contract w/that 1 Vendor.<BR><BR>

<DESC>AMENDMENT #5

The purpose of this amendment is to extend the due date of all Proposal Volumes (I, II, III, IV & V) and all tabs to 16 February 2010. This extension is due to the Government’s clarification of the MiDAESS Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) position (Reference the attached OCI Brief from the 7 Jan. 2010 Pre-proposal Conference) which may have an impact on current teaming arrangements for potential Offerors. The Government desires to maximize competition and to allow industry to re-align their Prime/Sub-contracting teaming arrangements, if necessary, and have adequate time to prepare proposals. Delivery of these proposal volumes shall also be IAW Section L-05.3 and Section L Table L-05-1 as revised by this amendment.

***** Offerors are reminded to review and follow proposal delivery instructions at Section L-06.4. UPS or FedEx delivery to the post office box or Schriever AFB Visitor’s Center is NOT authorized by the Contracting Officer. Delivery to the Schriever AFB Visitor’s Center is HAND DELIVERY ONLY by the Offeror; hand delivery must be coordinated with the Contracting Officer no later than 24 hours in advance of the proposal due date. Hand delivered proposals will ONLY be accepted on the proposal due date, 16 Feb 2010. *****


Offerors are hereby instructed to replace Section L; Section L - Attachment 1, Past Performance Information (PPI); Section L - Attachment 2, Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ); and Section L – Attachment 5, Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Disclosure Form with the amended versions. All revisions in these documents are related to delivery dates only.

Offerors may submit revisions or updates to previously submitted Volume IV Past Performance Tabs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 no later than 16 February 2010, if needed.

Submission of Volume IV Past Performance Tab 3: Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQ) with previous delivery dates is acceptable as the content of the document has not changed. Only the due dates on this document were affected by this amendment.

Note: The Industry Day #3 (Pre-proposal Conference), 7 Jan. 2010 Questions & Answers and Briefing Package were provided as an UPDATE to the Final Offeror’s Library and will not be posted separately to FedBizOpps.

Offerors are required to acknowledge receipt of all amendments by filling in Block 14 of the SF 33. (Reference instructions at Section L-04.8)

<DESC>********************************
EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 18, 2009, THE DEADLINE FOR THE RFP IS EXTENDED. PLEASE SEE MESSAGE BELOW.

This message is sent in regards to the Smithsonian Institution’s RFP for real estate services.  Because interested Offerors submitted almost 80 questions for the RFP, the Smithsonian needs more time to fully answer all of the questions.  In order to give all Offerors a chance to fully digest all of the answers, we are therefore going to be extending the proposal due date.  Amendment No. 1, which will contain the questions and answers to the RFP will be issued by the end of the month, and as of now, the deadline for submission of proposals for RFP F09SOL00066, will be the date that is exactly one week from the date of issuance of Amendment No. 1.

We apologize for the delay, but thank you for your patience.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>Question: Can you consider revising the current BPA to allow for offers to be submitted on a one-year basis (base period only) with the ability for the contractor to re-submit and negotiate pricing with the Portland VA at the start of each option year period?Answer: Due to the volatility of the nuclear medicine industry worldwide, the government is requesting pricing for the base year only. BPA holders will be asked to submit new pricing at the start of each option year period.

Sources Sought/Request for InformationTHIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTETITLE: Parts and Repair Ordering System Services (PROS) IVSources Sought Parts and Repair Ordering System IV (PROS IV) NOTE: 1. INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) at Wright-Patterson AFB OH,  is responsible for providing comprehensive logistic support to approximately 100 foreign partners.  Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403).  Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).   The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners.  North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services.  The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners.  Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts.  The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC.  This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor.  The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed.  It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment.  We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots.  Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: 
Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc)
The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support.   
These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options.  The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars.  
This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government.
Capabilities Package:  All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services.  Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services.  The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.  RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009.  
The PROS Program team will hold an industry day at the Hilton, Garden Inn, 3250 Pentagon Park Boulevard, Beavercreek OH 45431 on Thursday 17 Dec 2009 from 09:00 till 15:00.  We will present a brief overview of the PROS III program followed by open questions.  Points of Contact:  The Contracting Officer for the PROS program is William T. Smith at William.smith4@wpafb.af.mil.  All questions concerning this acquisition must be submitted in writing to the PCO for distribution to the acquisition team.  Do not provide proprietary information in your questions to the contracting officer since all questions and answers will be shared amongst all interested parties.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested sources regarding fielding additional tactical aerial targeting pods/Advanced Targeting Pod Sensors Enhancement (ATP-SE).  The sponsoring activity is Aeronautical Systems Center, 647th Aeronautical System Squadron, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  The ! program office anticipates awarding, on or about 28 FEB 2010, a competitive Firm Fix Priced (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract of five years in length for the production ATP-SE systems.  Total requirement are for an estimated 670 systems, of which approximately 275 new systems are anticipated to be procured via this activity.  The actual quantity will be dependent on requirements, price and available funding.  The ability to handle classified material will be a requirement for award of any contract(s) that may result from this notification.  The purpose of this notification is to determine whether any competitive sources exist and to notify industry of any impending actions so that possible subcontracting opportunities may be pursued.  Any IDIQ Contract resulting from this sources sought synopsis will be to acquire the non-developmental ATP-SE as a follow-on system to the AN/AAQ-33 targeting pod.  The ATP-SE is an external, pylon-mounted targeting pod and will be integrated onto the F-16, F-15, A-10, B-52 and B-1 platforms with the potential for integration onto other military platforms.  The targeting pod is capable of producing infrared and visible imagery of both ground and airborne targets.  The pod provides laser ranging and designation in support of weapon delivery, navigational functions, recording and data-linking of generated imagery and data.  The imagery will allow for greater stand-off ranges and increase target identification.  The Government does not contemplate providing any data or drawings related to the existing targeting pods already in the Government's inventory.  This contract may include activities for both existing and new targeting pods such as providing support equipment, spares an! d product support to include but not limited to: field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software support and integration, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares, provisioning, flight test support, Contractor Logistical Support (CLS), special studies, efforts in support of contingency operations and contractor field team support to include emergency fleet repair support, as well as integration, test, and production and installation of future modifications and enhancements as new technologies become available.   Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed 10 pages addressing the following areas: 1. Capability to meet all technical requirements 2.

This industry day will include an unclassified open session and closed one-on-one sessions to discuss classified requirements.  The closed sessions are reserved for prime contractors only (prime contractors will be allowed to bring team members of their choosing) with the ability to handle classified material whose clearances are verified by the 77th Aeronautical System Wing Security Office.   Further notification and information regarding this industry day will be posted in the near future.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. This is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources, and will be used to determine the basis for any competitive aspects of the acquisition. Accordingly, each respondent is requested to clarify whether any teaming arrangements are contemplated (including Small and Small Disadvantaged Business participation). Based upon receipt of responses and analysis, a determination will be made to ascertain the Government position of other than full and open versus a competitive solicitation. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their size, particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business concern, a minority institution, and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334511 "Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aer! onautical, and Nautical System and Instrument manufacturing" applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 750 employees.

Update: ASC 647 AESS ATP-SE IDIQ TASK ORDER CONTRACT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this update is to reiterate to industry that information about the pending source selection, requirements for ATP-SE, or any other discussions pertaining to the ATP-SE that may occur with industry shall not be considered a requirement or direction unless that information has originated from the PCO, Mr. Robert Hixenbaugh. The ATP-SE team has been made aware of communication between the user and a contractor that may have related perceived requirements specifically "non-developmental ATP-SE system procured as a result of this sources sought synopsis will require a single OFP" This is not a currently planned requirement.  All future requirements for ATP-SE will be released to all potential Offerors through the PCO. If any Offeror believes they have received direction or guidance on the upcoming program it is incumbent upon them to disregard that information/not act upon that information if it has not come from the PCO. This announcement does not relieve the potential offerors from the previous request for submitting the capabilities statements on or before the 16 May deadline.This is not a request for proposal and no response is required.    The PCO shall be the sole POC for any and all communication regarding this acquisition: Kimberly Henderson, (937) 255-7682, email kimberly.henderson@wpafb.af.mil.

CAUTION NOTICE

In the past, most Best Value Clothing and Textile solicitations utilized Best Value Trade Off Procedures, however, This acquisition is utilizing the Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Best Value Method. As such, no "trade off" applies and the Government intends to award to the low priced firm who is compliant with terms of the solicitation, and deemed "technically acceptable."  There will be no  re-submittals for PDM and only firms with satisfactory or better PDMs will be eligible for award. Technical Acceptability is being defined herein as satisfactory, very good or exceptional PDMs. All PDMs will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria outlined in the solicitation. 

From among technically acceptable firms, the Government will then select the lowest price offeror and determine if that firm is responsible, complies with terms and conditions of the solicitation and an award to them is in the best interest of the Government. If that firm fits these criteria, award will be made to them. If not, the Government will review each subsequent technically acceptable low priced offer until one is identified that does meet the criteria, in which case award will be made to that firm.

The Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with a competitive range group of offerors from among technically acceptable firms, based on price. If negotiations are conducted, award will be made to low priced offer (based on final proposal revision closing, date/time) that is technically acceptable, responsible and compliant with solicitation terms and conditions.

Foley U.S. Federal Courthouse in Spokane, Washington. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.</p>
<p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is a modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Thomas S. Foley Courthouse into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, and lighting) and will also include an expansion and relocation of the United States Marshals Services (USMS) to the second floor of the building. LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards, and United States Marshal Services (USMS) tenant standards/requirements.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/30/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/29/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>TASK ORDER #0012. PROJECT DESCRIPTION:<BR>EN has a need to issue a task order with ARRA funding. The original scope of services is:<BR><BR>The contractor shall conduct two geophysical investigations to characterize groundwater seepage along the right bank of the Jim Woodruff Dam Project.  The investigation shall map subsurface preferential flow paths through the limestone foundation material.  The survey shall be conducted by energizing the groundwater with a signature alternating electric current, and then measuring the magnetic field generated at the surface using a sensitive magnetic receiver.  Each investigation shall be conducted in two phases.  The initial phase shall consist of collecting magnetic readings on a course grid pattern (approximately 20 meters by 40 meters), in order to identify anomalies areas.  The second phase shall consist of collecting more magnetic readings tighter grid spacing in the anomalous areas, so as to closely map groundwater flow paths.  <BR><BR>The task order will increase the area of the geophysical investigation to include the left bank area of the Jim Woodruff Dam Project.  This task order is required to help map potential seepage paths under the spillway and earthen dam.<BR><BR>

<p>Requirement competed In accordance with FAR8.404(a)(1), under E-buy RFQ# 428976<br />BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION<br />In accordance with 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />(a) Authority. <br />(1)Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Justification for Brand Name sole source purchase of Solo ME6 6 oz cups and DS306 tab lids for the gypsy moth rearing facility at the Otis Laboratory</p>
<p>The Otis Laboratory (USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Services, Plant Protection Quarantine - PPQ, Center for Plant Health Science and Technology - CPHST) has been using the combination of the Sweetheart OZ6X polystyrene plastic cup and DS306-04000 paper tab lid for the mass rearing of gypsy moth larvae since the late 1970s. This cup-lid combination was selected after numerous scientific studies were conducted with all containers and lids available at that time. That combination of cup and lid provided the optimum rearing environment for the production of healthy gypsy moth life stages. These life stages are used by PPQ researchers to develop techniques for use in managing the gypsy moth population in the United States. Our mass rearing facility also supplies gypsy moth life stages to state, university, and foreign researchers.</p>
<p>The manufacturer (previously Sweetheart, now Solo) recently discontinued the OZ6X cup which had fluted sides, but the replacement cup (Solo ME6) is similar except it does not have fluted sides, and it fits the DS306 paper tab lid which is still manufactured. The cups and lids must be able to be used in the mass rearing equipment at the facility, and must provide the proper environment necessary for healthy development of gypsy moths. The slightest change in cup or lid material, shape, or construction can alter the way the cup interacts with the diet, the humidity inside the cup, the level of air movement into the cup, the space between the diet and the lid that larvae have for development, the fit of the lid preventing larval escapes, the stability of the cup not to tip, the transparency needed to monitor health of developing larvae without opening cups, and the strength of the cup not to collapse under the weight of trays of cups stacked above them.</p>
<p>PPQ recently evaluated the new product as well as 4 other similar cups that are currently available. Solo SD5, Solo SDL58, Sweetheart 5 FL OZ 5, and Sweetheart 5 FL OZ 12. No other cups other than Solo or Sweetheart have been tested so far. Although these cups are very similar to the cups we are ordering, because of inadequate transparency, slight differences in shape, volume, and/or the way the lids fit, they could not be used for mass rearing gypsy moth. The Solo ME6 cup passed these qualifications. PPQ further tested the Solo ME6 by rearing gypsy moths in them and allowing them to develop from egg to adult. The gypsy moths developed normally, during this developmental period. They have not tested whether those adults could reproduce and have viable offspring because that would take a minimum of 14 months to determine, and the current supply of cups is near its end. However, other insectaries have utilized this cup for rearing gypsy moth successfully over multiple generations. This cup is designed for food storage and to be resistant to fats, oils, and temperatures from 0 to 180 F, which is necessary since it contains diet that is poured in while hot.</p>

The Early Head Start (EHS) program was started in 1995, thirty years after the first Head Start preschool programs were funded, to serve pregnant women, infants, and toddlers through the provision of early, continuous, intensive and comprehensive child development and family support services.  As a part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) (ARRA), OHS received dollars for the sole purpose of serving additional pregnant women, infants and toddlers in its Early Head Start program. The purpose of this contract is to develop criteria, recruit, train,  and maintain a database of approximately 120 Infant and Toddler consultants who will serve as Start-Up Planners to many of the 600 newly awarded Early Head Start programs. Start-up planners are an allowable use of Head Start funds. A start-up planner is a consultant, hired by the program, to help facilitate the program’s start-up team through the process of planning and preparing for the implementation of Early Head Start services.  The current ARRA-funded expansion of Early Head Start grantees, the first since 2002, will nearly double the number of EHS programs serving pregnant women, infants and toddlers. This task order will purchase services to train a new cadre of consultants to support the effective and rapid start up of most of the new programs.

Rationale in support of citation in Paragraph 4 above: a.	Description of contractor and or of acquisition action that demonstrates that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited: 	The estimated dollar amount is: (1) over the SAP Threshold; (2) under $5 Million; and (3) under the SBA Small Business Threshold of $7.0 Million.  On that basis, this requirement is being solicited as a SDVOSB Sole-Source as authorized by the "Veterans First" Contracting Program (Ref: IL 049-07-08, 38 U.S.C. 8127).b.

Additional Support for the use of other than full and open competition: a. Explanation of why technical data, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work or purchase descriptions suitable for full open and competition have not been developed or are not available: 	NAb. When the sole source exception is used in the case of a follow-on acquisition, provide an estimate of the cost that would be duplicated and describe how the estimate was derived if the contract is awarded to other than the incumbent: 	N/Ac.
