<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate a firm fixed price contract on a non-competitive basis to the incumbent Bellsouth. The VA Medical Center, Augusta, Georgia intends to enter in negotiations with Bellsouth to provide Maintenance and Repair of Government owned Telephone Systems, Microvwave/T-1, Public Address, Call Accounting System and all other peripheral equipment. Under the authority source of title 41 U.S.C. 253=A9 (1) and FAR 6.302.  Currently the VA is in the process of procuring new Phone Switches. The VA will begin implementation of Phone Switches in FY 2003. Bellsouth has maintained the Telephone System in Augusta since 1983. It would be detrimental to the Medical Center to change maintenance providers for a one (1) year period.  A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement is based on the sensitivity of this Telephone System and Bellsouth knowledge of our systems and their connectivity. Bellsouth staff are trained and experienced on this equipment and is the only source of this particular service that has been identified as compatible to the existing system and the only company servicing this facility. The use of sole source procurement is the most advantageous method of fulfilling the Government=92s requirements with minimum interruption and down time as the implementation of new Phone Switches or provided.  Subsequent information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This decision is solely within the discretion of the Government. Sole source acquisition document will be issued on September 03, 2002. NAICS: 811219.

<DESC>The Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Operations Office (NNSA/NV) intends to solicitate and negotiate with only one source -- Fluid Tech Inc, 5720 Arville Street, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89113 -- to assess, plan and prepare the Engine Maintenance, Assembly and Disassembly (EMAD) Facility, Area 25 at the Nevada Test Site (NTS), for waste processing operations involving a mobile in-container vitrification (ICV) process. This will entail preparing a RCRA Part B Permit for TRU/MTRU waste processing at the EMAD facility; assessing the EMAD facility for its capability to support this process, prioritizing the actions needed to prepare for and accept the ICV equipment, and initiating the improvements/modifications needed to support the ICV process; planning and engineering for operation of the mobile vitrification process; developing a preliminary review for the contractor to become a certified generator for disposing of radiological waste at the NTS; acquiring security clearances for appropriate staff to handle classified radioactive material and information; and identifying and evaluating sources for soil and refractory materials to be used in the ICV process.  Completion of these tasks will provide information on a path forward for final disposition of oversize boxes of TRU waste and classified transuranic material currently stored at the NTS.  This waste cannot be removed from the NTS.  The NNSA/NV has a requirement to meet regulatory deadlines imposed by the state of NV.  There is no path forward for the material under existing rules and regulations governing the final disposition of this material.  NNSA/NV intends to award a sole source contract to Fluid Tech, Inc., Las Vegas, NV, as Fluid Tech possesses a State/NRC-license to operate the EMAD facility and they are the lease holder of the EMAD facility.  The EMAD facility is the only facility at the NTS suitable for performing this work.  Obtaining the State/NRC-licensing process typically takes approximately 3 years.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source and no other services will satisfy this agency requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to negotiate a sole source Purchase with National Association of Regional Councils (NARC) to promote Safety Conscious through regional councils.  NARC is the leading national alliance for fostering regional cooperation and building regional communities.  Regional councils of government--more than 450 of them across the nation--are multipurpose, multi-jurisdictional, public organizations. Created by local governments to respond to federal and state programs, regional councils bring together participants at multiple levels of government to foster regional cooperation, planning and service delivery.  NARC provides training and technical assistance on the latest regional developments, conducts research on timely regional topics, and promotes regional cooperation through its conferences and publications.  NARC offers a multi-disciplinary approach to safety conscious planning.  NARC not only works with transportation agencies but also with other agencies that deal with education, labor development, health, human, child and elderly services, etc.  NARC will leverage their expertise and resources in other areas to strengthen safety conscious planning.  As a non-profit organization, their members will donate their time and expertise to support activities.  NARC and its members are in a unique position to effectively integrate different disciplines, approaches and points of views for better safety conscious planning.  Safety Conscious Planning efforts will take advantage of NARC?s membership and their other current activities in order to best target local and regional government entities.  The result of this effort will be both improved transportation safety and an enhanced transportation planning process that can better provide a more comprehensive evaluation alternative to decision makers.  Because NARC provides training and technical assistance on the latest regional developments, conducts research on timely regional topics, and promotes regional cooperation through its conferences and publications in addition to donating their time and expertise to support these activities, they are the only known source that can successfully complete the Safety Conscious Planning Project.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the threshold is $100,000.  The anticipated award date is September 26, 2002.

<DESC>NA The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center intends to procure on a non-competitive basis, through Simplified Acquisition procedures for contractor support in assessing and analyzing the groundwater data obtained from the Motorwheel Superfund site.

The Government requires a method that incorporates time sequence of measurements, both spatial and temporal, and uses existing site groundwater models.    The only known source that meets the requirements is Subterranean Research Inc. which uses a proprietary time-varying Bayesian filter to retain the key features of conventiona l statistical methods while overcoming obstacles, such as managing the rapidly growing size of covariances leading to substantial computing problems. Small Business firms classified under NAICS Code 562910 that are interested in responding must demonstrate in writing within 15 days from the date of this synopsis that they can meet the requirements specified above.  This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority 6.302.

The following sources have been approved for this acquisition as follows: General Electric Company, TRI/Industries, Flameco Engineering Inc, and Turbocombustor Technology Inc.   All responsible sources solicited may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.   It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center of Cancer Research, Neuro Oncology Branch (NOB), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Spectral Genomics, Inc., 8080 NorthStadium Drive, Houston, TX 77054 100 Special Analysis - Single Kit Genomic Profiling (2-4Mb) Kits used to conduct large-scale gene expression analysis of thousands of human glioma tissues using microarray.  Genomic profiling is the technique of looking at copy changes across the entire chromosome and performing a linear plot across the chromosome in a Megabase resolution. This is very similar to "expression profiling" whereby one would line up genes from any particular region of the genome and look at the change of the number of copies at each position of each gene.  In the case of genomic analysis it is referred to as "genomic profiling".  Spectral Genomics arrays make use of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) which can be used in the cloning of large DNA fragments, on average approximately 200kb long, and has been used as one of the cloning vectors of choice in the sequencing of the human and mouse genomes.  Spectral Genomic employs a unique patented approach (Patent #6,048,596) to produce a series of BAC arrays that are ideal for array-based genome profiling.  These arrays allow the researcher the capacity to perform the sort of high-resolution genome scans required for the detection of chromosomal imbalances that are common events in most tumors and many congenital abnormalities.  Using Spectral Genomics, BAC arrays will permit the analysis of genomic profiling (CGH) of genes discovered by our microarray studies.  The reagent is essential for the NOB lab to better understand the molecular mechanisms of glioma, discovery of better diagnosis methods and prediction of clinical therapeutic outcomes, e.g., patient survival rate.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 18, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The NAICS Code:541380 and the business size standard is $6.0 million.  No collect calls for faxed copies of capability statements will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Surveillance Research Program (SRP), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, Office of Sponsored Research, 10911 Weyburn Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90024 services to examine the health status, access to and utilization of care for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIAN), categorized into two sub-groups: California Indians and AIAN who live in California but are members from tribes outside of California.  It is an exploratory study to examine, evaluate, and identify priority health, access and utilization needs that are amenable to state policy intervention.  The research tasks will include a secondary analysis of the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS 2001); dissemination activities including a report specifically addressing health status and access to and utilization of care, including policy recommendations; and the development of a capacity building process for an all Native core research team.    The supplies and services herein are being made in accordance with simplified procedures as authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  Contractor shall be responsible for: 1) Establishing an advisory board of 3-5 experts to provide ongoing advice to the overall project, 2) Conducting a secondary analysis of the CHIS, 3) Conducting a Policy Analysis of policy issues amendable to state intervention, 4) Disseminating the results, and 5) Establishing a Native Experts Core Analysis Team.  The contractor shall provide SRP with an initial Progress Report with 90 days after award of the contract and a Final Report at the conclusion of the contract.  Contract period is for one year from date of award.  FAR clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) is applicable to this solicitation.  UCLA Center for Health Policy Research has unique access to both resources and data sources. The analysis will use the CHIS 2001, the largest state-level health survey ever conducted, which was fielded by the same contractor.  Although public use datasets are available for CHIS, the complete dataset is maintained  in-house.   In 2000/2001, the CHIS 2001 randomly surveyed by telephone over 54,000 households throughout the state, focusing on public health and access to health care. CHIS 2001 will provide local-level estimates for counties with populations of 40,000 or more, and statewide estimates for California's overall population and its major ethnic groups.  CHIS is unique in its ability to provide information about AIAN because the survey instrument underwent a cultural and linguistic review and modification process.  AIAN cultural competency training materials were developed for the data collection subcontractor, and these materials were incorporated into the standard interviewer training protocol. The oversample interviewers received in-person training by the proposed PI for this project, Delight E. Satter, with regards to the unique cultural and linguistic issues pertinent when interviewing AIAN people. Lastly, CHIS has the largest sample of AIAN in the history of the US, an unweighted total of 3,042 (2,694 in the RDD - the total number may increase once data processing is complete- and 351 in the oversample).  The race questions in CHIS were specifically designed to avoid the unique data problems faced by other surveys collecting data on AIAN.  Persons who answered as American Indian or Alaska Native on any of the race questions were further asked to identify their tribal heritage and whether they are an enrolled member of that tribe (which is important to the receipt of a number of benefits). The data allow analysts to distinguish those from California tribes, non-California tribes, and those whose affiliation or identification is not associated with any tribe.  The UCLA Center for Health Policy Research is in a unique position to analyze the data as it pertains to AIAN.  For the policy analysis, the Center for Health Policy Research can draw upon vast experience. As it has in the past for other populations (most recently the uninsured), the contractor has the ability to examine the results from the data analysis to identify the characteristics of individuals who have impaired access to care and determine which, if any, current state programs they may qualify for that they may not be using or, alternatively, gaps in program coverage that could be remedied through improving access to existing programs or timely legislation.  An important element to this project is supporting the opportunity for the study to be lead by Native American researchers. There is now a threshold number of AIAN public health researchers throughout the state and country, and this project will help to employ a research management strategy to capture the knowledge and abilities of these scientists.  To initiate this process, The Center for Health Policy Research has been able to establish a core analysis team of experts from academic and community settings.  This project is intended to create a model that can serve for other special/minority population research projects.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 20, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, a bureau of the Department of Commerce, intends to negotiate with only one responsible source, Applied Geographics, Incorporated, 355 Congress Street, Boston, Massachusetts, 02210, using simplified acquisition procedures, for the acquisition of geospatial data infrastructure layers for a Geographic Information System for the Boston metropolitan area.  The proposed contractor will build on work previously completed, which included identification of reliable data sources; establishment of a data sharing process; acquisition, review, evaluation, conversion, and transformation of data; quality control and assessment, integration of data into a framework and database; and development of metadata.  The proposed scope requires acquisition, review, selection, integration, and documentation of data sets in order to provide complete coverage of the pilot area for information in multiple data type categories: buildings, communication structures, environmental hazards, transportation, and utilities.  The proposed contractor is the only responsible source with specific experience in the current project.  Award to any other source would duplicate investment and result in unacceptable delay.  The Government intends to negotiate with only one responsible source pursuant to the authority of Part 6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Therefore, this notice is not a request for a submission.  However, interested parties may submit a description of their capabilities to perform within 15 days of this notice and the submission will be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this posting is to release two GAO protest decisions impacting this RFP. The decisions resolve protests numbered B-290751.1 (on the GAO electronic protest docket this is B-290751.001) and B-290751.2 (or B-290751.002).  The decisions are available here in association with this notice, and this serves as the official notice to offerors regarding these decisions. You will have to link through to posted documents to access the decisions (the system requires me to upload the files seperate from this message.)

Certain other protests have already been decided by GAO, and were not required to be sent out by the Contracting Officer to the interested party community.

I have been asked about the status of evaluations in a number of phone calls and e-mails. My general response is to say we are still evaluating. I will also say that we have begun tradeoff evaluations.  

As before, we are on the path to make awards without discussions, so no offer revisions will be accepted.

No response to this posting is required from offerors.

<DESC>RFI  N00024-03-R5103 Ammendment 001 12 Sept 2002 The Request For Information (RFI), associated with Open Systems Architecture (OSA) and issued on 26 August 2002, is hereby ammended as follows: Under the section entitled Responses 1. The first sentence of the 2nd paragraph is modified to read: NAVSEA is extending the time for submission of responses to COB September 27, 2002, early responses are encouraged. 2.   The fifth sentence of the 2nd paragraph is modified to read : NAVSEA will be considering various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or other non-procurement agreements (e.g. Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions). The entire Request For Information (RFI) as modified is provided below. Purpose The Naval Sea Systems Command (NSSC) is issuing a Request For Information (RFI) fro m all interested companies, traditional defense as well as non-traditional commercial entities, who have conceptual and/or technical understanding in the areas of software and electronics development.  The information is being collected under the auspices of Open Systems Architecture (OSA); a concept that will incorporate common engineering, information, protocol, computing and interface standards such as IEEE, ANSI, ISO, IETF, TCSE, POSIX, OMG, COBRA and other standards across various shipboard environments and platforms. In addition, an understanding of electronic, computing, and operating system characteristics such as real-time determinism and boundedness, responsiveness to asynchronous events, and mechanisms for synchronization and ordering in complex systems is required. This technical interchange will assist NSSC in establishing OSA requirements. OSAs missions include:  Anti Air Warfare (AAW), Ship Based Missile Defense (SBMD), Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW), Mine Warfare (MIW) Anti Surface Warfare (ASUW), Strike (STK), Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), Electronic Warfare (EW) and others.  Commercial contractors and vendors as well as defense contractors are strongly encouraged to respond to this notice.  Additional information or clarification is available upon request from Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: LCDR John H. Windom SEA02511W, 1333 Isaac Hall Avenue SE, M/S 2040, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-2040 at (202) 781-4965 or by e-mail at windomjh@navsea.navy.mil.  Due to the classification and/or sensitivity of the information interchange, no responses from foreign owned companies will be accepted. Company security clearances may be required for participation in future OSA related activities. Description Open Systems Architecture (OSA)  is a systems design approach [supported in theory and in principle by verifiable governmental testing platforms such as the Open Architecture Computing Environment (OACE)], that seeks to implement open specifications for interfaces, services and supporting formats. OSA will enable properly engineered components to be utilized across a wide range of systems with minimal change requirements necessary to interoperate with components on local and remote systems. In addition, the OSA concept will promote interaction between designers, suppliers and end users that facilitates portability. Through OSA, the Government will select common standards and products in the areas of frameworks, middleware, resource management and operating systems, utilizing established and evolving industry standards, and under the OSA premise, avoid proprietary solutions. The Government will ultimately deci de on the standards and specifications of products to be incorporated into its systems. This notice is intended to open channels of communication and promote interaction between industry, government and the cognizant technical authorities.  OSA Approach The objective of OSA submissions and subsequent meetings with industry is to define a technical and management approach to develop a non-platform specific, multi-mission, open system architecture using Government organized Integrated Product/Process Teams (IPTs), with a formal mechanism to obtain industry input for consideration by the IPTs. Responses Responses to this RFI should be limited to 10 pages or less and include supporting materials that lends for an effective evaluation of your companys technical competence and understanding of electronic, computing, and operating system characteristics such as real-time dete rminism and boundedness, responsiveness to asynchronous events, and mechanisms for synchronization and ordering in complex systems.  Discussions should also include how the aforementioned attributes can be developed within an OSA environment. In addition, submissions should include company history, major products, primary customer base, points of contacts (able to discuss the submitted materials), and a description of past experience.  NAVSEA is extending the time for submission of responses to COB September 27, 2002, early responses are encouraged. In early October 2002, the Government will invite those companies evaluated to have the requisite technical expertise to participate in a series of collaborative meetings on OSA during the subsequent 120-day period.  This process is designed to assist the Navy in defining its future across the entire fleet. The submitted informa tion and data packages will not be returned, and may form the basis for future Navy requirements. NAVSEA will be considering various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or other non-procurement agreements  (e.g. Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions). Small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  Companies responding to this request should provide one floppy or compact disk (Microsoft Word format) and two hard copies of their submission to: Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: LCDR John H. Windom SEA02511W, 1333 Isaac Hall Avenue SE, M/S 2040, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-2040 at (202 781-4965 or by e-mail at windomjh@navsea.navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center of Cancer Research, Neuro Oncology Branch (NOB), intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Spectral Genomics, Inc., 8080 NorthStadium Drive, Houston, TX 77054 100 Special Analysis - Single Kit Genomic Profiling (2-4Mb) Kits used to conduct large-scale gene expression analysis of thousands of human glioma tissues using microarray.  Genomic profiling is the technique of looking at copy changes across the entire chromosome and performing a linear plot across the chromosome in a Megabase resolution. This is very similar to "expression profiling" whereby one would line up genes from any particular region of the genome and look at the change of the number of copies at each position of each gene.  In the case of genomic analysis it is referred to as "genomic profiling".  Spectral Genomics arrays make use of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) which can be used in the cloning of large DNA fragments, on average approximately 200kb long, and has been used as one of the cloning vectors of choice in the sequencing of the human and mouse genomes.  Spectral Genomic employs a unique patented approach (Patent #6,048,596) to produce a series of BAC arrays that are ideal for array-based genome profiling.  These arrays allow the researcher the capacity to perform the sort of high-resolution genome scans required for the detection of chromosomal imbalances that are common events in most tumors and many congenital abnormalities.  Using Spectral Genomics, BAC arrays will permit the analysis of genomic profiling (CGH) of genes discovered by our microarray studies.  The reagent is essential for the NOB lab to better understand the molecular mechanisms of glioma, discovery of better diagnosis methods and prediction of clinical therapeutic outcomes, e.g., patient survival rate.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 18, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The NAICS Code:541380 and the business size standard is $6.0 million.  No collect calls for faxed copies of capability statements will be accepted.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to vendor questions received to date.  QUESTION:  Is this a small business set-aside?  ANSWER:  Yes 100%.  QUESTION:  Why are there a specified number of hours listed per each labor category (CLINS 0001 thru CLIN 0006). What do the hours represent?  ANSWER:  Not to exceed amounts.  QUESTION:  If the hours listed in CLINS 0001 thru CLIN 0006 are estimates, are they estimates per year or for the contract life? (Solicitation states -- "all for a one-year base period with four separately priced option years for the same hours applicable to each CLIN.") Please clarify.  ANSWER:  Per year.  QUESTION:  Do you expect a proposal to include prices for CLIN 0007 Other Direct Costs (ODCs)?  ANSWER:  The ceiling for CLIN 0007 is $100,000.00 as well as each subsequent option year.  QUESTION:  Will these prices/costs be proposed and negotiated when notice of an event is given after contract award?  ANSWER:  A request for proposal will be requested for each event and the fixed price per event will be awarded at that time.  QUESTION:  If pricing is required with the initial proposal, where is a description of a planned event in order for estimates to be provided?  ANSWER:  See previous response.  QUESTION:  Will the Government use an IMPAC card as a method of payment? If yes, please explain circumstances.  ANSWER:  No.  The contractor will be required to submit an invoice that is certified and forwarded to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for payment.  QUESTION:  Under minimum and maximum -- you list $10,000 as minimum contract amount. Is this the total amount the Government is obligated to spend?  ANSWER:  This is a minimum.  QUESTION:  Does this apply to the total contract life?  ANSWER:  Yes.  QUESTION:  Maximum states -- total negotiated amount for the respective base period and each option period. Please explain.  ANSWER:  The Maximum will be established as the total award amount for the base and each option period.  QUESTION:  Under "contractor responsibilities" -- it indicates the contractor shall, at this own expense, obtain all permits, etc. Is it the Government's intention for the contractor to have these items before contract award or rather the ability to obtain them prior to a scheduled event?  ANSWER:  The ability to obtain them prior to a scheduled event.

<SOLNBR>F19628-02-R-0072

<ARCHDATE>03312003
<CONTACT>Capt. Jeff Carbonetti, 781-377-2001; Dan Gorman, 781-377-3998
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis seeking potential prime contractors and is for Market Research purposes only.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. The Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Integration Systems Program Office, ESC, Hanscom AFB, MA, is seeking responsible contractors to develop, integrate, field, and test a spiral upgrade to AF DCGS (hereafter referred to as Block 10.2) to replace legacy IMagery INTelligence (IMINT) and Mission Management AF DCGS components of the U-2 Mission Intelligence Segment (MIS) and Deployable Transit Case (DTS) systems. The tasks under the Block 10.2 program are to define, implement, integrate, field and test a new IMINT, MASINT (Measurements and Signature INTelligence), ISR Management, and Mission Management capability to be integrated with the existing AF DCGS SIGnal INTelligence (SIGINT) capability. The Block 10.2 effort is the initial step toward the migration of AF DCGS to a fully integrated, multiple-INTelligence (multi-INT) capability that satisfies the Air Force DCGS Operational Requirement Document (ORD) and consists of the acquisition of a Multi-INT Core capability, a Surveillance and Warning component, and upgrade of existing and production of a new Data Relay system.  The DCGS Block 10.2 effort described in this sources sought will be the multi-INT Core capability that will include the following integrated functions: 1)	An integrated information management structure that includes a repository layer, process layer, and viewer/application layer.  All system components will affix metadata tags to all data with time stamps, reference to information sources, information processing pedigree, geographic reference, and target reference.  This will be linked through a collaborative environment that permits the dynamic access and manipulation of information at geographically separate areas. 2)	A multiple security level environment (not Multi-Level Security on the same enclave) with security enclaves separated by Protection Level-4 (PL-4) security guards to ingest, process, store, and disseminate multi-INT, multi-source data.  The levels involved include unclassified, collateral, SCI (Sensitive Compartmented Information), and allied/coalition force releasable data.  A key feature of the system will be the development of a bi-directional PL-4 certified High Speed Imagery Guard (HSIG) between the imagery processing and sensor control components at the Low level, and the NITF (National Imagery Transmission Format) storage system and Distributed Sensor Planner at the operating location System High level.  This High Speed Imagery Guard must be capable of handling three low side simultaneous feeds from CIP (Common Imagery Processor) and other sources at real time mission data rates and high-to-low feed of sensor tasking from the sensor planner back to the CIP. The system must be accreditable in accordance with Director of Central Intelligence Directive 6/3 (DCID ). 3)	A mission management capability that can distribute planning, tasking, and management services over the DCGS WAN and distributed relay SATCOM (SATellite COMmunication) network (referred hereafter as DCGS Processing, Exploitation, and  Dissemination Architecture -DPA) and over C4I networks (e.g. JWICS and SIPRNET).  Automated interfaces are required to national and tactical external tasking sources.  A Distributed Sensor Planner that can simultaneously plan and monitor multiple ISR collectors is integrated with these functions.  This capability will include interface to remote Air Force Forward (AFFOR) sites and their supported Air Operations Centers (AOC). 4)	A situational awareness and multi-INT environment that provides access to a collection of common data processing and fusion services.  The situational awareness function will combine various near real time reporting sources into a single integrated picture. This will include integrating the information from the S&W (Surveillance and Warning) component under separate development.  This function will be used to support mission management as well as the multi-INT reporting and fusion elements.  Layered Graphical Information System (GIS) products will be generated by a number of data repositories, some containing historical data and some containing real time information. 5)	An AF DCGS secure web based portal interface that provides a single point of integration for access to information, applications, and services for all customers of AF DCGS.  It provides the integration point for applications and information within the AF DCGS enterprise.  Publishing tools will automate the process by which information is made available to users.  From a security perspective, the Web Portal will exist behind a DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone) to provide user access, while still meeting the security requirements of DCID 6/3. 6)	An integration with a next generation Link Relay system that includes Common Data Link (CDL) aircraft data links, SATCOM, and CIP processing components including a CIP System Manager, Sensor Planner workstation, and a NITF product storage element.  This effort will also include interface to other ISR collector ground systems (e.g. Global Hawk Mission Control Element (MCE) and Predator Ground Control Station (GCS), line of sight radios, and  RFINT (Radio Frequency INTelligence) reachback equipment. 7)	The system must be able to operate in a standard office conditioned environment housed in either racks, operating transit cases, non-operating transport cases, or just on table tops.  The exact configurations will depend on specific user requirements.  The system will be capable of deployment by air, rail, ship or road.  The system must be able to operate from standard commercial or military generators. The number of contracts, acquisition strategies, contract types, and contractual relationships has not been defined at this point. Potential offerors will be required to have U.S citizen staff personnel with TS/SCI clearances and facility and storage capability in accordance with the NISPOM (DOD 5520.22-M) by contract award. Participation on this contract will be limited to US firms only. The Government requests potential prime contractors submit a capability package, not to exceed ten (10), 8.5 x 11 inch, one-sided pages (Format: Microsoft Word 97, Font Times Roman, 10 pt, 1.25 inch margins) via e-mail to dan.gorman@hanscom.af.mil and marie.sevigny@hanscom.af.mil not later than noon, 30 Sep 02.  The capability package should indicate the source's intent to participate in Block 10.2 multi-INT Core procurement as a prime contractor and should address understanding and/or experience in implementing the capabilities in functional areas 1-6 discussed above. The capability package should also include experience in applying and fielding systems compliant with the DOD Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), the Joint Airborne SIGINT Architecture (JASA), the National System for Geospatial Intelligence (NSGI), the Joint Airborne MASINT Architecture (JAMA), the DCGS Acquisition Standards Handbook - IMINT (DASH-I ) and related OSD DCGS standards and applicable NATO STANAGS  in the integration of multi-INT TPED capabilities.  Sources are also requested to identify any on-going Government contract vehicles they may have for the same or similar work (limit 1 page).  Please include the name and number of the on-going contracts, contract scope, contract type, period of performance, contract deliverables, dollar thresholds and limitations, the issuing Government agency, and the name and telephone number of the Contracting Officer. Potential prime contractors should identify their Program Manager (PM) and their internal contract Point Of Contacts (POCs) which will be posted on HERBB to promote potential opportunities for subcontracting and teaming. The Government intends to evaluate each prime contractor capability package submitted to determine whether they are considered "highly competitive" or "not highly competitive" and will notify each source, by e-mail, no later than10 Oct 02.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a request for bid or proposals, nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for information provided in response to this synopsis.   An Acquisition Ombudsman, Colonel Jerry T. Corley, Director, Commander's Staff, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development. You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired. The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection. You can contact the Ombudsman at (781) 377-5106. See Note 26.

SUBJECT:  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
POC:  William Pollard, 618-256-8692/Electronics Engineer
DESC:  This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis and market research.  Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government is currently conducting a market survey and analysis of commercially available products that can provide the Air Force and others in the Department of Defense with wireless local area network (WLAN) solutions to support global operating requirements.  WLAN products are needed to provide the Air Force communications and information community with effective alternatives to wired networks for in-garrison, temporary, deployed, and mobile applications.  The Air Force has not been able to take full advantage of WLAN products because they were not designed with emphasis on military use and do not address frequency spectrum available for military use. 

The Air Force seeks to identify commercially available frequency translation appliances to be used in conjunction with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) IEEE 802.11b devices.  The appliance should interface directly with IEEE 802.11b compliant devices (e.g., access points and PC cards), suppress the native carrier, and shift the operating frequency to one or more of the following ranges: (1.70 to 1.85GHz, 4.40 to 4.50GHz, 4.80 to 4.99GHz, 7.25 to 7.90GHz).  Performance (operating range and throughput) of IEEE 802.11b devices when operated with the frequency translation appliance should be similar to that when operated in it?s native frequency band.

 In your response to this RFI, please identify other vendor products that are interoperable with yours.  Businesses responding to the market research are requested to provide information regarding what they have available meeting the above requirements within 30 days after the posting date of this notice.  Potential vendors may express interest, make comments and ask questions via electronic mail or fax comments or questions to the Air Force Communications Agency, Technology Analysis Branch, at AFCA-TCIA@scott.af.mil, FAX (618) 256-8944.  All comments and questions must be in writing and must identify the company source, contact person, and telephone number.

The Government will accept a similar system with identified products from another vendor, however, the products must be equivalent in form and function.  This equipment is needed to provide automated size exclusion chromatography for cleanup of environmental samples.  This equipment will complement the existing analytical capacity of the chemical Contaminants Research Group of the Ecotoxicology Branch of the Hollings Marine Laboratory.  This equipment has been selected on the basis of compatibility with anticipated systems, work flows and databases and specific technical innovations which no other vendor has at this point in time.  The minimum requirements for this instrument include the ability to perform automated, unattended gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on samples for environmental analysis.  This application requires multiple injection modes, including Loop Overfill, Direct Inject and Partial Loop Fill.  It must operate with safety features like power fail management and solvent reservoir monitoring in order to avoid sample loss.  Samples must be able to run from septa sealed vials.  The data system must allow storage and retrieval of detector plots for each run, flexible programming, calculation and display of resolution results according to EPA CLP requirements and report exporting in multiple formats.  The features of this GPC equipment that make it unique are its direct inject capability, 70 or more sample capacity, software control by computer touchscreen and personal digital accessory (PDA), solvent bottle level sensor that protects the GPC column from going dry, and integrated power management features which reduce the probability of sample loss.  The system consists of an auto inject module, an auto sampler module, high-pressure pump system, syringe pump with syringe, UV detector and controller software.  The sample is direct injected onto a GPC column and fractions are either diverted to waste or into a fraction collection tube.  Safety features include solvent level monitoring.  The chromatography software allows for annotation of chromatograms and automatic quality control checks with standard samples.  The following specifications apply: (1) Built in Touch Screen Controller - Requires no Personal Computer for operation.  (2) Includes PDA for Instrument Control and Data Acquisition. (3) Includes PC for Chromatography Data Package. (4)  5 Column Selector - Utilize multiple columns in a sequence with programmable flow-rate and equilibration times.  (5) Septum Piercing capability. (6) Probe Tracking for sample pickup. (7) Direct Injection Modes: (a) Partial Loop Filling. (b) Loop Overfill. (c) Sample Bracketing Control. (D) Programmable Multiple Injections.

<SUBJECT>Linkless Ammunition
<DESC>Potential sources are being sought for an improved system to convey cartridges to United States Army light and medium machinegun feed mechanisms. The current method of using metal links to convey cartridges results in a significant amount of weight in combat loads due to the weight of the links and adds link production quality issues to production of the ammunition. Either a linkless system or an improved method to supply cartridges to light and  medium machinegun feed mechanisms is required to address these issues. Desired characteristics of the linkless system or improved system include reduced  weight, improved reliability, lower cost and ease of manufacture. Little or no change to gun mechanisms is desired but not required. The system may be in development or production.

The diesel fuel oil price will be Baltimore Harbor price, as posted in Journal of Commerce, plus transportation costs, and any applicable taxes on day of delivery.  There are no minimum nor maximum volume obligations on the part of AFRH-W.  The only obligation is to purchase 100% of its interruptible natural gas and/or fuel oil requirements from the contractor.  Prior to the beginning of each month the contractor will provide an analysis of the expected cost of burning natural gas verses burning fuel oil.  AFRH-W will have the option, at that time, to choose natural gas or fuel oil for  the following month fuel source.  Analysis will be faxed to 202-730-3593 NLT: 25th of each month for the following month.   The COR AFRH-W will then make a selection, and will sign and fax back the selection to the contractor at             .  This will be accomplished not later than noon, east coast time, on the last business day of the month prior to the effective date of the selection.  Historical data will be supplied to the contractor for the purpose of nominating therms of natural gas to be distributed through the distribution company.

AFRH-W will provide a 24 hour notice to the contractor in the event of significant planned usage changes.  In the event that natural gas market prices are higher than locked-in prices, AFRH-W will have the option of burning alternate fuel so that the contractor can sell the nominated monthly therm allotment at the higher price and share the profit from the proceeds at a rate of 75% to AFRH-W and 25% to the contractor.  Any share to AFRH-W will be applied to the next billing cycle reducing the liability by the 75% share.  The contractor will be responsible for monitoring prices and providing AFRH-W with a 24 hour notice of market changes.
Acting as the agent for AFRH-W, the contractor will be responsible for paying the distribution company by the due date for any and all distribution charges associated with therms used while the contract is in effect. Upon validation of all charges, AFRH-W will reimburse the contractor for distribution charges paid as a result of acting as the AFRH-W agent.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; written quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number 02Q153 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-09. This action is a 100% small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 334413 and the small business size standard is 500.  This is a short suspense requirement.  The U.S. Secret Service has a requirement For a Argon Ion Laser System with Heat Exchanger with the following specifications: LASER SYSTEM  Power output  25W *M2 <_ 1.1 Long term power stability: <_0.5% in light regulation mode (measured over 8 hours) <_1.0% in current regulation mode Optical noise: 0.2% RMS in light regulation mode 0.2% RMS in current regulation mode Beam Diameter: 1.9 mm @ 1/e2  points Beam Divergence:<_ 0.4 mrad (full angle) Beam Pointing Stability:<5 urad/oC angle change <5 um/oC beam offset change - Input power requirements cannot exceed 70 Amps, 480 VAC(3 phase).  System must be capable of operating with a +/_10% fluctuation in input voltage.  Cooling water for the laser head and power supply are to be provided from a closed loop heat exchanger.  Performance specifications for the heat exchanger are listed below. Plasma tube is to be of metal disk bore/ceramic envelope construction providing drop-out free operation and uniform gas distribution within the plasma tube.  The ceramic is to consist of one piece and contain no frits, welds, or brazes.  Plasma tube shall have the output coupler sealed directly to the plasma tube to eliminate absorption of plasma UV in the anode window, which results in premature tube failure.  System is to be supplied with RS-232C interface to allow its use with laboratory computers.  Laser is to be supplied with a remote control module located on the end of a _15 foot cable.  Included in this remote control module is to be a simultaneous digital display of output power, operating mode (light or current regulation), operating wavelength, transverse mode status, and plasma discharge current level.  The remote control module shall also provide latching fault diagnostic displays and all controls necessary to operate and monitor the laser and heat exchanger.  Remote control module is to contain provision to allow the user to immediately (<1 sec), repeatably, and reproducibly switch back and forth between 1 watt multiline output and 25 watt multiline output in both light and current regulation modes.  Using RS-232 interface, system shall be capable of switching between 10 different power settings.  Laser shall be able to automatically align itself to a lasing condition from a non-lasing condition with no requirement for the user to open the laser head cover or align cavity mirrors.  Laser shall be able to automatically tune to individual laser wavelengths as directed by the operator.  When wavelengths are changed, the laser shall automatically recalibrate the power detection photocell to the new wavelength to optimize operation.  Laser shall be able to automatically realign both cavity mirrors to optimize cavity alignment and achieve maximum output powers.  Laser shall have a detector that monitors mode-beat noise and is capable of determining when TEMoo (M2 _ 1.1) operation of the laser has been achieved.  Laser shall be provided with an intracavity aperture to allow control of the transverse mode of the laser.  This aperture shall be motor-driven and controlled from the remote control module.  Operator shall be able to select individual aperture sizes, select TEMoo operation, or select the closed position.  If TEMoo operation is selected, laser is to automatically set the aperture to the size that acquires TEMoo at the highest possible output power.  If the closed position is selected, the intracavity beam shall be interrupted and lasing prevented.  Laser shall have an integral shutter that is located outside of the laser cavity and is capable of blocking the output beam without interrupting lasing.  This shutter is to be controlled from the remote control module to allow its opening and closing.  This shutter shall have the capability of being used with a safety interlock system such that when the door to the laboratory is opened, the shutter will close and block the laser beam.  Includes a 15 foot armored fiber delivery package including 'pistol-style' handpiece with integrated laser on/off switch and LED indicator lights.  Must include a high efficiency diffractive optic diffuser to eliminate laser speckle. Transmission efficiency >70% measured after collimating lenses and diffuser.  This laser shall provide self-timed exposures without the need for any external control device.  User shall be able to set exposure times on the remote control module from 0.1 second to 3250 seconds in 0.1 second increments.  To allow integration into the experimental configuration, laser head width cannot exceed 8.00".  The plasma tube Brewster window must be of hard sealed crystalline quartz to prevent color center formation due to plasma UV degradation which results in premature failure of the plasma tube.  Laser system is to utilize an automatic gas pressure monitoring and filling system to maintain optimum plasma tube pressure.  HEAT EXCHANGER  Heat exchanger is to be capable of transferring 60 kW of heat from the laser system secondary cooling water loop to the primary water supply.  Heat exchanger must regulate the secondary cooling water temperature to ?1?C.  Heat exchanger is to be interfaced with the laser system for power and control.  Heat exchanger will automatically be turned on when laser is turned on, and shall continue circulating water in the secondary cooling loop for a period of 5 minutes after laser system is turned off, at which time the heat exchanger will turn itself off.  Heat exchanger must display the temperature, water flow rate, and resistivity of the secondary cooling water loop on the laser remote control module to allow the operator to monitor critical cooling water parameters.  Heat exchanger must shut down the laser in the event that water flow drops below allowable levels, cooling water temperature rises above allowable levels, or resistivity of secondary cooling water drops below allowable levels.
