Prior to release of any controlled documents under this solicitation, any U.S. contractor must acknowledge its responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations (including the obligation, under certain circumstances, to obtain an export license prior to the release of technical data within or outside the United States) and agree that it will not disseminate any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations. Upon review of your written request, verification of your status and acknowledgement of the contractor's responsibility under the US Export laws and regulations, the requested documents will be provided.</p>

Synopsis: 
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, is seeking architecture or architecture/engineering firm (NAICS 541310) capable of the planning and design of newly constructed and renovated hospitals, large outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, health care and biomedical research, and similarly complex healthcare projects.  The  architecture or architecture/engineering firm must be capable of preparing all design and construction documentation including, but not limited to, advance/master planning, site development, utility infrastructure design, local utility approval, architecture, medical planning, civil engineering, structural engineering including seismic design, mechanical engineering, historic preservation, environmental protection, communication and data engineering, electrical engineering, interior design, landscape design, commissioning, construction cost estimating and market research, parking and traffic studies, geotechnical investigation and surveying, seismic design for new and existing buildings.  The prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines as members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architects, Medical Planners, Structural Engineers, Seismic Design Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Geo-technical Engineers, Historic Preservation Architects, Environmental Engineers, Communications and Electrical Engineers, Interior Designers, Sustainable Design and LEED Accredited Professionals, and Cost Estimators. All members should have experience in the planning and design of new hospitals (incorporating the Planetree Patient-Centered Care model), large medical and significant outpatient/ambulatory care clinics, medical research facilities, or similar complex healthcare projects.

Scope:
This project will correct potentially hazardous seismic, life safety and infrastructure deficiencies, as well as consolidate outpatient programs and clinical research into a state of the art treatment facility located at the VA Sierra Nevada Health Care System's Reno campus. The proposed project will accomplish renovation of approximately 90% of Building 1, with the exclusion of the major utility and life safety improvements which were completed within the last 3 years. The proposed project would provide the following upgrades in Building 1 which is approximately 138,007 square feet.

1. Seismic upgrades to reduce/eliminate the possibility of catastrophic failure of the 60+ year old building should a significant seismic event occur.

2. Correct life safety and infrastructure deficiencies.

3. Substantially improve building energy efficiencies.

In addition, this project will construct up to approximately 100,000 square feet of clinical expansion to correct space deficiencies.  The Research Program would also be increased as part of this project.  The following programs will be impacted and will benefit from the proposed project: Mental Health, Dental, Compensation and Pension, Audiology, Patient Admissions and Testing, Surgical Service, Quality Management, Veterans Service Offices, Warehouse, Voluntary Services, Veterans Eligibility Center, Geriatrics and Extended Care, Dietetics, In-patient Kitchen, Morgue, Laboratory and Pathology Services, Research, Surgical Service, Medical Service, Ambulatory Care (Patient Centered Medical Home), OEF/OIF, and Women's Health Clinic. The expansion has been tentatively located at the east side of Building 12. The exact location will be determined after all access and adjacencies have been analyzed by an Architect to determine the ideal location.

Seismic design will adhere to VA's manual for Seismic Design Requirements (H-18-8).  Space layout and interior partitioning will meet current VA Space Planning Guidelines and optimize patient care and staff efficiency.  Applicants must demonstrate success in sustainable design including prescribing the use of recovered materials, achieving waste reduction, water reduction,  energy efficiency and low energy building  design; additionally, the project will comply with the VA Sustainable Design and Energy Reduction Manuals.  The project will be required to attain a minimum LEED Silver certification.  Renewable and innovative energy systems will be required as part of this project.  Mechanical, plumbing, electrical, nurse call, medical gases, and fire and safety systems, etc. will meet current codes and standards.  All structures and utilities will be designed to meet VA's criteria as detailed in its Physical Security Design Manual for VA Facilities, both Life-Safety Protected and Mission Critical Facilities.  The design will be required to comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and PG-18-13 in all areas.  Required services will include preparation of equipment schedules, schematics design, design development, and construction documents (both plans and specifications), medical and research equipment planning, site design, and including all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines as well as estimates of construction costs and market surveys with each design submittal.

The estimated price range for this construction project is over $100,000,000.  At this time it is anticipated that the renovation will include approximately 90% of Building 1and construction of a clinical addition which may follow the design-bid-build delivery method.  Once a thorough analysis of the user's and the facility's needs has been completed, the scope and method of meeting those needs may change and require a different design delivery method, to include integrated design and construction.  The base contract for Pre-design, Schematic and Design Development documents will include options for construction documents, construction period services, additional site visits, and other professional services.

Only firms, or teams, with in-house architectural services, recent experience in the design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities similar to that proposed will be considered.  Additional tasks may include site analysis and campus master plan.  Emphasis will be placed on previous successful experience with construction and renovations of medical facilities, along with the requisite Quality Assurance/Quality Control procedures, additionally cost and scope management capabilities will be examined.  In addition, the firms or teams must demonstrate their ability to effectively utilize IFC version 2x-3 (or later) compliant parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) system in developing this project from its initial conception through completion of documentation per the VA BIM Guide.  The team shall have the experience, ability, and data management skills to execute an integrated design approach using BIM technology.  Only architects or architect/engineer firms, or teams, demonstrating the above capabilities and a planned approach to perform contract services will be considered.

In addition to design capabilities, estimating capabilities of the applicants will be considered.  A market study to include Project Labor Agreements (PLA) and an estimate of construction cost based on level of design detail will be required at each design phase.  The phases include Schematic Design 1, Schematic Design 2, Design Development 1, Design Development 2, and Construction Documents.  The selected team shall design to the government's estimated cost for construction at time of award.  More design submission requirements can be found in VA Guide PG-18-15.

<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101, the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: Michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
