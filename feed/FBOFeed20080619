<RESPDATE>080608
<CONTACT>Rick L Murrow, Construction Contract Specialist, Phone 580-213-6054, Email rick.murrow.ctr@vance.af.mil - 
<DESC><p>CSC Applied Technologies LLC (CSC) is contemplating the issue of solicitation IFB115B for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Maintain Airfield Pavements Paint and Rubber Removal. Should an IDIQ contract result, any resulting work will be purchased by issue of a Delivery Order against the IDIQ contract. The contemplated solicitation would include work at Vance AFB to include painting of markings on three runways, taxiways, aircraft parking areas and Base street striping, and is expected to include rubber removal on three runways. Work is expected to also involve painting one non-precision runway markings at Kegelman Auxiliary Air Field. The IDIQ will have an effective period of three years (Bids for work in the IDIQ will be valid for up to 36 months from a resulting award of IDIQ) and will include a yearly predetermined economic price adjustment percentage that will be part of the initial offer. Offerors should consider the impact to their bonding capacity when considering bidding on this IDIQ. Estimated maximum dollar amount of the entire IDIQ if completely funded is expected to be less than $500K. Minimum delivery is expected to be one delivery order the first contract year for less than $150K. Should funds for the minimum delivery in contract year one be provided, no minimum delivery will apply to IDIQ contract years two or three and additional delivery orders may or may not result. Funds are not currently available for the contemplated IDIQ and have not been promised or guaranteed. There shall be no legal liability on the part of the Government or CSC should funding not be provided. In the absence of funding for a minimum delivery order in the first contract year no IDIQ contract will result. <br />The work consists of furnishing all labor, equipment, quality control reports, materials and all other necessary supplies, fuels, lubricants, fluids, solvents, parts, tools, required to perform all operations in connection with removal of rubber and paint from airfield pavement surfaces and repainting markings. Also included is the surface preparation and layout of new and existing markings and application of traffic paints and reflective media to airfield and base street pavements in accordance with the specification and project drawings. Vance AFB is an AETC training Base which has T-6, T-1 and T-38 aircraft in use on the facility. These lighter aircraft do not typically create a great amount of built up rubber to be removed and the majority of removal is on one end of two runways due to more aircraft recoveries occurring on these ends because of local predominate winds. The contractor will be allowed to work rubber removal on one runway at a time and generally after flying hours have ended. This is due to the need for all runways while flying is occurring.
<p>Contractor certification of equipment paint and rubber removal rates using a vehicle mounted non-chemical water blast method capable of removing 95% of rubber deposits at a rate of 10,000SF/Hr and 95% of existing paint at a rate of 1,000SF/Hr will be required. A satisfactory past performance history of work accomplished on an active military airfield or commercial airfield is required. Cost and Past Performance will be considered as equal in determining the best value.</p>

<DESC><p>
<p>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Santa Barbara Infrared, Inc (SBIR), 30 South Calle Cesar Chavez, Suite D, Santa Barbara, CL 93103. AFRL/RWG desires to develop a 1024 x 1024 cryogenic emitting array device with operational performance down to 50K operating temperatures for providing interactive infrared images to seekers in hardware-in-the-loop facilities. The emitter array will have the following additional characteristics; radiometric apparent temperature maximum of 650 K (MWIR) and 500 K (LWIR), temporal response from 10% to 90% of full radiometric output in 5 milliseconds (MWIR at 80K operating temperature) and 90% to 10% of full radiometric output in 4 milliseconds (LWIR at 80K operating temperature), droop of less than 1% radiometric output over 20 milliseconds, spec-compliant at operational temperatures between 50 K to 80 K and non-spec compliant operation at 300 K, and raster (goal) and snap-shot frame update modes. SBIR will develop the cryogenic emitting array device by scaling-up the proven Optimized Array for Space-Background Infrared Simulation (OASIS) 512 x 512 design. SBIR is uniquely qualified for this effort since they own the exclusive license from Honeywell for their emitter technology. The implementation of this technology required SBIR to conduct an exhaustive search of domestic and foreign micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) foundries for the ideal emitter foundry. The search was followed by validation runs at Honeywell, transfer of emitter technology process, and finally validation runs at the new foundry. However, all interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC), which will be considered if received within 15 days of publication of this notice. Submit to: Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RWK), Attn: Carolyn Hudson, 101 W. Eglin Blvd. Ste. 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542. Please refer technical questions to Ronald J. Rapp, 850-883-1926 and business questions to Carolyn Hudson, 850-883-2669. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offeror or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and all recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the contracting points of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is Sue Hunter at 937-904-9700.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement. The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the Verigy V93000 to replace an obsolete HP83000.  The system consists of a test head assembly which comprises all the electronics to evaluate the DUT.  It also consists of a main computer console which supports the operation of the test head and a network of four workstations used for creating test programs offline.  In addition, there is a test head manipulator to support the test head, a chiller for cooling the test head electronics.  System software consists of a Unix operating system with a suite of HP developed software to control the tester electronics.  This test system is configured for 80 pin electronics which can operate up to a frequency of 330 MHz, and four programmable power supplies.  The sole source procedures are being used because Verigy has unique software that will convert TE’s existing HP83000 test programs to the V93000 test system.  Verigy’s testing software is proprietary.   All of the 617 test projects developed in the past twelve years on the HP83000 will be lost if the V93000 is not procured. A sole source award will result in approximately $1 Mil additional savings to the Government in costs to redevelop the programs.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In accordance with FAR 5.207, all responsible sources may submit information which shall be considered by the agency.  However, THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The.  Point of contact:  Deborah Collins, 614-692-1783 or e-mail:  deborah.collins@dla.mil  The NAICS code is 334515.  The anticipated award date of the contract is 08/04/2008.

                                                               Hypothetical Task Order No.1

Corridor Transportation Plan

It is approximately 30 miles from Chicago Union Station to Joliet, IL via the Illinois Central Railroad route through Lockport.  Amtrak currently operates 3 round trips per day over this route, but anticipates increasing service to 10 round trips in the future.  Metro currently operates 3 round trips per day, but anticipates increasing service to 15 round trips.  Freight service varies from 6-10 round trips over various portions of the route including locals.  Within this distance are 6 diamond crossings, 5 of which have more than 50 moves per day across the corridor.  It is desired to reduce the current trip time from 50 minutes (including a stop at Summit) to 40 minutes with service densities increased to the proposed levels.  Please outline the process that you would consider necessary to undertake in order to prepare a concept level track configuration and construction staging plans along with appropriate construction cost estimates.

The estimated period of performance is 9 months.  Your proposal shall specifically address the following:  

1.  Organizational management and staffing requirements and assignments for the prime contractor and any subcontractors.

2.  Field site visits and investigations to define existing conditions.

3.  Simulation of train movements/performance.

4.  Bridges.

5.  Track work.

6.  Signals and communications.

7.  Passenger station impacts/modifications.

8.  Minimize operational impacts of freight and commuter service.

9.  Interactions with the owning rail carrier(s) for operations analysis and field surveys.

                                                             Hypothetical Task Order No. 2

Corridor Environmental/Historic Documentation

Local officials have identified a 350 mile rail line between two major cities as a prime candidate for high speed rail passenger service.  Approximately 200 miles of line near one city used to be double track, but the remainder has always been single track without signals and has few short passing tracks.  There is several wildlife preserves scattered along the route and a tribe of American Indians claim to have a burial ground near MP 287.  Three former passenger stations and an adjacent freight house have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as an iron bridge at MP 286.  A former telephone pole creosoting plant near one city is proposed as the site of a passenger car yard with an adjacent electro-plating shop to be used for locomotive repairs.  Plans call for reinstalling the second main track, adding new main line crossovers at 12 sites, replacing wood ties with concrete ties, installing 300 miles of welded rail and a new signal system.  The single track segment will get a new signal system, 6 new 5 mile long passing tracks centered on MP 221, 245, 265, 285, 310 and 330.  The iron bridge at MP 286 is damaged and must be replaced.  The local agencies expect to operate 15 round trips per day over this route at speeds up to 150 mph.

It is expected to take 15 months to complete the various environmental/historic documents.  Outline how your company would handle this task, what documents need to be prepared, what organizations need to be consulted or approvals obtained, the need for public consultations, etc., discuss the use of environmental impact statements, categorization exclusions, and findings of no significant impacts in this situation.


                                                              Hypothetical Task Order No. 3

Grade Crossing Protection Evaluation Course

The FRA has a requirement to prepare a course on techniques to assess and evaluate highway grade crossing protection on designated high-speed corridors around the United States.  The course is to be given to various State and local officials.  In addition to assessing and evaluating existing protection systems associated with various levels of highway and train traffic, the course needs to address techniques for improving highway grade crossing protection using approaches similar to those undertaken by the State of North Carolina (Sealed Corridor Program).  Likewise, the system developed by the State of New York, which assesses risks associated with alignment, traffic volume and vehicle mix, train volume and type of train (passenger, commuter, and freight), road surface, etc., shall be included in the course.

Development of the course is expected to take 6 months.  Describe how you would go about preparing the course, what would be included, who would be tasked to do the work, what the finished product would look like and how you would go about giving the course in 27 States to an average audience of 25 people.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a high precision laser beam expander (off axisconfiguration, Dall-Kirkham design) for the "DAWN AIR1", an airborne 2-microncoherent-detection Doppler wind lidar system.NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the item from Nu-Tek Precision Optical Corp (Aberdeen, MD)as the only reasonably available source.  Nu-Tek was recently competitively awarded acontract to design and build a similar beam expander for use in the laboratory.  In lidarapplication, especially for coherent Doppler detection, the beam-expander is a criticalsubsystem in transmitting and receiving the laser pulse and its return signal withminimal wavefront distortion.  The lidar receiving system is carefully and laboriouslyfine tuned to the beam expander; and the measurements must be calibrated and validatedwith known referent measurements.  The procurement being sought is to design and build abeam expander that will be engineered to meet the flight requirements for use in NASAsDC-8 Airborne Science Laboratory.  For the measurements to be meaningful, we will have tocompare and validate flight measurement with known ground measurement to properlyquantify and validate system performance.  The flight unit therefore must have the exactoptical design and performance as in the laboratory version being used for development. Otherwise, there will be much needed re-engineering effort for the lidar processingsystem.  This would result in significant cost increase to the Government and wouldsignificantly increase risk to the flight program.  NuTek is building the laboratoryversion, and has the relevant knowledge and experience that will be readily applicable tothe custom aircraft flight unit.  This knowledge and experience is not readilytransferable to another contractor.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon 26 June 2008.

<DESC>The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) intends to develop an internet based program that mine product manufacturers can use to submit application to MSHA for approval of their product.  The MSHA Office of Technical Support would deploy this program as a means to offset the significant personnel resources that are currently required to assist manufacturers in making application to MSHA for approval of their product  
1.	SCOPE 
The contractor will develop the necessary software at their facility that can interact with various sources of information on the MSHA website to enable the end user to search the MSHA website for applicable documentation and to submit the necessary information to the A&CC to start the approval investigation process.  Communications must be maintained with A&CC approval personnel as well as personnel from the Office of Program Evaluation and Information Resources (PEIR).

Option:  This contract will also have an option for one or two additional events.  The requirements for the events will be similar to the events in the statement of work.

Managing the logistics of a fundraising campaign for the entire NIH involves intricate logistics and knowledge of the art of charitable fundraising, alongside an adept understanding of NIH process, personal and working environment. The Recreation and Welfare Association is the only known source able to provide the required expertise and understanding of the required CFC activities in the NIH environment and culture.  The Recreation and Welfare Association Incorporated is uniquely qualified for this contract and has a long history of conducting these activities for NIH.  With out this knowledge a delay in completing all requirements for the campaign and the success of the program could be jeopardy.  Recreation and Welfare Association Incorporated has performed this task for other institutes at the NIH and is uniquely qualified to perform this service for NCI. Recreation and Welfare Association Inc. has previous experience coordinating the complexities of the requirements of the NIH CFC such as overall agenda, security, transportation, parking, supplies, safety, charities, entertainment, as well as staff and volunteer coordination for the events. It is necessary that the vendor be able to meet and supply all of the above requirements not any one individual requirement. The Recreation and Welfare Association Inc. has a unique relationship with the NIH in that they are already situated to establish liaisons with property management, security, and other personnel.  Furthermore, this organization is the employees’ organization in the sense that it organizes events and activities in other areas for employees, and the organization is easily recognized by all employees at NIH – this enables events to be planned quickly and receive outstanding attendance as required for the CFC campaign.

<RESPDATE>070308
<CONTACT>Melissa P Marino, Phone 301-402-4509, Fax 301-402-4513, Email marinome@mail.nih.gov - Caren N Rasmussen, Lead Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email cr214i@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis for an upgrade to 32 channel PMT Array Detector for LSM 710 Confocal System with Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood NY 10594.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR 13.106-(b)(1)  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The CCR Confocal Microscopy Core Facility was established by the NCI Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis in September 1997.  The core facility provides state-of-the-art confocal microscopy and digital imaging to CCR investigators to perform high quality clinical and translational research in cancer biology and to train students, residents, and fellows in the field of confocal microscopy.  The core facility also provides services and opportunities for collaborative research to investigators throughout the NCI as well as other NIH Institutes and FDA.</p>
<p>The CCR Confocal Core Facility in the Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis purchased the new Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope system that was just released commercially in February 2008.  At that time the availability of an upgrade to the 32ch PMT array was not known.  This upgrade is a significant technological improvement to the PMT and will enable users of the new system to separate closely emitting fluorophores that cannot be separated using the conventional PMTs.   As a core facility, we need to provide over 135 users with "state-of-the-art" confocal imaging for a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>PART II. Facts and Reasons To Justify Other than Full And Open Competition</p>
<p>1.	Statute: 13.106-1 (b)(1)</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).</p>
<p><br />2.	Sole Source Justification</p>
<p>The NCI previously purchased the Zeiss LSM 710 confocal system.  The newly developed Zeiss 32ch PMT array is only available from Carl Zeiss MicroImaging and is an upgrade PMT to the current confocal system.</p>
<p>The upgrade to the Zeiss 32ch PMT Array for the pre-existing Zeiss LSM 710 confocal system was designed by the firm Carl Zeiss, Inc. and is only available from them.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on July 3, 2008.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.

The anticipated contract will provide for research and development support and other scientific and engineering effort funded by all appropriation types.  The task order contract will have a base ordering period of five (5) years and an associated estimated contract ceiling Not-to-Exceed $9,950,000.  The GTRI task order contract is anticipated to provide 5 years of uninterrupted essential research and development support and specialized engineering efforts. The Navy has a requirement to maintain certain core capabilities at GTRI that it deems essential, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3)(B), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3(b)(2).  This acquisition will enable the Navy to access established and essential engineering, research and development capabilities at GTRI in the following areas: (1) basic and applied research, exploratory, and advanced development of Radio Frequency (RF), Millimeter- Wave (MMW), infrared,  and Electro-Optical (EO) missile sensors, ultraviolet and acoustical airborne and ground sensors, guidance and control systems (including simulation and modeling for design and performance predications of the complete missile weapon system); (2) Advanced electronics design and packaging for very compact, high performance signal processing, automatic target recognition, and guidance and control subsystems.; (3) next-generation photonics components and subsystem for radar control; (4) computer and physical modeling and analysis of threat systems/subsystems based on sensor spectrum, missile-target geometry, and natural as well as man-made environmental features; (5) system accessibility, susceptibility, and vulnerability analysis, modeling and counter-countermeasure development; (6) independent evaluation, modeling, and testing of ballistic missile defense phased-array radar systems at the system, subsystem, and component levels; (7) analysis, modeling, and development of adaptive digital beamforming techniques and technologies for missile defense applications; and (8) prototype and proof-of-principle hardware design and development, including component, test fixtures and advanced technology subsystems and systems for missile defense systems.  This solicitation is contemplated as a sole source procurement with GTRI; as this educational institution is a Federally-recognized University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) and has maintained a robust strategic relationship with the US Army and other Department of Defense (DoD) and non-DoD agencies since 1971.  The purpose of this announcement is to provide information and to promote subcontracting opportunities, if a contract should result from this procurement action.  Only US COMPANIES (NOFORN) will be entertained for subcontracting opportunities and potential subcontractors must possess a TOP SECRET facility clearance at the time of award.  Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact GTRI directly.

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a firm-fixed price contract for a GSM Base Station Dual Band EGSM900-DCS1800, HII Macro BTS Ancillary equipment, BSC software and installation/ integration support.   This effort will be issued using other than full and open competition to Motorola, Incorporated, 7031 Columbia Gateway Drive, Columbia MD 21046 in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Delivery will be FOB Destination, NSWC Crane IN 47522-5000.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Motorola, Incorporated.

Interested parties may respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The POC is Ms. Julie D.

The United States for International Development (USAID) plans to support a new program that seeks to strengthen the Justice Sector Development in Afghanistan.

JSD will also work closely with law and Sharia faculties to reform, modernize and increase their capacity to produce the next generation of legal professionals capable of sustaining reform efforts.  Working with the Supreme Court, Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and others, justice sector institutional capacity will be increased and access to justice will be enhanced for the citizens of Afghanistan.

USAID/Afghanistan encourages qualified offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  We anticipate issuing RFP 306-08-024 o/a June 21, 2008.  Proposals due date will be approximately August 7, 2008.

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT NOTICE OF INTENT TO LEASE SPACE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION DORAL, FLORIDA 


The United States Government intends to award a lease extension, using other than full and open competition to CV Miami LLC, Miami Free Zone. 
The extension will be for 10,006 usable/rentable square feet of warehouse space for a term of one month.

The Government has a continuing need for this space until such time as a new lease can be awarded.  It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the Government’s intent
to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Andrea Cooney, Realty Specialist, at andrea.cooney@gsa.gov or to her attention at:  GSA, Property Acquisition 
& Realty Services Division (4PEC),  Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351.  Any written comments are to be received within five (5) days of publication of this notice.


Responses are due by close of business June 25, 2008.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.     (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

This announcement is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP) or Invitation for Bids (IFB) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future, nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. No solicitation is available at this time. GSA's Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) is acting on behalf of its' client, Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), to provide an Enterprise IDIQ contractual vehicle for Whole Facility Maintenance including supermarket refrigeration/HVAC operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of DeCA's worldwide commissaries, both CONUS and OCONUS. There are a total of 265 commissaries with 5 distribution centers worldwide under the direction of DeCA.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 561210, Facility Support Services, with the NAICS Code size standard at $32.5 Million.</p>

GSA Contracting Officers worldwide utilize CCR to identify possible sources and Financial Officers use the system to make payments. To register in CCR, vendors may use one of the following methods: (a) Call telephone number 1-888-CCR-2423 for further information; or (b) Input information directly into the CCR database through the web application at http://www.ccr.gov/.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division is seeking qualified sources to provide an Unattended Ground Sensor (UGS) capability required to support persistent operations within an asymmetric environment.  The sensors are required to detect/track both vehicle and foot traffic within an area of employment.  Sensors should be easy to emplace/operate and capable of long periods of unattended operation.  A baseline sensor suite will consist of six acoustic and six seismic sensors, a total of twelve sensors/suite.  Sensors may be separately packaged or combined into sensor clusters, seismic plus acoustic in a single case. Mature sensors and system architectures (Technology Readiness Level 8 or higher) are desired.   The Government estimates purchasing in excess of one hundred sensor suites to meet anticipated fielding requirements.  Individual sensors will not be manned.  Sensor alerts will be transmitted back to a   monitoring station located up to 5 kilometers from the individual sensor.  For situational awareness purposes, the emphasis is on minimizing the time from alarm at the sensor to alarm reception at the monitoring station.  Operational considerations make cabling between sensors and the monitoring station impractical for this application.  As a minimum, sensors should incorporate a wireless path for data transmission between individual sensors and the central monitoring location.  Assume a desert terrain.  Repeaters are allowable.  A base sensor system shall consist of six acoustic and six seismic sensors, for a total of twelve sensors/suite.  The system includes sensors and their packaging, any external power systems, any communications hardware required to transmit alerts back to a monitoring site and any devices required to program the sensors.  Sensors will typically operate unattended over long operational periods.  Sensor requirements are detailed in the following paragraphs. Detection Requirements.  Sensors (seismic and passive acoustic) shall be capable of detecting the presence of personnel and vehicles traveling on dirt, gravel, sand and asphalt.  Sensors shall be capable of detecting, with a 90% probability of detection in each case, personnel movement within a 50 foot radius, wheeled vehicle movement within a 100 foot radius and tracked vehicle movement within a 500 foot radius. The sensor shall be capable of discriminating contacts by type (personnel versus tracked vehicle versus wheeled vehicle) with high probability of discrimination.  Signature Requirements.  Sensor shall be easily concealable in potential operational environments.  Sensor shall not be detectable by a human using a thermal viewing device at a range of 5 feet.  Sensor shall not be visually detectable by a human with normal visual acuity at a range of 5 feet.  Size, weight and power requirements.  Individual units making up the sensor suite shall be capable of being carried and emplaced manually by one person. Sensors/sensor clusters shall operate unattended a minimum of thirty days.  For installation flexibility, each individual sensor/sensor cluster shall have a dedicated  power source capable of meeting the thirty day requirement under normal operating conditions.  Mechanically, each sensor/cluster shall support connection of other power sources to support longer mission times.  Power sources shall be compliant with applicable MIL-STD requirements for the power type selected.  The system shall support power source replacement while in the field and without special tooling.  Individual sensors shall be capable of transmitting a low-battery alert back to the monitoring station.  Sensor wire and RF connections shall be MIL-STD compliant.  Electromagnetic Compatibility Requirements.  Individual Sensor Suites may be deployed either stand-alone or in close proximity to other Sensor Suites.  The Sensor System RF architecture employed shall allow for multiple sensor suites to operate in close proximity to each other while minimizing RF interference between the systems. The proposed Sensor System shall operate in RF bands approved for Unattended Ground Sensors, or unlicensed bands.  The vendor shall indicate in his response the frequency band the equipment operates in. Supportability Requirements.  The unattended ground sensor system shall be able to be deployed under cover of darkness by 1 person with 8 hours or less of training and wearing protective clothing and gear (e.g., gloves, heavy coats).  Threshold requirement is less then 15 minutes required to install any system component.  It is not intended that the field installer has to return to the monitoring station to verify correct sensor operation after installation.  The system shall provide a means for field installers to verify operation of the individual sensor/cluster locally, within short range of the installed sensor.  The installer will be able to perform a quick health/welfare check of the installed sensor/cluster as well as locally receive any alerts generated by the sensor/cluster.  The device the operator uses for local access to the sensors should be small, lightweight, ruggedized and commercially available. As technology advances, the Marine Corps may wish to incorporate new sensor types into the baseline Sensor Suite.   To facilitate addition of new sensors, the system architecture shall be non-proprietary.  At a minimum, this means use of only non-proprietary interfaces.   The objective capability shall be non-proprietary interfaces, components, and software.  Sensor data display.  The Sensor System shall come with a software application that allows the operator to collect, analyze, and display the sensor data using an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).  Equipment possessing some or all of the following additional capabilities, ranked in order of decreasing importance, is desired: The Sensor System architecture shall support incorporation of a passive-infrared (PIR) sensor with detection range of 50 meters for humans and 100 meters for vehicles.   Size/Weight/Power requirements listed above apply for this sensor.   Additional capabilities desired include direction of motion indicator and number of objects detected in a specific timeframe, with the timeframe operator-selectable.  The sensor system architecture shall support addition of electro-optic/infrared (EO/IR) cameras to augment the situational awareness capabilities of the baseline system.  The System architecture shall support triggering of frame capture for system cameras based on alerts from system sensors.  The system communications architecture shall support transmission of individual frames back to the monitoring station.  The system architecture shall provide the operator the capability to turn on and off and tailor this capability as required to maximize battery life of the EO/IR stand-alone sensor.  EO/IR sensors selected should be as small and concealable as possible.  The Sensor System shall have the ability to incorporate a Passive Acoustic Counter Sniper detection sensor able to detect firing of a rifle within a radius of 500 meters.   Size/Weight/Power requirements listed above apply for this sensor. The Sensor System shall have the ability to incorporate a Passive IR Flash Detection sensor.  Size/Weight/Power requirements listed above apply for this sensor.  The Sensor System shall have the ability to incorporate a Passive Acoustic Artillery Detection sensor.  Sensors selected should be as small and concealable as possible.  The Sensor System shall have the ability to incorporate a magnetic sensor with detection ranges of five meters for armed humans and 50 meters for vehicles.  Size/Weight/Power requirements listed above apply for this sensor.   Any sensor within a sensor suite shall be able to determine its geo-location automatically and transmit this data back to monitoring station.  This alleviates the need for the installer to manually record sensor positions. The NAICS code for this requirement is 334511 with a size standard of 750 employees.  Interested parties should submit the following information: (1) A list of equipment, with model numbers, to meet the requirements specified above.  The list should note any equipment that is not off-the-shelf, i.e., equipment that must be developed to satisfy this requirement.  The vendor should list the overall Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the proposed equipment and backup information to support selection of that level; (2) Specifications for each of the proposed sensors.  Incorporate a table in the response listing each sensor requirement in this document next to the proposed sensors corresponding specification.   Vendor should indicate cases where the proposed sensor exceeds minimum requirements set forth in this document.  Where military standards are listed in this requirement, indicate which military standards the proposed equipment meets, whether the equipment has been tested against those mil standards, and results.   Provide Size, Weight and Power figures for individual units making up the sensor system.  Include details on the proposed power source; (3)  Rough order of magnitude costs for the offered equipment set.  Provide separate pricing for discrete sensor units or sensor clusters, repeaters, and any base station units required.  Include cost of ancillary equipment such as power sources.  Vendor should provide the cost break quantities where increases in quantity purchased decreases the unit cost of the systems. Estimate of time from contract award to delivery of equipment to the Government; (4) Any available data on Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and Mean time between Failure (MTBF) on individual system units.  Any data on system Availability, including whether data is derived or actuals; (5) Include quantity of production level units sold and, if releasable, end user of the equipment; (6) The vendor, in their response, should provide a probability of detection, probability of false detection and probability of correct discrimination for the proposed sensors and list conditions under which these probabilities were calculated and/or measured.  Vendor is encouraged to address algorithms used to improve detection/discrimination/false alarm rate parameters in their response and any filtering used to decrease noise environment in which sensors operate.  Filtering of background noise becomes an important capability when operating the Sensor System in an urban environment; (7) Provide environmental specifications on the proposed system components, to the individual unit level; (8)  Security.  Vendors response should address any Communications Security and/or Transmission Security features of the proposed system.   Vendors response should address any capabilities built into the sensor to monitoring station data link (as well as the individual sensor interface) to minimize RF jamming; (9) Electromagnetic Compatibility.  Vendors response should indicate how proposed system addresses multiple sensor systems operating in close proximity.  For equipment operating in the UGS bands, the vendor shall indicate whether it is specification compliant with the band and, if not, what areas it exceeds spec in; (10) Vendors including any of the optional sensors as part of their proposed system should provide manufacturer, model number and cost for the proposed sensor.  Vendor should detail how the optional sensors integrate into the base system and indicate whether an additional communications capability beyond that proposed for the baseline system is required to transmit this sensor data back to the monitoring station.

<DESC>On-Site Support of the Test and Evaluation (T&E) Facility in Cincinnati, Ohio
THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a "market search" for large and small businesses in preparation for a future procurement.
The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide the Office of Research and Development (ORD); National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), with technical support to operate and conduct environmental research, testing, evaluation, development, and demonstration verification studies in support of NRMRL's mission at its Test and Evaluation (T&E) Facility located at 1600 Gest Street, Cincinnati, Ohio along with support to other NRMRL Cincinnati satellite facilities (Center Hill Facility, Experimental Streams Facility, Full-Containment Facility).  Research efforts can encompass bench-,  pilot- and field scale studies on innovative technologies, as well as larger scale studies when required to field test and demonstrate technologies. Contractor involvement will range from a minimum of project coordination and facilitation to full design, implementation, and operation.  
Most of the actual testing and evaluation will take place at the T&E Facility; however, some of the preliminary preparations and follow up activities, such as report writing and data analysis, may take place in the contractor's home office.  Occasionally, evaluations and demonstrations will be conducted at field locations depending upon specific project requirements.  The Contractor shall also provide support in research related concerns of health, safety, permits, and environmental compliance for locations mentioned above.  The T&E Facility's capabilities are available to public and private sector clients who may wish to conduct studies or participate in areas of research in which the T&E Facility is uniquely qualified and permitted to work.
Specific areas to be addressed in capability packages are as follows: 
(1) Conducting day-to-day operation of  test and evaluation facilities of similar scope including tracking of visitors, conducting tours, tracking/assembly/installation/maintenance/decontamination of equipment, tracking supplies including safety supplies to support facility operations; 
(2) Conducting controlled studies and testing and evaluation of pilot- and bench-scale water supply treatment and distribution system studies and wastewater treatment, pollution control, and other related technologies; 
(3)  Operation and maintenance of a simulated water distribution system related to watersecurity research issues; 
(4) Expertise in project design, including project specific literature review or technologyassessment, engineering analysis, sampling and analysis plans, project specific health andsafety plans, quality assurance project plans, and project scheduling; 
(5) Field testing of bench- and pilot-scale unit processes, treatment systems,and monitoring systems;  
(6) Support for emergency response activities, health and safety requirements, and tomaintain permit and compliance requirements for activities such as on-site chemicalinventory tracking and control, and on-site hazardous waste tracking.
The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A draft PWS can be obtained from the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) starting June 1, 2009 with a one year Base Period and four 12 month Optional Periods.  Approximately 7,980 base LOE hours are anticipated for the base year and 10,230 LOE hours for each of the four (4) optional years for a total of 48,900 base LOE hours.  In addition, 71,415 optional hours are anticipated for the base year and 126,935 LOE hours for each of the four (4) optional years for a total of 579,155 optional LOE hours.  Any interested firms shall submit a capability statement that demonstrates the firm's ability to perform the requirements described above. 
The applicable NAICS code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Any interested firms shall submit a capability package which demonstrates the firm's ability to perform the key requirements as described above.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.  In the capabilities statements, contractors shall provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women-owned, small-disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14).  
The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses.  Responses to the above shall be submitted to Scott Fogle, at fogle.scott@epa.gov no later than 21 calendar days from the date of posting.  A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources sought synopsis.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVALIABLE.  The DRAFT Scope of Work is for information purposes only and is subject to change.  The solicitation number for this announcement is W912EE-08-R-0004.  The VCO solicits for Capability Statements from all qualified and interested HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, and 8(a) small business firms to participate in a Best Value solicitation to provide all technical expertise, planning, supervision, labor, equipment, transportation, procurement services, and other resources for the operation, maintenance, and repair of facilities, equipment, and Government-owned property at the Lindy Claiborne Boggs Lock and Dam, the John H.

The NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 561210, Facilities Support Services, and the small business size standard is $32.5 Mil.  Federal Supply Code is Z299, Maintenance, Repair or Alteration of Real Property.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 50% of the contract work with his-or-her own employees.  The Government anticipates awarding a contract for one base year and four option years using a Best Value source selection process that will result in award of a firm-fixed price contract to the responsive responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, offers the Best Value to the Government, technical, past performance, and price considered.  <BR><BR>The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions to solicit these projects as either HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, 8(a), or small business set-asides.  The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements as indicated in the Scope of Work to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and past performance references.  Respondents must include references and a capability statement for at least two completed or current projects, for which your firm was the prime contractor (or a major subcontractor) within the last three years of work similar in size, scope and complexity.

Proof of SBA certification for 8(a) and/or HubZone status must also be included.  <BR><BR>The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the companys ability to demonstrate existing or developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified in the Scope of Work.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities Statement.  Submission of a Capabilities Statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the VCO in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran, or 8(a) firms or proceed with competition among all small business firms.  Respondents will not be notified of the Sources Sought results.<BR><BR>Submissions that do not meet all requirements or submit within the allotted time will not be considered.  Electronic submissions via email will be accepted, facsimile submissions will not.

In accordance with applicable federal acquisition regulation guidance, companies normally form a contractor team arrangement before submitting an offer.  However, subject to when the arrangement occurs in the acquisition process and responsible contracting officer approval, if needed, vendors may enter into an arrangement later in the acquisition process, to include after contract award.<BR><BR>Contracted effort requires that all contractor employees possess at a minimum a Security Clearance Classification of Secret, with some requirements for both Top Secret and Top Secret-Special Compartmentalized Information (TS-SCI).  Some contracted effort may require secret storage.<BR><BR>This acquisition is not open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  In order to be considered for award, contractor employees must possess (or be able to possess) at a minimum a Security Clearance Classification of Secret, with some requirements for both Top Secret and Top Secret-Special Compartmentalized Information (TS-SCI).

Description:

Note:  This special notice is also cross-referenced as INFORMATION SUPPORT SERVER ENVIRONMENT (ISSE) GUARD research & development.  Additionally, the Government contemplates the use of NAICS Code 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services.

This Notice does not restrict the Government regarding the ultimate acquisition approach that may be taken in the future.  No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation at this time.  

This is a Request for Information, a market survey for written information only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information provided except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

This announcement is issued for the purpose of  the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) seeking industry input regarding the best commercial practices for Information Support Server Environment (ISSE) Guard software enhancement, development, implementation, and support for the Air Force Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Agency’s Combat ISR Office, the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, and existing ISSE user sites at approximately 150 locations. This effort supports Air Force efforts in providing commands with required Cross-Domain ISR information and capability, when and where it is needed.

This Inter-domain information sharing program will enhance the current ISSE Guard at the Unified and Major Commands and their subordinate units and maintain the current ISSE Guard sites.  Software development, integration, deployment and maintenance will be provided for the ISSE Guard. It will be necessary to provide analysis, design, development, integration management, system and network administration/operation, technical documentation and testing to support the maintenance and evaluation of existing systems and of new development systems. In the course of performance, the contractor will interface with various agencies and commands throughout the DoD through electronic means and visits to various DoD and U.S. Intelligence Community sites worldwide. The contractor will also provide technical support to AFRL/Information and Intelligence Exploitation Branch (RIE) in the analysis, design, development, integration, testing and evaluation.  Anticipated deliverables include software and technical documentation.

Given this context, and based on your experience with similar work, we would like your company’s response to the following questions:

    1.  What do you think would be an appropriate contract type to use, and why?

    2.  What technologies (commercial or otherwise) are available that could apply to this program?

    3.  What performance objectives, performance standards, thresholds, and metrics should be used to allow for a reliable method for evaluating contractor performance, measuring performance outcomes, and providing contractor incentives for superior performance?

    4.   What would be considered effective contractor performance surveillance methods?

    5.  What are some effective commercial surveillance methods?

    6.  If a customer survey is used as a surveillance method, what would be some recommended customer survey questions?

    7.  What are the customary commercial business practices for procuring custom programming services in a fast-changing environment, where detailed requirements are not known in advance?

Technical questions should be directed to the Laboratory Program Manager, John Woodruff at 315-330-7156, e-mail John.Woodruff@rl.af.mil.  Contractual questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Joseph Austin, at 315-330-4310, e-mail Joseph.Austin@rl.af.mil.

This announcement is issued for the purpose of  the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) seeking industry input regarding the best commercial practices for Information Support Server Environment (ISSE) Guard software enhancement, development, implementation, and support for the Air Force Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Agency’s Combat ISR Office, the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, and existing ISSE user sites at approximately 150 locations. This effort supports Air Force efforts in providing commands with required Cross-Domain ISR information and capability, when and where it is needed.

This Inter-domain information sharing program will enhance the current ISSE Guard at the Unified and Major Commands and their subordinate units and maintain the current ISSE Guard sites.  Software development, integration, deployment and maintenance will be provided for the ISSE Guard. It will be necessary to provide analysis, design, development, integration management, system and network administration/operation, technical documentation and testing to support the maintenance and evaluation of existing systems and of new development systems. In the course of performance, the contractor will interface with various agencies and commands throughout the DoD through electronic means and visits to various DoD and U.S. Intelligence Community sites worldwide. The contractor will also provide technical support to AFRL/Information and Intelligence Exploitation Branch (RIE) in the analysis, design, development, integration, testing and evaluation.  Anticipated deliverables include software and technical documentation.

Given this context, and based on your experience with similar work, we would like your company’s response to the following questions:

    1.  What do you think would be an appropriate contract type to use, and why?

    2.  What technologies (commercial or otherwise) are available that could apply to this program?

    3.  What performance objectives, performance standards, thresholds, and metrics should be used to allow for a reliable method for evaluating contractor performance, measuring performance outcomes, and providing contractor incentives for superior performance?

    4.  What would be considered effective contractor performance surveillance methods?

    5.  What are some effective commercial surveillance methods?

    6.  If a customer survey is used as a surveillance method, what would be some recommended customer survey questions?

    7.  What are the customary commercial business practices for procuring custom programming services in a fast-changing environment, where detailed requirements are not known in advance?

Technical questions should be directed to the Laboratory Program Manager, John Woodruff at 315-330-7156, e-mail John.Woodruff@rl.af.mil.  Contractual questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Joseph Austin, at 315-330-4310, e-mail Joseph.Austin@rl.af.mil.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the electric distribution system for the Georgia Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at Savannah International Airport (IAP), to Georgia Power.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. Georgia Power (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The electric system being privatized is described as follows The Savannah ANG Base installation occupies 280 acres of leased land in the outheast and northeast quadrants of the Savannah IAP in Chatham County Georgia, approximately seven miles northwest of the city of Savannah.  It is home to two organizations, the 165th Airlift Wing (AW) and the Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC).  The mission of the 165th AW is to provide tactical and strategic air transport for airborne forces, equipment, and supplies.  The unit currently flies C-130H aircraft.  The mission of the CRTC is to provide combat aircrew training for Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation.  Savannah IAP (ANG) has 105 buildings totaling approximately 669,743 square feet.  An additional administration facility is under construction and projected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2008.  This facility is 35,013 SF and when completed will bring the total square footage at base to 704,756 SF.<BR><BR><BR><BR>These include 28 transient housing, 5 services, 45 industrial, and 26 administrative facilities. Current base population is 310 personnel.  This number surges to 1000 personnel during ANG drill weekends that occur once each month.  Savannah ANGB is a uniquely configured base consisting of 12 tracts of ANG leased land. Each tract is fenced or physically separated from the others by roads, airfield pavements, or commercial/industrial areas.  While the majority of the on-base electrical distribution system is already privatized (through Georgia Power Company), lines supporting the Fire Station and each of two Barrier Arresting Cables and some of the lines within the two tracts located on the northeast side of the airport adjacent to Robert B. Miller, Jr. Road are not.  On these tracts (on the northeast side of the airport), Savannah IAP (ANG) ownership begins at the output side (base side) of the three disconnect switches located on a power pole 170 feet southeast of Building 1925 and 90 feet west of Robert B. Miller, Jr. Road.  The system is a grounded WYE and consists of approximately 16,500 linear feet of underground wiring; 9,450 linear feet in duct banks (with warning tape) and 7,025 linear feet of direct-bury cable (also with warning tape).  The average depth of the electrical lines is 3 feet with a 2-foot minimum and a 5-foot maximum.  Incoming voltage is 13.2 kV.  The system also consists of seven pad mounted transformers ranging from 25 to 500 kVA, 11 manholes and two electric vaults.  Base personnel indicate the system capacity is adequate to meet current and future demands.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2001 and no offers were received.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution system, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>Interested sources shall contact: <BR> MSgt Denise Phillips, denise.phillips@gasava.ang.af.mil,  912-966-8272 or 912-220-1940.<BR>

<a href="mailto:raymond.molitoris@conus.army.mil">US Army C-E LCMC Acquisition Center - DAAB07</a>
<DESC>`<BR>The Acquisition Center posted a sources sought notice seeking potential sources that could meet Deep Speak Program requirements and performances metrics. This noticed was posted on 29 April 2008 until 23 May 2008, for a period of time of approximately 25 days. As a result of this effort a number of sources responded to this sources sought notice.  A performance work statement was provide to each new source requesting Deep Speak requirement documentation. The DARPA Program Manager and his SETA specialists researched for technical expertise and experience related to these new potential sources to the technologies needed in the Deep Speak Program to meet the performance requirements. As a result none of these new potential sources are competitive with the state of the current developer to complete the Deep Speak prototype development. None of these new potential sources have existing technologies that match what the current developer has developed under the first two phases of this program, nor could they create the prototype system without significant cost increase or schedule impact. The DARPA Program Manager and his SETA specialists have been closely monitoring technical developments and research in this area, largely through personal interactions with developers and academic communities as well as participation in relevant technical conferences such as the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing and various military and civilian communications conferences.  It is DARPA IPTO position that none of the new sources have the required unique expertise in demonstrating Deep Speak technologies without duplicating initial research efforts. Any other source than the current developer would fail to capitalize on the initial investment, potentially leading to schedule delays to get to the same technology status that the current developer already possesses in this area. It is anticipated that such an effort would also result in duplication of costs that would not be recovered through competition and could introduce additional risk in meeting the program's requirements.  Therefore, there is no competition anticipated for this acquisition that would be both more cost effective and technically superior than the current developer. No commercial item in the marketplace can meet Deep Speak requirements. Consequently, based on this DARPA IPTO experience and expertise, the current contractor is the only source that can meet the Governments requirement.<BR>

<a href="mailto:jason.white@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 2, is looking to enter into negotiations with a qualified Architect/Engineer firm specializing in hazardous materials abatement.  This contract would be for survey work, drawings, planning, and any other relevant work/information needed to prepare a contractor under a separate contract to successfully and comprehensively abate all asbestos, lead, or any other identified hazardous substance identified from two outbuildings on the Samuel S. Stratton VA Medical Center campus in Albany, NY.  The relevant NAICS code is 541310 (Architectural Services).Interested offerors are invited to submit complete qualification packets (SF 330) on or before July 7, 2008 to the following address:Jason V. White, Contract SpecialistSamuel S. Stratton VA Medical Center113 Holland Ave., Room C67Albany, NY 12208Electronic submissions will also be accepted at Jason.White@va.gov.  Electronic submissions should reference the RFP number in the subject line of the email.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.Offerors will be evaluated primarily based on the hazardous material abatement experience/ability evident in the proposed team, supplied past performance, and educational/professional qualifications submitted.  Other areas of expertise may be considered, but will carry significantly less weight.  As such, submitted qualification packets should focus on this specific skill set in both qualification information and past performance examples.The VA will evaluate submitted proposals by forming an evaluation team following shortened selection procedures as described in FAR part 36 and the associated sections of the VAAR.  In-person interviews/oral presentations are not anticipated, as the overall cost of this design is expected to fall below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.  Submission of pricing proposals and negotiations will be held with the highest-rated offeror after evaluations take place, and as such THIS POSTING IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND NO RFP IS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION.  The VA reserves the right to consider qualification packages already on file from prior projects this fiscal year alongside those received in direct response to this solicitation.  Firms with qualification packages already on file may submit responses to this posting highlighting specific hazardous waste experience, but are not required to.  This is a time-sensitive project and offerors are expected to be able to work under a tight schedule while making this project a high priority.

L. 106-523, 114 Stat. 2488, codified at 18 U.S.C. 3261 – 3267, as implemented by DoD Instruction 5525.11, “Criminal Jurisdiction over Civilians Employed by or accompanying the Armed Forces outside the United States.”  

ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
	
(1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

(2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets, said cost to be included in the offered rate.

ADD: SECURITY THREAT.  

In the event of a security threat or incident involving the ship, crew or cargo during the voyage, the ship's master should report any incident immediately to the MSC Area Command in whose area the ship is currently located.

ADD:  SALVAGE.

(1) When engaged in the carriage of government cargo and if requested by Charterer, Owner agrees to accept Navy salvage services.  Such services may be provided using Navy personnel and resources or Navy contracted resources.

(2) In providing such services, the Navy, through Charterer, agrees to waive all claims for “pure” or “bonus” salvage.  Instead, Charterer shall be entitled to the following:

a. In those cases in which the salvage services are provided by Navy personnel and resources, the salvage claim shall be limited to a schedule of current per diem rates and allowable expenses as established by the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage.  In no event shall such amount exceed a maximum claim of $25,000 per day.

b. In those situations in which the Navy utilizes contracted resources to deliver assistance, Owner shall be liable for the actual daily rate charged to the Navy by the contractor(s).

(3) It is understood that this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim is asserted against the vessel only, is solely for the vessel's account, and does not include any amounts for the salvage of the Government's cargo.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim IS NOT directly or by way of setoff chargeable in whole or in part to the Government by way of general average or otherwise.

ADD: DEMURRAGE/DETENTION DOCUMENTATION.  

In the event of demurrage/detention, all supporting documents as identified in the invoicing clause shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to submission of demurrage/detention invoices.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-25.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Visible Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging System. ***

Background:

NIST’s Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology requires a microscope-mountable visible-frequency and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging system able to perform simultaneous collection of spectral information from each pixel of an image.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

 Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Visible Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging System, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:

1.	The system shall be designed to acquire a hyperspectral image of a sample placed under an optical microscope. The hyperspectral image shall be defined as a set (“data cube”) of two-dimensional spatial images of a fixed area of the sample, each image corresponding to a different spectral window of the collected light. A spectral window is characterized is by a discrete center wavelength and a full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) width also referred to as spectral resolution. 

2.	A given hyperspectral image shall be collected in a single, computer-controlled, spectral-analysis sweep (“ run”).  During a single run, it shall be possible to acquire at least 16 bits of spectral data per pixel. In addition, it shall be possible to sample no less than 80 discrete spectral windows with different user-definable center wavelengths. 

3.	Imaging and spectral acquisition shall be polarization insensitive. 

4.	The basic spectral imaging function shall be achieved using a computer-controlled scanning-mirror, fast-fourier-transform (FFT) interferometer (“optical head”) followed by a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera, both furnished with the system. The optical head shall be designed to connect directly to an output port of a user-supplied optical microscope, using a vendor supplied 1.0 X C-mount.  

a.	A common-path interferometer (with transmitted and reflected beams traveling along the same path in space), such as a Sagnac interferometer, is preferred due to its inherent stability compared to other types of interferometers. 
b.	Spectral analysis schemes involving liquid-crystal tunable filters are unacceptable because of intrinsic transmission losses and polarization sensitivity. 
c.	Any scheme involving filter wheels is also unacceptable due to lack of flexibility. 

5.	To ensure the mechanical stability of the user-provided optical microscope platform, the optical head shall weigh no more than 5 kg. 

6.	During a run, spectra shall be collected simultaneously at each spatial pixel of the image, without any need for sequential spatial scanning of the sample or the sample illumination. In other words, the scanning-mirror interferometer shall process the entire input image in parallel.

7.	Direct, live observation of the input image by the CCD camera (i.e. bypassing the interferometer pathway), shall be possible.

8.	The spectral range accessible to the system shall be continuous and encompass at least the wavelength interval from 400 nm to 1000 nm. 

9.	System spectral accuracy shall be less than 2 nm.

10.	The spectral resolution shall be user selectable. Minimum (best) achievable resolution shall be:

a.	Less than 6 nm (FWHM) at a wavelength of 400 nm.
b.	Less than 20 nm (FWHM) at a wavelength of 780 nm.

For high speed, low-resolution data acquisition, it shall be possible to select a spectral resolution of no less than 50 nm across the entire wavelength range.   

11.	At least four narrow pass-band filters within the spectral range shall be provided for system calibration.

12.	To enable data-cube acquisition of fluorescence spectra covering the entire visible and near-infrared region (at least 450-800 nm), two (2) special-purpose, spectrally orthogonal, dual-band filter cubes shall be provided: one for the blue and red frequency regions, and one for the green and near-infrared frequency regions.

13.	A high quantum-efficiency high-resolution, low noise, cooled CCD camera shall be included with the system. Minimum specifications for the camera are:

a.	1.3 mega pixels
b.	Electrically cooled to at least -20 º C
c.	12-bit imaging
d.	Dynamic range &#61619; 65dB
e.	70% peak quantum efficiency (in green)
f.	Readout noise &#61603; 13 e
g.	Dark current no more than 0.1 e /pixel /sec

14.	Exposure times ranging from at least 2 to 10,000 ms shall be available. 

15.	System sensitivity shall be no less than 0.04 lux (for a 25ms exposure time).

16.	The system shall be controlled from a vendor-supplied PC workstation including a 20.1” flat-panel LCD monitor. Preferred operating system is Windows XP.  Minimum requirements for vendor supplied software shall be to pilot automatic data acquisition, display acquired images and spectra, as well as perform spectral un-mixing. 

17.	A minimum one-year warranty shall be offered.

The Contractor shall provide two days on-site at NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland, for the installation and training of NIST staff on the system, as follows:

The Contractor shall allow one half day for the installation of the system.  Installation shall include, at a minimum, uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of all equipment, system verification, and system check for manufacturing defects and any damage during shipment.  A performance check test shall be completed by the contractor at NIST at the time of installation, witnessed by a NIST representative.

The Contractor shall schedule and facilitate training sessions, of a day and half’s duration, for at least two (2) NIST researchers. The training shall provide a thorough demonstration of all equipment functions.  This must include a demonstration of all salient characteristics herein.  An extra day of advanced applications training at NIST, for two NIST researchers, shall also be made available within one year of installation.

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Public Hearing in the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Appeal to the Secretary of Commerce under the Coastal Zone Management Act<br />National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration<br />U.S. Department of Commerce</p>
<p>This statement of work is submitted in support of a contract for a conference center needed for a public hearing in an informal adjudication currently being administered by NOAA's Office of General Counsel on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.</p>

<p>On February 15, 2008, Foothill/Eastern Transportation Agency (TCA) filed a notice of appeal with the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), pursuant to section 307(c)(3)(A) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. &sect; 1456(c)(3)(A). TCA appealed an objection by the California Coastal Commission to the construction of an extension to California State Route 241 in northern San Diego and southern Orange Counties, California. Under the CZMA, the Secretary may override the Commission's objection on grounds that the project is consistent with the objectives or purposes of the CZMA or otherwise necessary in the interest of national security. NOAA's Office of the General Counsel administers the appeal on behalf of the Secretary.</p>
<p>The Secretary has 160 days from the date of publication of the notice of appeal in the Federal Register in which to close the decision record for the appeal. 16 U.S.C. &sect; 1465(b). Within this time frame, the Secretary must: (a) compile all relevant documentation; (b) obtain briefs from the parties; and (c) where appropriate, obtain comments from interested federal agencies and the public - including public hearings. This 160-day time frame may be extended for no more than 60 days. Upon request or upon his own initiative the Secretary may hold a public hearing. 15 C.F.R. &sect; 930.128 (d). When a hearing is held, the Secretary must provide the parties with at least 30 days notice of the time and place set for the hearing, and the public comment period must remain open for at least 10 days after the hearing. Id.; see also 15 C.F.R. &sect; 930.113(a). On May 21, 2008, the General Counsel of NOAA, on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce, issued an order granting a public hearing.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>It is necessary to hold the public hearing in the next six to eight weeks in order to complete the public hearing and the subsequent comment period (and any necessary follow-up procedures) before the record closes in this appeal on August 25, 2008. The closure of the decision record is a strict statutory deadline, and, due to recent amendments to the CZMA the Secretary is limited in his ability to extend this deadline. Once the record is closed the opportunity to react to comments received during the public hearing will be lost. Further, by regulation, the Secretary must provide at least 30 days notice of the time and place set for the hearing. 15 C.F.R. &sect; 930.113. <br /><br />Scope:</p>
<p>This statement of work is limited to one hearing spanning up to two days</p>
<p>Capabilities:<br />NOAA's Office of General Counsel has determined the following parameters are necessary for the selected hearing venue. The facility must:</p>
<p>1) be located within 35 miles of the intersection <br />of Interstate 5 and Camp Pendleton Marine <br />Corps Base,<br />2) have reasonable costs, <br />3) have capacity for 3,000 to 5,000 people,<br />4) be available on July 24 and July 25, 2006,<br />5) have parking nearby,<br />6) have public transportation nearby, <br />7) be located in close proximity to airports and <br />hotels, and<br />8) be air conditioned.</p>

Period of performance is July 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008 and includes two (2) pick-ups.</p>
<p>In December, 2005, NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) instituted an Environmental Management System (EMS) based on the International Organization for Standardization's ISO-14001:2004 EMS standard. (http://www.seco.noaa.gov/EMS/NOCCOS). The EMS requires all NCCOS facilities to conduct business in the most environmentally friendly manner possible, including the generation and disposal of chemical and biological waste. Therefore, the preferred method of disposal of generated waste is to recycle whenever possible, secondly disposal of chemical and biological materials using fuels blending by cement kilns where possible, and lastly by incineration. NO waste shall be disposed of by burial, ground injection, sent to land fills, or shipped outside the United States. All waste removed from the facility must be handled according to all applicable local, state, and federal regulations.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>1. The Contractor, and any NCCOS approved subcontractors, shall be appropriately licensed, permitted, and insured for the transport and temporary storage of hazardous waste involved. The Contractor is to maintain a list of NCCOS approved temporary and final disposal sites for each category of waste. NCCOS reserves the right of refusal of any disposal site(s) or to request alternate disposal site(s). Only sites approved by NCCOS and NOAA Regional Environmental Compliance Officers will be allowed. Use of a disposal facility that is not on the Contractor's NCCOS approved list or the use of unapproved disposal methods shall be cause for termination and forfeiture of payment(s). For approval of a new temporary storage facility or final disposal site, a written request shall be submitted to NCCOS, CCFHR, Attn: Joseph Bizzell, at least six (6) weeks prior to intended use. Email: Joseph.Bizzell@noaa.gov, phone: 252-728-8718.</p>

Liquid waste is to be listed on manifests by volume not weight.</p>
<p>3. Final disposal of appropriate bulk waste streams shall be as fuel by an NCCOS approved cement kiln. Final disposal of lab pack and other hazardous and nonhazardous waste are to be consolidated and disposed of at approved facilities by the following order of priority: recycled whenever possible, supplied a fuel for cement kilns, or fuel blended. Waste shall be incinerated when either of these disposal methods is not possible.

The following FAR provisions apply 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.217-5, and 52.217-9. Purchase/Acquisition of Professional Consultant Services to Provide Master Planning Support to Army Installations to include the development and Management of Installation Real Property Master Plans(RPMP). STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW): TITLED: Reinvigorating and Emphasis of Master Planning as part of the Military Construction Process. INTRODUCTION: The Office of the Chief of Engineers through the Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has the responsibility for providing master planning support to Army installations to include the development and management of installation Real Property Master Plans (RPMP). These responsibilities also include providing assistance to the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) and the Installation Management Command (IMCOM), which includes its Headquarters Staff, Regions, and Installations. Further, as per DoD 3020, the Army Corps of Engineers is the DoD Critical Infrastructure Protection (DCIP) lead for the Public Works Sector.  The DCIP role involves imbedding an Infrastructure assurance planning process throughout DoD (including the Army). One of the prime responsibilities is assuring the process of Master Planning is embedded into the Armys Military Construction and Real Estate processes.  The result of the process of Master Planning is a set of construction requirements that are implemented either through the Military Construction or Real Estate Programs.  Without a thorough understanding of the planning process, these construction or real estate initiatives are designed in a way that do not meet the long term needs of the Army, unsustainable and limit the Army options in an environment that is rapidly changing due to Transformation.  To better integrate Planning with the MILCON process, USACE is proposing a series of initiatives to enhance understanding of planning to other USACE Community of Practice professionals and 2) re-look Army and USACE planning policies, protocols and guidance to better define planning relationships and considerations into the MILCON process.  BACKGROUND: Army Installation Commanders are responsible for the short and long range planning of their installations, including real property, in support of current and future missions.   Installation Real Property Master Plans satisfy a multitude of requirements. To assist Installation Commanders, Headquarters, Department of the Army developed policy guidance for development of installation master planning.  Army Regulation 210-20 requires each installation to develop a Real Property Master Plan.  The RPMP is the Installation Commanders plan for the management and development of the real property assets of the installation, including land, facilities, and infrastructure.  Additionally, the RPMP documents the real property planning process.  The RPMP is comprised of the following components: Real Property Master Planning Digest (RPMPD); Long-Range Component (LRC); Installation Design Guide (IDG); Capital Investment Strategy (CIS); and the Short Range Component (SRC). Further, as per AR 210-20, the Commander, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is designated the technical lead for the practice of planning, to assure best planning practices are followed by the Army including USACE design and construction professionals.  This includes assuring that planning principles are imbedded into all design and construction activities provided by USACE and providing advice to the Army on appropriate planning practices. The Commander U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued Operational Order (ORORD 2006-13) to the Command on MILCON TRANSFORMATION. This OPORD directed all MSCs guidance and direction for implementing the MILCON Transformation Program.  One annex (Annex L) provided the guidance on USACE Master Planning program to support implementing Army MILCON transformation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>SSA-RFQ-08-1386 – Amendment 2

The purpose of this amendment is to provide vendor question’s and the Government’s response’s. The amendment will also revise the specifications for line item 1 and 3.

Vendors are reminded they must acknowledge receipt of solicitation amendments in their quote. As a result of this amendment the closing date remains Thursday, May 22, 2008, at 12pm as referenced in Amendment 1. 
	

IMPORTANT  NOTICE TO VENDORS WHO MAY ALREADY HAVE SUBMITTED A QUOTE:  1)  If the information in this amendment does not cause you to have to revise your quote you should send an email to the contract specialist acknowledging receipt of the amendment and include a statement that your original dated quote is unchanged as a result of the amendment; or 2)  If the information in this amendment is cause for you to change your quote you may submit a revised quote CLEARLY marked as “REVISED BASED ON INFORMATION IN AMENDMENT 2” and include a statement that your original quote should not be considered.  

1. Vendor question: 

The spec calls that the faucet should not be for a single cockhole. Does this mean you would like to have the 4” escutcheon plates option priced with the faucets? 

Government response:  

The specification as originally posted was incorrect. The faucet should mount in a SINGLE cockhole only. The specification has been revised to read “the faucet should be for a single cockhole.”  

2. Vendor question: 

Regarding the spec for quantity 300 (daisy chain) connectors:  the connectors look like 3 cables tied into a central hub.  The way I am bidding the faucets one of these assemblies (3 cable one hub) comes with each faucet.  Those cables are enough to link all one hundred faucets.  Do you want this or do you really want 300 additional cable assemblies and hubs? 

Government response:  

Quantity is 300 as specified. The daisy chain connectors link Faucet to Faucet to Faucet to Transformer in series.
 

3. Vendor question: 

For Item #2 on the Solicitation (Connecting Cables), depending on the brand of faucet that is quoted, generally one power supply/transformer will power 6 or 8 faucets.  I just wanted to re-verify that in that case you will need a quantity of 300 [Connecting Cables]. 

Government response:  

See question #2.

4. Vendor question: 

For Item #3 (Water Tubing), is there an acceptable length of the 120’ ft copper tubing that we can ship it?  (i.e. 10’ ft lengths, etc.) 

Government response:  

Nothing shorter than 10’ in length for the copper tubing. 

 
Revised:

REQUIREMENT: ITEM #1- Faucets (Qty. 100) • Must have modular construction with all concealed components above deck. • Double infrared sensors with automatic setup and indicator light. • Automatic self-adapting sensor technology. • Magnetic solenoid valve. • Water supply connections with flexible high pressure hoses and strainer for hot and cold. • 6 volt DC plug-in transformer that could accommodate electrical connections up to 6 faucets. • Should have integral spout mixer. • No pop-up drain. • 5 9/16” from cock hole to aerator outlet. • Height 6 7/8” • The faucet should be for single cock hole.


ITEM #3- Water tubing • 120’ ft type “L” copper ½” (Individual cuts no less than 10’ in length)

<DESC>The following questions were received:

1. For Cleaning between rental months as indicated, can you clarify the frequency of cleaning please.  Is cleaning required Once Monthly, or between rotations of residents only?  

The units at a minimum shall be cleaned every two weeks.  This is changed from the previous SOW.  Cleaning services offered in excess should be indicated in "additional amenities."

2.  How often will residents be rotated through the apartment during the one year lease, or what is each individuals estimated length of stay? 

Varies, for the initial rotation it will be two month intervals with 6 residents total the first year. 

3. The solicitation indicates that the unit must be within one block of public transportation, and that two parking spots be included for the apartment.  As most communities charge extra for a second parking space, and that cost would need to be built into each provider's rate, do you anticipate the second spot being utilized given the emphasis on public transportation?  (This is more a consideration for the overall requirement.)  

Yes, both spots are required.  And the proximity to public transportation is a must as well.  Some students will be using their own transportation and others will require public transportation.

4.  Can quotes be e-mailed or faxed?

The preference is for quotes to be e-mailed, micreenan@usuhs.mil, but if this option is not available you may fax your quote to 301.295.1716.

<DESC>T-1A Trainer Aircraft Modification to Add Combat Systems Officer (CSO) Training Capability
This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirements to modify twenty-one T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include an on-board Combat Systems Officer training station for use by United States Air Force (USAF) personnel and generate the associated technical data. The level of security clearance and amount of foreign participation in this requirement has not been determined.

The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.
INSTRUCTIONS:
1.	Below is a document containing a description of CSO requirement and a Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your companys capability.
2.	If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your companys capability in meeting these requirements.  Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)
3.	Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research.  Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.
4.	Questions relative to this market research should be addressed to John Webb at (937) 904-4254.



REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTIONT-1A Aircraft Modification to Add CSO Training Capability
PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
           We are conducting market research to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to modify T-1A Trainer Aircraft to include a Combat Systems Officer (CSO) training station and generate the associated technical data. The CSO will combine Navigator, Electronic Warfare and Weapons System Officer training using specially configured T-1A aircraft and ground based training assets.  Twenty-one T-1A aircraft will be modified with global positioning system driven simulated radar display and a simulated Radar Warning Receiver (ALR-69) display in the flight deck right seat position with instructor controls at the jump seat position.  An additional CSO and instructor position will be located in the cabin using the T-25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (SECT) or some other device with similar capabilities.  The ground based training system portion consists of up to three operational flight trainers.  The flight trainers will not be part of this acquisition.    The CSO system needs to be fielded at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola in time to support training as the T-43 Training System shuts down at Randolph AFB beginning in 2010.  Ten modified aircraft are required for Initial Operational capability (IOC) in 2010 with all 21 aircraft modified and in place for Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2011.
	Hawker Beechcraft Corporation holds the FAA Type Certificate for the aircraft and the Government does not have data rights for the technical / engineering data on the aircraft.  The CSO solution must be FAA certified as integrated into the T-1 aircraft.

This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks.  Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.

QUESTION:  How do I bid on the projectANSWER:  Please download the "RFP" and follow the "Offerors provide the following sections of the solicitation" found on page 4.  Also, please see Instructions to Offerors found on page 51.  2.	QUESTION:  What is the eligibility criteriaANSWER:  Please see E.3 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) found on page 53.  3.	QUESTION:  What is the contract obligationANSWER:  The Government cannot divulge its cost estimate for this procurement .  4.	QUESTION:  The information which you have failed to supply about the potential trips gives and ENORMOUS advantage to the incumbent, and creates a HUGE disadvantage for any company that does not have a trip history. While the incumbent knows how many trips they are able to put together (multi-load), as well as how many trips on average are inside the 15-mile radius, the outside company has no way of knowing how many or how often these types of trips occur. This level of disadvantage appears to be very biased toward the incumbent, although I am sure that this is not intended. I hope that you will reconsider your answer to #9 and allow some type of trip history. Otherwise, we will not be able to respond fairly and will assume, and allege, a government bias toward the incumbent. I will be happy to speak with you about this issue.ANSWER:

<CONTACT>Kenneth Carter, (202) 267-3012

<a href="mailto:kenneth.m.carter@faa.gov">kenneth.m.carter@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Special Reference is made to Previous Posting #:  6598.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to issue a requirement for the acquisition of a DC BUS (Back-Up-System) capable of suppressing transient voltage conditions.  The system shall continuously supply regulated Direct Current (DC) power to loads and shall be capable of providing power during loss or interruption of input Alternating Current (AC) by using energy stored in a battery bank.
The requirement is being considered for an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) consisting of a two-year base period and four two-year options periods for a total contract period not to exceed 10 years, or 120 months.      
The DC BUS System proposed under this requirement consists of Commercial-off-the- Shelf/Non-Developmental Item equipments containing the following:
	Rectifiers; distribution cabinets; distribution panels; inverters; remote monitor capability; control panel; AC wireway; DC wireway; battery shunt, a main system bus, battery disconnect panel; and a valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) battery, with a capacity range from 530 to 2100 Amp hours.	There is an optional component list consisting of a converter; distribution panel; and low voltage-disconnect contactor.	Other environmental requirements include - 
o	Storage ambient temperatures ranging from -20C to 70Co	Operating ambient temperatures ranging from 0C to 40Co	Operating ambient temperature batteries ranging from 15C to 27Co	Relative humidity conditions ranging from 5 to 95%, non-condensing; ando	Operating conditions at altitudes ranging between 0 and 3,300 feet without de-rating performance.
Special warranty provisions apply.  The Government's desired warranty is 2-years parts and labor after final delivery, installation and acceptance.
The Government contemplates a two tier technical evaluation of offers under this requirement.  The first tier evaluation will only consider proposals from small businesses.  If first tier evaluation results fail to achieve a minimum number of qualified offers, the evaluation will proceed to the second tier evaluation, which would include the consideration of large qualifying businesses, as well as any qualifying small businesses.  This process is further expanded on under Section M1.1 of the SIR.  
The anticipated issue date of the Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Offer (RFO) is 9 May, 2008, with a scheduled closing date of June 23, 2008.  A copy of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer can be located at:  http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm, on/or about the issue date noted above.       
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 335911; Storage Battery Manufacturing, with a small business size standard in number of employees of 500.
Interested sources are encouraged to review the SIR/RFO and provide questions or comments in writing to Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov, or via facsimile at: (202) 267-5420, by 1:00 p.m. EDST, 22 May 2008.  Comments should be submitted in either Microsoft Word 2003 or PDF format only.  (Note: The FAA will not respond to telephone inquiries.)  
All responses to the SIR/RFO must be submitted in accordance with page 1, Block 9, and Section L, "Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offers" of the SIR/RFO.
A Pre-Proposal Conference is scheduled under this requirement.  (See Section L for details.)

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to establish a Qualified Vendors List (QVL) for anticipated architectural and engineering services for various locations throughout the Western Logistics Service Area (WLSA).
General Information:  The FAA anticipates that projects governed by this QVL will arise in the WESTERN LOGISTICS SERVICE AREA (WLSA), comprised of the following states:  Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Washington, Colorado, Montana, California, Oregon, Wyoming, Nevada and Hawaii.  The work will be performed at civilian airports, so security clearances will be required and airport access requirements will have to be met.  
Work Requirements:  The A/E firm should be capable of providing services as described below.  The survey firm can receive solicitations from any FAA Contracting Officer within the WLSA.  If selected, the A/E firm may be required to travel where the FAA has A/E requirements and where the firm has indicated a preference to work.  If travel is required, then the most economical method of travel must be used.  Maximum per diem rates may not exceed the FAA travel rates allowed for FAA employees.  
Please see attached SIR for more details.

Additional Information:
- We would like to have a Complete Loss Run for the prior five years. This loss run would need to detail individual claims for each year. If possible,
we would like to see it in an Excel Spreadsheet format. Some critical elements contained in these loss runs would be:
      - Sorted by Year.
      - Claim Number
      - Incurred Amount
      - Paid Amount
      - Location/Territory of Incident.
      - Medical Payments/Reserves/Expenses
      - Indemnity Payments/Reserves/Expenses
      - Breakout/Designation of War Hazards Act Claims
      - Breakout/Designation of Claims by the Four Rating Classifications - Service, Security w/Aviation, Security
       w/o Aviation and Construction.
      - Summary of Incurred Losses greater than $100,000. per year.
Attached is a spreadsheet containing loss data from 2002 through 2007.

- Relative to Exposures we would like see:
      - Historical Payrolls for the last five years, per year.
This data is not available.

      - Those Historical Payrolls broken out by the four Rating Classifications: Service, Security w/Aviation, Security w/o Aviation and Construction.
Historically, there have been only services and construction categories.  The addition of the two security categories has only existed since January of this year and will only affect those security companies operating in Iraq or Afghanistan.

      - Concentration of Employees by country, jobsite and Flight concentration.
Data not available.

      - Nationalities - U.S. Nationals, Third Country Nationals and Local Nationals breakout.
There is no data on the numbers of nationalities of contractor employees

      - Do any restrictions exist relative to Flight Concentrations:
            - What is the maximum number of employees anyone conveyance?
This varies depending on the airframe and safety conditions.  Rotary wing aircraft generally operate with fewer occupants than seats available for medium lift.  Light helicopters (pilot, copilot and two passengers/gunners) generally operate with all four seats occupied. 
 
            - Types of Conveyance: Commercial or Military Aircraft?
Aircraft are not Military assets

      - A definitional statement relative to what the Classification "Security w/ Aviation" entails.
These are security contractors who are required to provide rotary winged aviation assets in support of their security mission.  Presently there is a single task order against a single security contract that requires aviation assets.

<CONTACT>Aaron H. Ford, Contracting Officer, Phone 2022545362, Email Aaron.Ford@dhs.gov
<DESC>DHS Science and Technology (S&T) is interested in receiving proposals for Long Range Science and Technology Projects and innovative prototypes which offer potential for advancement and improvement of homeland security missions and operations.  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare S&T's broad role in competitive funding of meritorious research across a spectrum of science and engineering disciplines.  The overall mission and goal of S&T is to identify revolutionary, evolving, and maturing technologies that can be demonstrated to provide significant improvement to homeland security missions and operations through proof of concept and prototyping with potential for transition to current and future DHS acquisition processes.  S&T will focus on those key areas where risk inhibits mission and operation investments and where significant capability payoffs can be expected for successful efforts.  Related technologies are being pursued by other elements of the US Government, and in those cases, DHS S&T will leverage and use those technology developments wherever it is practicable and efficient to do so.  S&T will also facilitate access to laboratory and operationally relevant test and evaluation facilities wherever reasonably available.
Topical Areas of strategic interest include:  

Explosives countermeasures, including the detection, mitigation, and response to explosive threats including manpads, home made explosives, improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers and vehicle borne improvised explosive devices.  

Chemical and Biological analyses and countermeasures, including improved characterization and prioritization of threats, development and detection systems for early attack warning that minimize exposure and speed treatment of victims, new forensic methods to support attribution, and novel concepts for decontamination and restoration, agrodefense, and food security.  

Border and Maritime Security technologies and tools that better secure our land and maritime ports of entry.  Concepts and prototypes for pilot testing surveillance and monitoring capabilities that cover vast expanses of remote border and the development and evaluation of security devices and new inspection methods to secure the large volume of cargo entering U.S. ports daily.  

Command, Control, & Interoperability for emergency responders, security and integrity of networked infrastructures, and the development of automated capabilities that "connect-the-dots" for threat detection.  

Human Factors analyses and techniques to improve detection, analysis, and understanding of threats posed by individuals, groups, and radical movements; preparedness, response and recovery of communities impacted by catastrophic events; and overall effectiveness of homeland security technologies through improved usability and application.  

Infrastructure Protection analyses and techniques for identifying and mitigating all hazard vulnerabilities of the 17 critical infrastructure and key assets that keep our society and economy functioning. 

Multiple awards are anticipated to be issued through this BAA.  This announcement will close on 12/31/2008.  White Paper and/or Full Proposals must be submitted no later than 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time by 12/31/2008.  NOTE:  There is a registration process (see Section IV of the BAA).  A Prospective Offeror must ensure that it will allow itself sufficient time to complete the registration and submission process.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), in support of the ProgramExecutive Office - Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence
(PEO-C4I), Networks, Information Assurance (IA), and Enterprise Services
Program Office (PMW 160), intends to competitively procure the design,
development and production of the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise
Services (CANES) system.

PMW 160 recently released the draft CANES Architecture Specification version
2.1 (AS v2.1) to the PMW 160 CANES Information Workspace Portal located at:

https://ncee.navy.mil/peos/C4I/PEO%20C4I%20workspace/pmw/pmw160welcome/pmw160pri
vate/CANES/default.aspx

The draft CANES AS v2.1 effectively translates the war fighter's fundamental
CANES mission requirements, as captured by the CDD, into specific engineering
requirements, while remaining at a level understandable by a wide range of
stakeholders and developers.

PMW 160 is interested in obtaining industry feedback regarding the draft CANES
AS v2.1 by scheduling one on one meetings with industry.  These feedback
meetings will be scheduled from 16 June 2008 through 18 July 2008 at dates,
times and locations to be mutually established between PMW 160 and the
company.  A CANES AS v2.1 feedback meeting with PMW 160 may be scheduled by
sending an email request to: rebecca_kaufman@sra.com., (619)293-7579 x130.
Meeting requests must be received before 17 July 2008.  No draft CANES AS v2.1
industry feedback meetings will be scheduled after 18 July 2008.  Meetings will
be limited to a maximum of ninety (90) minutes in duration.  Additional
instructions regarding the one-on-one feedback meetings will be provided via
email at the time the meeting is scheduled.  One-on-one meetings are for the
purpose of providing industry feedback to the Government regarding the draft
CANES AS v2.1 only.  No company capability demonstrations or marketing material
will be accepted or discussed during the one on one meetings.

<DESC>Request for additional Information (RFI) For Precision Guidance Kit (PGK)Increment 2
This is a consolidated RFI including original posting including amendments.

Original (Posted 06 MAY 08):
The US Army Joint Munitions & Lethality Life Cycle Management Command (JM&LLCMC) Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems is seeking information from Industry on their ability to develop and qualify a Precision Guidance Kit  Increment 2 (PGK-2) solution for 105mm HE projectiles with threshold requirements that will include a delivery accuracy of 30 meter CEP, GPS P(Y) SAASM, a 105mm deep intrusion fuze well depth, and Enhanced Projectile Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (EPIAFS) compatibility. The objective requirements for PGK-2 are to provide a single technical solution for all US 105mm and 155mm projectiles (HE and cargo) with an Anti Jam capability, short intrusion fuze well, and compatibility with the Non-Line of Sight - Cannon (NLOS-C) automatic handling systems.
The Government contemplates award of contract(s) in mid calendar year 2009. Theproposed acquisition strategy for PGK-2 will be broken out to represent the following:
The PGK-2 program consists of three phases. Phase 1 is expected to be approximately twelve months and consists of design maturation and a competitive shoot-off leading to a downselect to the best approach based on demonstrated accuracy and reliability, as well as, cost and potentially an assessment of design maturity (including size/weight/performance compliance of the overall design and subcomponents), compatibility with applicable 105mm and 155mm artillery projectiles, and the proposed countermeasure/anti-jam approach.  Phase 2 is expected to be approximately fifteen (15) to twenty four (24) months and consists of final design and qualification of a PGK-2 production representative system to support Milestone C.  The government anticipates requesting proposals for the design/qualification and initial production implementation for capabilities that are beyond the threshold capability of US 105mm HE projectiles.  These may include options for implementation of discrete objective capabilities listed below:
- GPS Anti Jam (design/qual and Initial production costs)-105mm cargo projectiles (design/qual and Initial production costs)-155mm cargo projectiles (design/qual and Initial production costs)-155mm HE projectiles (design/qual and Initial production costs)
Following a Milestone C decision, there is a planned Initial Production and Deployment (IP&D) Phase (3) that contains four production options (1 year per option). 
The government is interested in respondents assessment of the technical feasibility of implementing the following within the PGK-2 timeline given above:
-	Designs that are either compatible with current STANAG for cargo projectiles or an alternative approaches that will be compatible with the actual physical interface constraints on US cargo projectiles 
-	Size compliant and performance compliant designs during Phase 1
-	Inclusive of countermeasure/anti-jam demonstration in Phase 1
-	A GPS standard interface so that alternative GPS approaches/suppliers could easily be  integrated into PGK-2 designs during its evelopment/productionphases
-	Respondents should include information regarding the GPS jamming environment that their system can tolerate with their basic design and with possible added Anti-Jamming features includes the respective accuracy performance.  (Note:  The Excalibur Performance Spec Appendix C on GPS anti-jam for given scenarios is available as a comparison requirement to the emerging PGK-2 Anti-Jam objectives, which are likely to be similar). 
-	Respondents should include information regarding their solutions behavior and performance in a GPS jamming environment when GPS guidance is never attained. 
-	Respondents should discuss their solutions method of Anti-Jam and the maturity of their design.    (Note: the Navy Guidance Integrated Fuze (GIF) SBIR program has developed a performance specification for an anti-jam environment.  Through this program they have identified potential materiel solutions for projectile spin rate of up to 300 Hertz.)
The government is performing an analysis of restructuring the PGK program to deliver one HE (105mm and 155mm) PGK and one cargo (105mm and 155mm) PGK and is seeking industrys assessment of this approach.
Respondents should include information regarding any desired changes to the EPIAFS message set or other EPIAFS interface changes desired for the respondents solution (government makes no assurances that respondents desired EPIAFS changes can or will be implemented). 
Interested respondents may obtain the following upon request and coordination with POC listed below.  A Non-Disclosure Agreement (available upon request) signed an on file and a DD2345, and Form 1350 at a minimum, will be required:
-	PGK-2 DRAFT Performance Specification-	105MM Data Aero Coefficients-	105MM Weapon/ Projectile Interface-	155MM Data Aero Coefficients -	155MM Weapon/ Projectile Interface -	Interface Control Document (ICD) between Fuze Setter and Excalibur Increment Ib (M982E1) Extended Range Projectile, 12999868-	Operational analysis for 105mm Precision Guided Munitions-	Lessons Learned  Briefing for Gun Fired Smart Munitions-	GPS User Equipment Interface Control Document-	The Guided Integrated Fuze (GIF) RFP w/ alternative MOFA component TDP(s): HOB Portion of TDP-	Excalibur Performance Spec Appendix C on countermeasure/anti-jam 
The following information is also being finalized for release by the end of May 2008 and will be available provided a Non-Disclosure Agreement (available upon request) signed an on file and a DD2345 are submitted to POC listed below:
-	Physical Properties Interface Matrix of 105MM and 155MM Projectiles-	An update on the ARDEC MEMS Safe and Arm efforts -	Data from the D-Fuze 105mm testing that will be conducted in May 08-	155mm spin-stabilized artillery control authority report from ARL-	Draft contract report on the ArrowTech Incorporated PRODAS upgrade (Note: The Government has developed improved PRODAS capabilities through efforts with ArrowTech and will use these capabilities to evaluate potential prototype aerodynamic characteristics)-	GIF Anti-jam Performance Specification


Amendment 01 extended the closing date to 30 JUN 08.


Addition from Amendment 02 (Posted 12 JUN 08): The Government is considering alternative PGK-2 implementation strategies for operational and training use that include procuring much larger quantities peryear than currently planned and desires to get information from respondents on the rough order of magnitude unit costs for PGK-2 associated with possibleimplementation scenarios identified below: 
Scenario 1 - Quantity of 10-20k/yr all GPS SAASM with AJ capability 
Scenario 2a - Quantity of 50k/yr all GPS SAASM with AJ capability 
Scenario 2b - Quantity of 50k/yr with 50% that are GPS SAASM with AJ capabilityand 50% w/o GPS SAASM and AJ 
Scenario 3a - Quantity of 100k/yr all GPS SAASM with AJ capability 
Scenario 3b - Quantity of 100k/yr with 25% that are GPS SAASM with AJ capability and 75% w/o GPS SAASM and AJ 
Scenario 4a - Quantity of 150k/yr all GPS SAASM with AJ capability 
Scenario 4b - Quantity of 150k/yr with 20% that are GPS SAASM with AJ capability and 80% w/o GPS SAASM and AJ 
Contractors are advised that no funding will be provided for preparation of theROMS.


Addition from Amendment 03 (Posted 19 JUN 08): 
The Government is interested in respondents feedback on achieving an objectiveaccuracy requirement of the 95-100% of the all projectiles fired with  hour.If metrological data conditions are used for guidence, it should have a hit of less than 30-50 meters of the intended aim point.  If using GPS for guidance,respondents should provide their GPS accuracy assumptions along with theiraccuracy predictions.


This RFI, including all the additional information request via amendments, is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.  No award will be made as a result of this RFI.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this RFI. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this RFI. 
Interested sources should submit their qualification data and requested information not later than 10 JUL 08 to JM&L LCMC Acquisition Center, ATTN: Procurement POC Wilson Au (973-724-5388), Building 9, Picatinny, New Jersey 07806-5000 or email wilson.au@us.army.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR AN UPCOMING INDUSTRY DAY AND PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE.  The Jacksonville District Corps of Engineers will hold an Industry Day and Pre-Solicitation Conference, by telephone on Wednesday, July 9, 2008, at 1:00 p.m.  The toll free dial in number for this teleconference is:  (877) 807-5706 and the participant access code is 125239.  The total number of available incoming phone lines is limited; therefore, it is requested that each firm utilize a minimum number of lines (preferably only one or two) for those individuals participating.  In order to prepare, in advance, a list of attendees of individuals participating in this teleconference, it is requested that an e-mail be sent to Dolly.M.Colwell@usace.army.mil with the following information:  (1) name and address of your firm; (2) the total number of phone lines your firm will be using; (3) name and title of each individual participating; and (4) their telephone number and e-mail address.  Please include a statement in this e-mail indicating whether or not Jacksonville District may include this information when posting and/or distributing the list of attendees.<BR>  <BR>A DRAFT SOLICITATION (W912EP-08-Z-0005) WAS POSTED TO ASFI ON June 4, 2008.  The purpose of this Industry Day and Pre-Solicitation Conference is to discuss all aspects of the Draft Solicitation, to answer questions from industry concerning the project, and to partner with industry in order to successfully accomplish this project.  It is requested that all participants review the Draft Solicitation and submit any specific questions, comments, or concerns in writing via e-mail by close of business on Wednesday, July 2, 2008, to Dolly.M.Colwell@usace.army.mil. This will allow the technical and contracting team sufficient time to fully address these issues and prepare complete and accurate responses for presentation at the teleconference.  The conference will begin with the Jacksonville District personnel responding to these written questions, comments and concerns.  An open discussion period will follow and any additional issues may be presented at that time.  All issues will be discussed as fully as possible; however, any items requiring further study and/or research may result in answers not being readily available during the teleconference and responses may require deferment to a later date.<BR>

The contracts will consist of a base year and three one year option periods. The approximate value of the contracts is a combined total of $20,000,000.00. The evaluation factors that will be used to determine the successful awardees are as follows: Factor 1 - Mission Capability, Factor 2 - Past Performance, Factor 3 - Proposal Risk, and Factor 4 - Price/Cost. Mission Capability (Factor 1) and Past Performance (Factor 2) are of equal importance. Proposal Risk (Factor 3) is slightly less important than Factors 1 and 2. Cost/Price (Factor 4) is slightly less important than Factor 3. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), Factors 1, 2, and 3 when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price; however, cost/price will contribute substantially to the selection decision.</p>
