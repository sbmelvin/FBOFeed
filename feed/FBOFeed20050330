<SUBJECT>B--Investigations of Chemosynthetic Communities on the Lower Continental Slope of the Gulf of Mexico

<CONTACT>Debra M. Bridge Contract Specialist 7037871814     Debra.Bridge@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MMS), solicits CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS for the study entitled "INVESTIGATIONS OF CHEMOSYNTHETIC COMMUNITIES ON THE LOWER CONTINENTAL SLOPE OF THE GULF OF MEXICO".  The NAICS code is 541990. The MMS intends to competitively award a contract for a requirement under the auspices of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP).  NOPP is a collaboration of fifteen Federal agencies to provide leadership and coordination of national oceanographic research and education programs.  This solicitation directly addresses two of five elements of the NOPP Investment Strategy that represent emerging national ocean research needs and agency priorities Operational/Routine Observations and Outreach/Education).  Both Minerals Management Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Ocean Exploration Office will be collaborating agencies. INTRODUCTION: The vast majority of the bottom in deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) is comprised of soft sediments (mixtures of sand, silt, and clay), but two other major habitat types also occur; chemosynthetic communities and a variety of community types that can be associated with hard bottom in areas that may or may not also be associated with living chemosynthetic megafauna (most all hard bottom areas in the deep Gulf are created through biogenic precipitation of carbonate by chemosynthetic bacteria). Many MMS sponsored studies have been limited to the maximum depths of the most commonly available in situ observation research tools including the submersibles from Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, the Johnson Sea Link I and II, and the Navy's nuclear research submarine, NR1.  All three of these facilities are limited to approximately a 1,000 m working depth.  There is a great deal of evidence that chemosynthetic communities occur, and are probably common at depths below 1,000 m.  Several high-density chemosynthetic communities have been documented at depths below 2,000 m in the central GOM.  Remote sensing signatures, including space imagery and reflectivity of the sea floor from seismic surveys, indicate that there may be many more undiscovered high-density communities in deeper areas of the Gulf, particularly between 1,000 and 2,000 m in depth.  Differences in bottom sediment regimes, salt structure, water temperatures, and hydrate stability compared to the upper slope may radically alter the abundance and composition of lower slope communities.  In addition, deepwater hard bottom habitats not associated with chemosynthetic communities are also recognized for their value as unique fish habitat, high biodiversity and deepwater coral habitat.  The most significant deepwater coral species in the GOM, Lophelia has only been recorded from the upper slope depths, but there is no reason not to expect some coral growth, and even the presence of Lophelia at depths below 1,000 m.  Although Lophelia is most common world wide between 200-500 m, it has been reported as deep as 3,000 m.  One fundamental MMS mission is to identify and consider the protection of sensitive biological habitats in U.S. Federal waters. The oil and gas industry has, and will continue to move into deeper and deeper water in their continuing search for extractable energy reserves in the Gulf of Mexico.  Knowledge of the distribution, relative abundance, and population structures of deepwater organisms provides critical information to estimate the potential effects of deepwater exploration and production and allow refinement of mitigation measures for the deeper continental slope area. Little is presently known about the potential occurrence and distribution of lower slope chemosynthetic communities and their sensitivity to possible impacting activities related to energy production.  There may be significant differences between upper and lower slope chemosynthetic communities.   Even less is known about coral or other hard bottom fauna inhabiting limited hard substrate on the lower Gulf slope.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE: (1) to characterize known or newly discovered chemosynthetic communities at depths below 1,000 m in the central or western Gulf of Mexico. (2) to characterize all other hard bottom biological communities encountered regardless of associations with active hydrocarbon seep activity or living chemosynthetic community species in the central or western Gulf of Mexico, 3) to determine the comparative degree of sensitivity to anthropogenic impacts for both 1) and 2) above through a variety of approaches such as rarity, unique taxonomy/biodiversity, or other environmental risk assessment methodologies.  This objective includes development of understanding how these deep communities are similar or different from their shallower counterparts and 4) to further develop successful assessment methodologies for correlation of remote sensing information such as bathymetry, seabed acoustic reflectivity (anomalies), sub-bottom structure or other geophysical signatures obtained by non-visual techniques with the "potential" presence of non-soft bottom biological communities at depths below 1,000 m in the central or western Gulf of Mexico.  SCOPE OF WORK: This study consists of eight (8) main tasks: (1) selection of a Scientific Review Group; (2) refinement of hypotheses, field methodologies and logistics; (3) site selection; (4) field sampling; (5) sample and data analysis; (6) data interpretation, synthesis and reporting; (7) development of educational outreach materials; and (8) interaction with international marine life database organizations. The estimated cost of this study is between $2.8 and $3.0 million.  The performance period of this study is anticipated to be forty-eight (48) months. The field work is anticipated to occur during the summer of the second and third years with the remaining time dedicated to analyses, synthesis of results, and completion of all deliverables. The study area is the region of the northern Gulf of Mexico lower continental slope below a depth of 1,000 m.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Ocean Exploration (NOAA OE) is expected to provide, at no cost to the Offeror, up to 15 days of field time on the R/V Atlantis II including the DSRV Alvin submersible during 2006 and up to 15 days of field time including research vessel and other submergence facilities such as ROVs for the 2007 field year (not Alvin).

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to modify Contract No. 263-C-00-01-00028-01 under which Metcalf & Eddy, Inc. (M&E) provides Construction Management Consultant (CMC) services to the USAID Alexandria Wastewater System Expansion II Project. The modification will be made using the Other than Full and Open Competition procedures allowed under USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) Subpart 706.302-70 (b) 5 which states: “An award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or would result in unacceptable delays.”  There will be no solicitation documents issued for the proposed action. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The government will consider all expressions of interest received within forty five days (45) after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
 
 
M&E is providing CMC services for the current Host Country Contract (HCC) between the construction contractor, ABB Susa, Inc. and the Alexandria Company for Sanitary Drainage ((ACSD). The HCC, valued at $74,220,310 and LE 85,680,890 (Egyptian Pounds), includes the construction for the expansion of two major treatment plants and six pump stations. The HCC which started on May 18, 2000, is 99% complete and is scheduled to finish on August 31, 2005. M&E’s Contract expires on May, 31, 2005. The purpose of the contract modification is to extend the M&E Contract for a period of four months from May 31, 2005 to September 30, 2005, in order to allow for the continuation of CMC services through the end of the HCC and to closeout the HCC and CMC Contracts. The only remaining work in the HCC is the completion of punch list items for which the CMC will monitor with a small staff. The contract modification will add $250,000 to the current M&E Contract amount of $9,082,412.  

The place of CMC performance is in Alexandria, Egypt.

<DESC>US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has identified an urgent and compelling need for a functional, deployable system to support USSOCOM Joint Task Force efforts in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). The required system capability is a direct result of mission preparation, mission execution and interoperability gaps identified during Operations ENDURING FREEDOM, IRAQI FREEDOM and other ongoing classified USSOCOM missions.

Specifically, USSOCOM requests the rapid fielding of prototype WARRIOR REACH systems for operational assessment prior to follow-on procurement and operational fielding. (See attached USSOCOM SCSO J32-CC letter).

This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-2, "Unusual and Compelling Urgency."   

	a.  The WARRIOR REACH project is a joint initiative to integrate real-world intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities into USSOCOM mission preparation and operational architectures to improve current mission preparation, testing and operational capabilities. WARRIOR REACH directly supports USSOCOM’s GWOT Joint Task Force efforts by addressing mission preparation, execution, and interoperability gaps identified in Operations ENDURING FREEDOM AND IRAQI FREEDOM (OEF/OIF) lessons learned. It also facilitates and supports OSD’s Training Transformation Strategic and Implementation Plans and USJFCOM’s Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) training transformation initiative.  Specifically, the WARRIOR REACH project will provide a deployable, line-of-sight (LOS), web-based architecture (Version 1.0) that supports special operations forces/conventional forces (SOF/CF) mission preparation, testing and real-world operational requirements.  WARRIOR REACH V1.0 will provide an organic, deployable network capability wherein Live, Virtual, and Constructive information can be correlated and displayed in a web-based environment without the need for national collection assets, wideband communications, and/or traditional infrastructure. WARRIOR REACH V1.0 will allow all echelons of command to interactively collaborate for analysis, planning, training, testing and rehearsal. The WARRIOR REACH V1.0 architecture will be used to display a dynamic 2D/3D Common Operational Picture (COP) across command elements.  At the tactical echelons, Tactical Display Units (TDUs) and applications will allow filtered/refreshed information to display geographical knowledge of assets and threats in the deployed environment for effective coordination and execution of missions in training, rehearsal, testing and operational environments.

	b.  The provider must be fully knowledgeable of and privy to and have access to the current USSOCOM operational requirements.  The provider must possess the necessary TS/SCI security clearances.   Given the time constraints involved and importance for immediate development and delivery of the required prototype systems limits the number of potential offerors.

	c.  Schedule requirements dictate that the contractor be prepared to support and participate in operational assessments scheduled for SOPAC in May 2005 and SOCEUR in June 2005.  Preparation for the operational assessments will require initial integration and testing from April 2005 through May 2005.  These assessments are critical to definitizing the operational requirements and subsequent development and fielding of an operational WARRIOR REACH system.  Any delay in conduct of the assessments will result in a delay in the development and fielding of the WARRIOR REACH system and the operational gaps identified during current, ongoing USSOCOM missions will remain.  As such, US military force lives, equipment, and mission accomplishment continue to be at increased risk until the WARRIOR REACH system is fielded.

This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available.

<DESC>THIS IS THE SOLICITATION NOTICE.       RFP IS AVAILABLE.      SEE DETAILS BELOW.  NO HARDCOPIES WILL BE PROVIDED BY GSA, BUT CONTRACTORS CAN UPLOAD AN ELECTRONIC VERSION AND PRINT FROM THE UPLOAD.


The project is a continuation of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 188,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated award range is $20,000,000 to $30,000,000.  Completion time is 602 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about August 29, 2005.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) meeting the minimum requirement of having worked on a similar or partially similar project – defined as an interior office renovation or other renovation project with a comparable level of interior finishes (new construction projects will not be evaluated); (2) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (3) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 11 through 14; miscellaneous lobby work on floors 15, 16 and 18; and stair towers on floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction; however, floors 13 and 14 will be initially vacant.  The 12th floor tenant will vacate the floor and move to 14 after completion of 14th floor work, the 11th floor tenant will move to 13, the 10th floor tenant will move to 12 and the 9th floor tenant will move to 11.  Above ceiling work on the 10th floor generally related to 11th floor plumbing is also required.  Base Bid Work:  Generally consists of general demolition, and asbestos and lead paint abatement; reconfiguration of existing shaft openings; seismic bracing of shaft walls; complete renovation of lobbies and restrooms including reconfiguration of restrooms; wood paneling, terrazzo, drywall partitions, paint and plaster, new ceramic tile walls and floors; new ceilings, lighting and above ceiling HVAC throughout the floor; and new building signage/graphics.  Option Bid Work consists of:  tenant improvements; egress stair improvements; dedicated computer room chilled water system; sun control; power monitoring; utility monitoring on main utilities; sub-metering; LEED; and porcelain wall tile.  Phased substantial completion dates are required.

Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation, the price and, at the Government’s Option, an in-person interview.  For this solicitation, the goal is to select the proposal that offers the best combination of technical qualifications, price and an optional interview.  The Government intends to award the contract to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, with technical factors being considered more important than price. The object is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price. Proposals will be evaluated in three stages, however technical qualifications and price proposals shall be submitted at the same time, but evaluated separately.  The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on or about 03-30-05.  The RFP will consist of technical qualifications and a pricing proposal.  Stage One, the Technical Proposal, will establish those within a competitive range. The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel, (3) Management Plan, and (4) Sustainable Construction Materials and Methods.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  Stage Two shall consist of Pricing.  Offerors should submit price proposals that are acceptable without additional information, as the Government may make the final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability based solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with the award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The offeror with the highest technical rank and the lowest price will be considered the most advantageous.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  If the selection board deems it necessary or desirable, they may invite selected firms to an in-person interview, which shall constitute Stage Three.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications, price and the interview, if held, that is the most advantageous to the Government.  The Government will evaluate all proposals that meet the minimum requirements.  

The Request for Proposal (RFP) includes a general scope of work, completed Construction Documents, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction documents and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps (www.fedbizopps.gov) to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FedTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FedTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FedTeDS.  The drawings are being provided as .PDF files.  Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.  Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact, 
2.	Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.	Your Company’s Tax ID Number, 
4.	Your Telephone Number, and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.  

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FedTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FedTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeDs" and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official planholders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

Effective January 1, 2005, Representations and Certifications (required to be completed prior to proposal submission) must be completed online.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA), you will need to have two items:  an active CCR record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  You must complete the ORCA  PRIOR to date and time of receipt of proposals for this project to be considered responsive to this solicitation.  To complete the online version of the Representations and Certifications for your company, please see http://www.bpn.gov/ and select “Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) - Vendor.”

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on April 18, 2005, at 1:00 p.m., local time, in room N133 of the Richard Bolling Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.  Technical and Price Proposals will be received on Tuesday, May 10, 2005, at 2:00 p.m., local time.  Specific location is specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will evaluate submissions and the public will be notified of the successful offeror at the time of award.

Prior to award of contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.

The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  All responsible sources not limited by the restrictions stated in the first paragraph may submit an offer, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.

The RFP specification and Construction Documents are available ONLY by link via this announcement.  The list of planholders will be based only on those requesting the Proposal Documents via FedTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.

<DESC>The Geothermal Program Office (GPO) of the U.S. Navy is seeking an independent analysis of the hydrogeology of the area known as the Coso Hot Springs, located in the Coso Range, Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake, CA.  The Coso Geothermal Area has been the subject of both occasional and intensive study over the past 90 years, but no compelling hydrogeologic model has emerged that clearly explains the relationship between major surface thermal features and the deep geothermal resource that is being used to generate electricity in nearby power plants.  Specifically the study shall describe any influence on Coso Hot Springs from activities related to geothermal power production in the adjacent Coso Geothermal Field.  The work performed under this contract will attempt to provide a comprehensive model that: explains the occurrence and movement of subterranean waters; the mechanical, chemical, and thermal interaction of this water with the porous and permeable medium; and the transport of energy and chemical constituents related thereto.  As described in the edited list of relevant publications provided in this solicitation, there are numerous data sets available for the area including more than 20 years of monitoring reports, compiled and interpreted by personnel of the U.S. Navy Geothermal Program Office, its contractors, and independent scientific investigators.  These resources will be made available to the successful offeror to utilize in completing the work.  The study must address all aspects of the Coso Range hydrologic environment including the non-geothermal, high-desert hydrogeology, both shallow local and deep regional hydrology, as well as the geothermal elements of the overlying Coso geothermal field.  As appropriate, and required to, acknowledge the importance of the neotectonic setting in which the Coso Hot Springs is located, the proposal shall incorporate known structural and tectonic findings into the hydrogeology model.  This study must be completed in one year or less from date of contract award, and the required products will be: (1) A technical report fully documenting the detailed hydrogeologic model as well as all analyses, syntheses, assumptions and processes that contributed to the model.  (2) A less-technically oriented summary report that shall be written and illustrated such that the scientific processes, modeling and conclusions of the study can be readily understood by the general public.  PROPOSAL EVALUATION - A team of Navy technical experts in the geosciences will conduct the evaluations of all proposals, and make recommendations to the source selection authority for contract award.  - The criteria listed below will be the basis for proposal evaluation and selection.  Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposed work is substantially more important than the other criteria.  All other criteria are of equal importance.  Price will be a factor in determining contract award, but it will not be the sole criterion.  The Navy intends to award a contract to the proposal that offers the best value: Scientific and technical merit of the work proposed.  Demonstrated understanding of, and familiarity with, hydrothermal systems.  Capabilities and related experience of key personnel in the technical areas being proposed, foremost of which is hydrogeology; realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs.  All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to Deborah Green, Contract Specialist, deborah.green@navy.mil

<DESC>Subject to final approval, Financial Crime Enforcement Network, (FinCEN), through the Department of Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt, intends to issue on a sole-source basis, a simplified acquisition, for T1 service lines to Netifice Communications Inc., 4605 Brookfield Corp. Dr. 2nd Floor, Chantilly, VA 20151.  FinCEN has been using the Netifice (formerly Epoch) Internet Service Provider T1 line for 6 years.  FinCEN needs to triple the speed of the Netifice T1 line to provide more bandwidth for the new BSA Direct Project.  The Secure Outreach Project and BSA Direct project are on extremely critical schedules.  Changing Internet Service Providers would mean that FinCEN could no longer use the Netifice TCP/IP numbers that currently 2,000 Federal, State, and Local Law Enforcement Agents are using since Netifice is the only source of those unique numbers.  Changing the Internet Service Provider would be extremely disruptive to both projects.  The address range must remain 209.101.132.0 through 209.101.132.31.  The addresses within this block are non-portable.  FinCEN cannot have loss of service due to the switching of an ISP.  No solicitation document is available.  Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 2:00 p.m., EDT on April 6, 2005.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required item or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Request for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we will make a sole-source award to Netifice Communications Inc.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for one (1) high spectral resolution, imaging, ultrahigh vacuum x-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) system.  The XPS system will be a shared user instrument that services multiple NIST projects spanning at least three laboratories and six divisions.  The projects include molecular and organic electronics, chemical microsensors, microfluidics, combinatorial methods, and biomaterials.  Many of the materials to be analyzed are so called soft materials such as organic monolayers or multilayers, biological thin films of DNA or proteins, and polymer films.  Successful analysis of these fragile materials requires an XPS instrument with high sensitivity, high spectral resolution, and imaging or small spot capabilities.  High spectral resolution provides unambiguous chemical state information about these organic materials.  Because of the delicate nature of molecular and biological monolayers, a high sensitivity instrument is essential for rapidly obtaining high signal to noise spectra while limiting radiation damage.  In addition, several projects require small spot and imaging capabilities with lateral resolution of 3 to 10 micrometers to probe micromachined structures or lithographically patterned surfaces.  Because the instrument will be servicing many projects, NIST requires that the XPS system be able to load large or multiple samples (dimensions provided below) and contain a fully automated, computer controlled sample stage for unattended analysis of multiple or gradient samples.  In addition, to meet the sample analysis throughput demands, NIST requires that the system be supplied with an external microscope stage to allow pre-alignment of samples on a sample platen.   The instrument must also be capable of loading a sample nominally the size of a 4 inch diameter silicon wafer, a sample that will be used by many of the projects described above.  Finally, because valence band electronic structure is of critical importance to the projects of molecular and organic electronics, NIST requires an instrument equipped with an ultraviolet He discharge type source appropriate for ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).


NIST will supply Interested Parties with test materials in order to produce a sample which will be evaluated during the technical evaluation.  Test results of the aforementioned NIST test sample shall be evaluated and approved by NIST scientists.  Test results shall also be available after installation before the instrument is accepted by NIST. 

Installation and Training will also be required of the successful Contractor.  Maintenance support after expiration of warranty may be required as well.

***This equipment, which is classified as commercial equipment, will be competed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under Authority of FAR part 12 and subpart 13.5 Test Program.

***Delivery shall be required prior to September 30, 2005.

***FOB shall be DESTINATION, Gaithersburg, MD.

***The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible Parties may submit a quote.

***The competitive Solicitation, specifications, amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under Solicitation Number SB1341-05-Q-0459.

***The Solicitation is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about April 4, 2005 and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

***Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.   No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Erin.Schwam@NIST.Gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Paulette Wilson, (757) 878-2788
<DESC>This is a synopsis for a noncommercial program entitled MonoTiltrotor (MTR) Studies.  The primary purpose of the program is to further refinement of subsystem design and modeling and analysis of the MTR through the use of sub-scale platforms.  The MT R is a novel air platform with unique subsystems.  A more detailed refinement and understanding of this air platform is needed to substantiate the initial performance estimates purported by Baldwin Technology Company, LLC and determine the applicability of  the MTR to mission requirement.  AATD anticipates award of an  Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Baldwin Technology Company, LLC, who is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement. The ma ximum value of the contract will be $5 million.  The contract minimum value of $850,000 will be met with award of the first task order issued as a firm-fixed-price order.  The funding for this requirement is Congressionally directed to investigate MTR.  Ac cordingly, this acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(l) and FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as market research has identified only Baldwin Technology Company, LLC as having developed and patented a concept for this  nontraditional VTOL air platform.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Baldwin Technology Company, LLC.  The contract terms and requirem ents will be developed jointly between the Government and Baldwin Technology Company, LLC, consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).  The MTR is envisioned as a large scale air platform with a tilting coaxial rotor system and a unique payload handling system which consists of two support struts which secure the load beneath the rotating rotor/propeller.  The aircraft is expected to operate as a Hovering Helicopter to lift and drop its load, an d as a fixed wing aircraft in transport mode.  It gains its proposed efficiency by tilting its coaxial rotor forward into a fixed wing propeller configuration.  The MTR flies like a fixed wing airplane by aerodynamically deploying the FreeWing flight struc ture.  This structure acts as a set of wings and tail in forward flight.  Baldwin Technology Company, LLC is the original designer and developer of the MTR, and is deemed the only firm holding the US patent for the MTR.  The overall period of performance f or the IDIQ contract is sixty (60) months.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NIACS) code is 541710 and the size standard is 1,500.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a pro posal that shall be considered.  Written proposals should be addressed to AATD, Attn: AMSRD-AMR-AA-C (Paulette L. Wilson), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.  Ms. Wilsons phone number is 757-878-2788.  Anyone desiring an explanation o r interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing at the above address (Datafax 757-878-0008) or pwilson@aatd.eustis.army.mil.  Contracting Officer is Lauren L. Sebring and can be reached at 757-878-4828 or lsebring@aatd.eustis.army.mil.  No tes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>--AMENDED--This is a synopsis for services to be procured under FAR Part 15. The 45th Contracting Squdron (45 CONS) intends to negotiate an extension to contract F08650-98-C-0035 on a sole source basis with Sverdrup Technologies Inc, Cage Code 07486, to ensure continuation of launch operations and support services. A cost-plus-award-fee extension, with cost-plus-fixed-fee O&M CLINs, is contemplated for a basic 2-month period (1 May - 30 Jun 05) and for two 3-month option periods, if required (1 Jul 05 - 31 Dec 05). This contract extension will be a temporary bridge to provide continuous support of present requirements to prevent impairment of processing and launch capabilites. The options will be subject to termination for any remaining portion by the contracting officer if the follow-on acquisition is completed prior to period end. This sole source acquisition is justified under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Sverdrup is currently performing services under this contract. It would not be practical or possible for two contractors to perform these services at one time. Technical analysis of the time required to learn and become proficient in performing the in-depth services would require an extended phase-in period that would lead to a substantial duplication of costs that would not be warranted given the possibly short duration of the anticipated extension. Other than the incumbent contractor, no firms currently possess the requisite experience, knowledge, and on-station capability to perform these functions. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The present contract is scheduled to be replaced by the LOSC F08650-03-R-0010 on 1 Jul 05. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 561210. The 45 CONS has determined that Sverdrup is the only source capable of providing the necessary services. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Sources who feel they are capable of performing this effort in its entirety should provide evidence of capability prior to the closing date of this announcement.

Services include, but are not limited to design and engineering services for various electrical projects with associated multi-discipline architect-engineering support services.  The services may include but not limited to engineering studies; preparation of plans, specification, cost estimates, and parametric cost estimates; as built drawings; and post construction services.  Projects may involve new construction, alteration, repair, and installation of electrical facilities and systems.  If asbestos or hazardous materials exist, the Architect-Engineer (A-E) contractor shall identify and provide for their disposal in the required documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous materials.  The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days of the meeting.  The contract will be of the Indefinite Quantity type where the work will be required on an as needed basis during the life of the contract providing the government and contractor agree on the amount.  Each project contract will be a firm fixed price A-E Contract.  The Government will determine the delivery order amount by using rates negotiated and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.  The contract term will be a base year and two one-year option years. The Government reserves the option to extend the contract for an additional two years.  The annual fee for any year may not exceed $2,000,000 and per project limitation is $1,200,000.  The total fee for the contract term shall not exceed $5,000,000. In the event the maximum annual not-to-exceed amounts are not met, the Government reserves the right to carry-over any unused capacity to the following year(s) but shall not exceed $2,000,000 per year.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $10,000.  There will be no future synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised.  Estimated construction cost of project is between less than $5,000 and $5,000,000.  Estimated date of contract award is June 2005.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  The following selection evaluation criteria, in order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: (1) Professional qualifications of firm and staff proposed for the design for electrical exterior primary distribution, substations, power generation, secondary distribution, and telecommunications systems and facilities in the Hawaii, Guam, and Pacific Ocean areas; (2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members in the design for electrical exterior primary distribution, substations, power generation, secondary distribution, and telecommunications systems and facilities in the Hawaii, Guam, and Pacific Ocean areas; (3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; (5) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure problems through an integrated design approach; (6) A-Es quality control program experience; (7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; (8) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  For this selection criteria, the government will evaluate proposals based on two Sub-factors:  (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project; (9) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts. Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper. For selection criteria (3) the government will also evaluate each firms past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.  For selection criteria (8), the Government will evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB, (2) Information on national awards received within the past three years for outstanding support to SB concerns, (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans, (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA Programs, (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javis Wagner O Day Program and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 3 years.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contract per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 05 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 74.8% to SB, 15.7% to SDB, 14% to WOSB, 3.1% to HUBZone SB and 3% to SDVOSB.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov<http://www.ccr.gov>.

<DESC>As a followup on work already completed by the Aerospace Corporation, the National Environmental Satellite Data Information Service (NOAA/NESDIS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Aerospace Corporation for the Aeronautical Space Systems Engineering, C-3, Acquisition Support, and Operational Convergence R&D program.  The incumbent contractor maintains the unique competency and diverse expertise through its long-term design support and engineering review of civilian and military meteorological satellite platforms. This program will require approximately 60 staff per year, beginning February 1, 2006.  NOAA/NESDIS intends to award a contract having a base period plus four (4) 1-year options. The NOAA/NESDIS manages NOAA’s operational geo-stationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellite programs.  The NOAA/NESDIS objective is to provide the spacecraft, launch services, and ground systems necessary to maintain the uninterrupted flow of remotely-sensed environmental data required to promote, protect, and enhance the Nation’s economy, security, environment, and quality of life.  The Contractor's role in the NOAA/NESDIS Organization is as an independent, objective, non-competitive Corporation whose mission under this contract is to support the program acquisition objectives of the NOAA/NESDIS and related NOAA programs. The Contractor will provide non-advocacy assessments of program implementation, design approach, advanced pre-development planning, developmental and operational risks, integration and test data analysis, launch readiness assessment, on-orbit performance assessment, ongoing analyses of associated technologies, and support to failure analysis inquiries. The Contractor will also provide technical assistance and advice in the preparation and resulting evaluation of complex technical specifications. Parties who desire consideration for this requirement must fully identify their capabilities, in writing, to the Contract Specialist as identified in  this announcement within 45 calendar days of the posted date of this presolicitation notice.
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY THIS NOTICE IS HEREBY CANCELLED. A CORRECTION ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE FORTHCOMING IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of this synopsis. Salient characteristics: The U.S. Geological Survey has an on-going requirement for implementing the Memorandum of Understanding executed in 1991 between the University of Memphis and the U.S. Geological Survey for earthquake research and hazard mitigation. USGS scientists and scientists at the University of Memphis work in conjunction at the University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI). The CERI has a longstanding research program concerning the earthquake hazards in that seismically active part of the United States. Requirement is for office space on-site at the University of Memphis, as well as a graduate research assistant, some office support, computer network access with CERI, and other miscellaneous services, including mail and copying services and a dedicated fax line. The space needs to be located on-site in order to perform collaborative research and collaborative outreach activities, conduct co-operative seismological studies, interpret seismic data, records and documentation archived at the University, and to be able to attend meetings and conferences held on campus, often with no prior notice. Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the item specified as a sole source from the University of Memphis Center for Earthquake Research and Information, Memphis, Tennessee, 38152, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required item, or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein), are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. See Note 22.

<DESC>LITIGATION CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
Purpose
This is a Sources Sought announcement for a planned upcoming DOJ solicitation to acquire the Litigation Case Management System (LCMS) described below.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Specifically, this RFI is seeking submission of descriptions of IT product/solution and consulting services that provide functionality needed by DOJ to support common litigation case management business needs in the 94 U.S. Attorneys Offices and the six other major DOJ litigating divisions, and share information across organizational boundaries.  The emphasis of this RFI is to identify a wide range of possibilities that would support the initial phase of the LCMS functional requirements.

Background

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is in the process of developing an enterprise architecture for the Department using a common solutions approach.  Common solutions are business solutions that support two or more organizations, and help the Department achieve interoperable systems that exploit economies of scale.  Case Management has been identified as an area of opportunity for common solutions within DOJ and across the federal government. 

Under the guidance of the OMB’s Lines of Business (LoB) Program to develop business-driven, common solutions across agencies, DOJ leads the Case Management Common Solutions Program.  LoB solutions address distinct business improvements to enhance the government's performance and services for citizens.  The objective of all LoB efforts is to save taxpayer dollars, reduce administrative burden, and significantly improve service delivery to citizens.  

The Case Management Common Solutions Program Vision:  Using common solutions and data standards, case management information is easily and appropriately shared within and across federal and other government agencies, and with citizens.  Through the Case Management Common Solutions Program, DOJ seeks to develop and implement an enterprise architecture for sharing case-related information within and between DOJ components, partner agencies, and the public. The architecture will effectively capture information once, and make it available to all authorized users.  

The current litigation case management environment at DOJ does not support efficient, automated information sharing or streamlined reporting abilities.  Far from acting like a unified law firm in support of a central mission, Justice litigation divisions (or “components”) are highly decentralized, and information is stored in numerous disconnected systems.  For example, when a case is turned over from a litigating division to a U.S. Attorney’s Office (USAO), copies of the paper case files are made and are sent via mail or courier.  As case information is received from the division, the USAO creates their own independent case file, and re-enters case data into their own case management system.  Once the USAO takes the lead on the case, the originating division no longer has the ability to monitor case status or view updated case information in their own system(s).

Litigation Case Management System

This announcement is focused on litigation case management, in particular the Litigation Case Management System (LCMS).  LCMS is the first specific investment to emerge from the Case Management Common Solutions Program.

Litigation case management systems serve three levels of business needs:  
·	At the legal professional level, case management systems allow legal professionals to track and manage information about, and in support of individual cases.  
·	At the supervisory level, case management systems allow supervisors to track and report performance, and balance case workload across their organization.  
·	At the executive level, case management systems provide organizational performance data to support executive level decision-making, including recognizing trends and allocating resources in support of mission and strategic goals.

The initial set of LCMS functionality falls primarily within the supervisory and executive levels of the three levels of case management needs described above. Litigation support tools, used by attorneys to organize and manage individual cases, as well as new document and records management functionality, are not part of the initial scope.  Phase 1 of LCMS is expected to include general functional capabilities such as case information management and reporting, caseload and performance reporting, and attorney time reporting.  Specific Litigation Case Management Services are described in the next section.

The LCMS program will use a phased, incremental approach to transition over time to the target architecture consisting of a suite of configurable and extensible IT solutions built upon a common foundation. LCMS will be required to provide an interface or integration with certain current applications and databases for other functionality.  Examples of such functions are: debt collection, records, and document management, electronic case filing, and other capabilities to be determined.  

The primary customers for this investment are the seven DOJ litigating component organizations: the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (representing the 94 US Attorneys’ Offices), the Antitrust Division, the Criminal Division, the Civil Division, the Civil Rights Division, the Environment and Natural Resources Division, and the Tax Division.


Litigation Case Management Services
The essential IT services currently planned for inclusion in LCMS Phase 1 include the following:

·	Forms Management- These services facilitate the creation, modification and usage of electronic forms used to capture case-related information in a structured format. These services, limited to case management support needs, assist with the management of electronic forms containing blank fields that users can fill in with data. An important aspect of automated data exchanges, the use of electronic forms allows case-related information to be captured in a standard format for database entry. 

·	Reports Generation - Many kinds of reports need to be generated from a case file, including periodic case status reports, which can be shared with supervisors, managers, and clients. Reports generation services support the organization of data into useful information. Reports need to be generated using either a pre-defined format or a user-defined (ad hoc) format. Reports generation tools should provide an intuitive user-interface and a capability to access a variety of data sources.  Reports generation also supports multiple output formats, as well as the conversion of data into graphical form, to include presentation of information in the form of diagrams, tables, charts and graphs.

·	Search and Query – These services include ad hoc searches, to allow users to browse through the internal database of case files to find all the records entered by a certain attorney, or cases that were decided in a particular jurisdiction, or records that contain a particular term. Database search functionality also allows the retrieval of case-related information within the bounds of user-selected parameters such as a subject category, date range, etc. Also included is the ability to search against information within and across cases searching on multiple keys.

·	Security and Privacy - This group of LCM support services defines capabilities needed to support effective measures to protect and safeguard information and systems from inappropriate or unauthorized use, alteration, loss, or destruction. Safeguards must also be implemented to assure that case management data is collected, stored, and managed in ways that assure the continuous protection of personal information within the constraints of the Privacy Act and other applicable policy.  Reliable and secure communications links must also offer adequate protection against unauthorized access to case information and case files. Two types of IT services are included in this group: 

a.	Security Management and Monitoring – These services are used to ensure continuous observation of security rules and regulations; ensure appropriate level of protection for case related information and data; ensure data is protected against unauthorized modification, use, destruction, or disclosure; and assure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

b.	Privacy Assurance – These services assure adherence to rules and regulations concerning the safeguarding of sensitive information covered by the Privacy Act and other applicable policy.

·	Case File Data Management – Case File data management services determine what data elements should be captured and how data should be used and stored.  These services facilitate the storage, processing, exchange, and general administration of case-related data in the case file. The case file is utilized to provide management oversight to litigation or administrative activity, e.g. management of case-related resources, assignments, authorizations and status changes, including metrics and accomplishments.  The case metadata includes the access controls applied to the case, the individual or organizational unit assigned primary ownership of the case, the individuals’ or organizational unit’s assigned co-ownership of the case, the organizational unit directly managing the case, and the case classification under which the case file is categorized. The service will maintain the history of all case metadata. Data access controls are based on statutory and other component-specific policy constraints. 

·	Automated Data Exchanges - Support for automated data exchanges between case management activities is needed to facilitate the timely exchange of case related information with other entities. During Phase 1, this service will support the exchange of case information with DOJ’s litigating divisions.  Long-term, this service will be expanded to include information exchanges with investigative and other partner agencies such as the IRS, the EPA, and the U.S Courts. 

·	Data Aggregation/Synthesis - Data aggregation and synthesis support services address the need to reconcile data from various sources to “normalize” the perspective of summary views or reports. These services support the aggregation of data collected from multiple sources or at different time intervals, typically to support roll-up reporting needs at the Component or Department level.  Information can be summarized in a manner that reconciles inconsistent data points to create a synthesized view of aggregated data that accurately projects an enterprise view of the current status as well as performance progress. By making data aggregation and synthesis services part of the LCM solution, better decision-support services can be provided. Managers will still have access to details behind the aggregated results, for verification and validation purposes. Synthesized views of case information will be based upon unified business rules that can eliminate the “double counting” of reported cases and also help to reconcile conflicting reports that result from local variations in business rule applications. 

·	Client Management - This group of LCM services considers the need for IT services to support the management of day-to-day client relationships.  Clients include partner agencies of DOJ litigation components such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Clients also include federal investigative agencies (such as ATF, DEA, FBI, and certain divisions of DHS). Victims of crime are also treated as LCM clients, for witness notification and/or witness protection purposes. These are the types of IT services included in this group:

a.	Client Relationship Management - These services provide capabilities needed to plan, schedule and control interaction between a client and DOJ attorneys both before and after a service is provided. DOJ must maintain contact information with the customer points of contact starting with basic information such as addresses, telephone numbers, and e-mail addresses.

b.   Calendaring and Event Scheduling – These services include the need to maintain a calendar and to schedule entries for upcoming court appearances, filing deadlines, meetings, and hearings.  

c.   Alerts and Notifications - These services relate to capabilities needed to allow someone to be contacted in response to ad hoc matters or events of interest. For example, when hearings and docket-driven events are about to occur, notifications can be sent to alert various external points-of-contact as well as internal members of a litigation team. 

·	Performance Measurement - These services are concerned with the development, refinement, and usage of performance metrics. These services support the planning, scheduling, capturing, and validation of metrics used for measuring performance effectiveness, in the context of Component’s mission goals and objectives. 

·	Business Rules Management - Business rules are reflected in locally determined practices or procedures that govern the way business activities are routinely performed. For example, the business rule governing the closing of a case file in one litigating component might be “when the courts have rendered a final judgment”; in another component, the same rule may be “when all residual activities (such as debt collection) have been completed.”  Business rules management services are applied at both the Department and Component levels to normalize enterprise reporting on the performance of business activities across organizations, and to allow for controlled flexibility in local applications of common business rules. These services support the ongoing refinement and consistent application of case management business rules by automating the process of maintaining records of the applicable rules, which can be changed by (authorized) users when circumstances require modifications to be made to existing business rules.

·	Resource & Assets Management - This group of LCM services covers the collection of capabilities needed to support the management of resources and assets. The following types of services are encompassed by this group: 

a.   Workforce Management - These services are used by supervisors and managers faced with the challenge of supplying scarce resources to satisfy a fluctuating demand for those resources. These services support the planning and supervision of a Component’s personnel, with an emphasis on the allocation of resources to satisfy constant changes in caseload demands. Tools are needed to assist with the monitoring and assessment of current caseloads as well as the projections of future caseloads. 

b.   Conflicts Checking - Automated support is needed to enable managers to access knowledge management support for conflicts checking, which provides powerful search capability for probing case information stored in the case-file database, to detect potential conflicts of interests with respect to intended case–related work assignments.

c.   Time Reporting - These services support the preparation, submission, approval and adjustment of hours worked by a Government employee and tracking that time to specific case, matters, or programs. To ensure continued reliability of online time reporting processes, tools are needed to enable the efficient tracking and reporting employee work hours.
Key Considerations
Key considerations that will influence the LCMS Phase 1 acquisition include the following:

Scalability and Flexibility: The solution must be scaleable and tailorable across a broad spectrum of organizational structures, geographically dispersed locations, and diverse organizational requirements.  DOJ is an organization with over 10,000 users in multiple litigating divisions, and 94 U.S. Attorneys’ offices located across the 50 United States and Territories. 

Non-exclusivity: The solution must preserve benefits of competition. Furthermore, since virtually all organizations will need to apply an incremental deployment strategy to successfully transition their environments, robust interoperability capabilities designed for open systems and industry standard platforms are required.  

Interfaces: The solution must interface with e-government initiatives and program support systems including, but not limited to document management, records management, and debt collection.

Section 508 Requirements: All electronic and information technology procured must meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194, unless an agency exception to this requirement exists.  36 CFR 1194 implements Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and is viewable at http://www.accessboard.gov/sec508/508standards.htm. 

Security: The solution must comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA).

Sharing of Information: Consistent with recent Executive Orders, the solution shall be extensible to support common standards for information sharing, such as the Global Justice XML Data Model and the National Information Exchange Model.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Low Energy Electron Microscope Imaging Energy Analyzer
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-CFN95230
<RESPDATE>041405

<DESC>In an effort to promote full and open competition Brookhaven Science Associates, operator of Brookhaven National Laboratory, is seeking sources for an Imaging Energy Analyzer for use with an ELMITEC Low Energy Electron Microscope (LEEM) III.

Imaging Energy Analyzer for LEEM III Microscope:

A complete and fully functional 180 degree deflecting imaging energy analyzer, fully compatible with the ELMITEC LEEM III microscope, consisting of:

- a combined retarding and imaging lens system at the entrance,
- a hemispherical analyzer,
- a combined accelerating and imaging lens system at the exit,
- adjustable slit(s) for energy selected imaging,
- all electronics, cables, mounting hardware, etc. required to operate the analyzer to its specifications (as stated elsewhere),
- installation on the existing LEEM III microscope, comprehensive operator training, and successful demonstration of all stated specifications.

To ensure compatibility with the LEEM III microscope, the retarding and accelerating lenses are required to change the beam energy between 20 keV in the LEEM III electron optics to the analyzer pass energy of approximately 1.8 keV.

The analyzer must be operable in three modes: in imaging mode (to obtain energy filtered images), in energy dispersive mode (to acquire, in a parallel fashion, photoelectron spectra averaged over small sample areas), and in photoelectron diffraction mode (to observe the LEED pattern or photoelectron angular distribution).

When mounted on the LEEM III system, the analyzer has to match the LEEM III electron optics as follows:

-	In imaging mode: LEEM III intermediate lens and projector lens 1 transfer the image and the objective lens back focal plane into two entrance planes (EP1, EP2) of the analyzer. The analyzer images EP2 into the energy-dispersive plane, and EP1 with magnification 1 into an image plane behind the dispersive plane. With a suitable slit in place in the analyzer’s dispersive plane, this double imaging, results in energy-filtered images, if the LEEM III projector lenses are excited to image the image plane onto the screen. The imaging kinetic energy is changed by changing the sample potential, and the only correction necessary is a slight change of objective lens focus, with no adjustments at the analyzer required.
-	In dispersive mode: with the slit fully open, the dispersive plane is imaged on the screen, and photoelectron energy spectra are obtained.
-	In photoelectron diffraction mode: when the focal plane is imaged onto the screen, photoelectron emission angular distribution patterns can be observed. In this mode, the sample surface is imaged into the dispersive plane of the analyzer, and the back-focal plane into its image plane.
The Imaging Energy Analyzer must be fully compatible with the ELMITEC LEEM III and meet or exceed the following minimum requirements:

Spectroscopic imaging mode 
1)	spatial resolution: <25nm 
2)	energy resolution: <0.5eV 
3)	isochromatism: <0.7eV/10µm 

Directly imaging of energy dispersion 
1)	energy resolution: <1eV 
2)	directly imaged energy range: >10eV 
3)	deviation from linearity: <5%

<SUBJECT>99 -- Free-Forming Objects with Low-Binder Slurry
<DESC>Free-Forming Objects with Low-Binder Slurry
US Patent 6,027,326
Technology Transfer Opportunity

Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, New Mexico) has developed a patented process for fabricating products from fine powders.  The process can be used to rapidly produce prototypes or manufacture parts in large quantities. 

A slurry of the material containing between 0.5 and 10 percent binder is deposited on a substrate to fabricate parts directly from fine particle powders without the use of molds.  The solid freeform fabrication technique for fine particles uses computer controlled layer-wise extrusion of colloidal slurries.  Particle sizes are typically 0.5 to 5 µm, and the slurry solids content ranges between 50 and 60 volume percent solids, depending on the particle size distribution and morphology.  The liquid carrier is usually water. The rheology of the slurry mixture is modified with minor additions of dispersants and organic binders to form pastes with a plastic consistency suitable for extrusion.  Orifice sizes range between 200 and 2000 µm, and parts may be built at rates on the order of 1 cm3 per minute.  Materials demonstrated include Al2O3, ZrO2, Si3N4, lead zirconate titanate (PZT), W, and Ag.  Since the process is essentially binderless (less than 1% organics) parts can be dried, and completely sintered into dense, strong parts in less than 24 hours.

Sandia is making this technology available to companies interested in partnering with Sandia to develop near term and/or future applications via licensing, including up to exclusive field of use licenses, or cooperative development agreements.  For further information, please respond by email or fax to Colleen Kearney within 15 days of this announcement at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0114, P. O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-0114. cakearn@sandia.gov or Fax:  (505) 844-8011.  Please indicate the date, number and title of this FBO notice and the specific interest your company has developing and commercializing this technology.

End date for all inquiries is April 15, 2005

<SUBJECT>59 -- GDP Model 225W and 225WB Format Synchronizers
<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and issue a modification to an existing contract with GDP Space Systems, Inc., Horsham, Pennsylvania, for additional units of the Model 225W and 225WB Format Synchronizers. These additional units will provide consistency and compatibility as well as maintenance and spare parts on the existing units.

The difference in the Model 225W and the Model 225WB Frame Synchronizer is that the Model 225WB can be used as a stand-alone Weather Format Synchronizer (WFS). The primary function of both models is ingesting and synchronizing to data from the TIROS-N Weather Satellites.  The units synchronize to the data streams and detect a predefined valid frame synchronizer pattern in the presence of bit-errors based on a flexible programmable synchronization strategy.  Telemetry data is then decommutated and extracted from the data stream and transmitted along with measured data quality information to other system equipment through the Ethernet LAN interfaces.  The unit is capable of sending and receiving the frame synchronized data via the respective input and output Ethernet ports.  The Ethernet input/output message format is defined and agreed to by NOAA.  The unit is housed in a rack mountable chassis and can be controlled locally from the front panel keyboard and menu driven display, or remotely from the host computer over the Command/Quality LAN Unicast channel. The unit also includes a built in simulator function that simulates all of the weather input formats supported by the unit.  This function accommodates both loopback test and simulator output test and acts as a telemetry data recorder of the input signal.  The unit can perform a verification of the simulator data as a self-test feature.

Both GDP Frame Synchronizers support the data formats of both the ATN and the KLM spacecraft.  These formats include HRPT (High Resolution Picture Transmission), LAC (Local Area Coverage), GAC (Global Area Coverage), AIP (AMSU Information Processor), SAIP (Stored AIP), TIP (TIROS Information Processor), TIP Boost  (TIROS Information Processor-Boost), and STIP (Stored TIP) data formats.  Aboard the spacecraft the TIP, HRPT, and/or the AIP data is transmitted in real-time, while the LAC, GAC, SAIP, and/or STIP data are played back from digital tape recorders in reverse direction.  The models will accept all formats and synchronize to them in both the forward and the reverse direction and perform polarity resolution (APC –Automatic Polarity Control) to correct for inverted data.  Specific synchronization strategies can be programmed into the box.  The data will then be individually processed depending on the format.  Each of these supported formats are processed by the format synchronizer and routed to the specified output ports.

These additional units will be delivered to NOAA facilities in Suitland, Maryland, Wallops, Virginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska. This is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity acquisition. Operational GDP units, matching the configuration of the proposed additional frame synchronizers, already exist in these NOAA facility locations. The additional units are being acquired with these objectives: (1) to extend the capability to an additional NOAA location at Port Barrow, Alaska, which is unattended; (2) to expand the capability of the NOAA Stations to handle multiple data streams from two satellites simultaneously; and (3) to provide spare developmental units to add flexibility to support operational development systems. Additional support services shall be provided for equipment upgrade modifications and to extend warranty services for up to 3 years. This modification will increase the maximum for these additional units from $1,609,856.00 by $500,000.00 to $2,109,856.00. The total maximum increase shall not exceed $500,000.00. It is the Government’s intent to compete any additional units in the future. Responses to this notice shall be submitted no later than c.o.b. April 15, 2005. Interested offerors can review the technical description for the GDP Model 225W at the following web site: http://www.gdpspace.com/products/225W.htm. 

No solicitation will be released for this requirement. If an interested offeror believes it can offer a brand name or equal item based on Government requirements, it shall respond within the specified date, to the agency contact point, describing how it can satisfy the Government’s needs without causing unacceptable delays, duplicating costs, or failure to meet technical objectives. Interested sources shall submit a written narrative of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature, demonstrating the ability to provide the required services in sufficient detail to permit an agency analysis to determine a bona-fide capability to meet the Government's requirements, within 15 days of the publication of this notice or by c.o.b. April 15, 2005.  Responses without the required documentation shall be considered non-responsive.  No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of this notice or the Government’s use of any information provided. The Government will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments. Responses must be submitted in writing (two copies) and must include all information cited herein. Submission shall be mailed to: U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA, NESDIS Acquisition Management Division, SSMC3 – Room 10100/OFA64, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 Attention: E.

<SUBJECT>A -- Ancillary studies to evaluate pathogenesis, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, imaging studies and determinates of progression and severity of NASH, NAFLD or crytogenic cirrhosis.
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:<P>
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks collaborators for Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to (1) evaluate a panel of serological assays that reflect hepatic fibrosis, inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress to differentiate among NAFLD, NASH, or cryptogenic cirrhosis, (2) identify protein alterations in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or cryptogenic cirrhosis, (3) evaluate noninvasive imaging methods for assessing fat, inflammation, disease activity and/or fibrosis in NASH including but not limited to the use of elastrography, nuclear magnetic resonance, molecular imaging, and (4) provide S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) to perform a randomized controlled trial of therapy of NASH and/or cryptogenic cirrhosis. <P>

The NAFLD Database study - A prospective database of adult and pediatric cases of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or cryptogenic cirrhosis was created by the NIDDK-funded NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN), which is currently accruing patients, and ultimately allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of approximately 1,500 patients for 3 years on average. <P>

In addition to the NAFLD Database study, the NASH CRN has developed two treatment trials: (1) PIVENS - to evaluate whether 96 weeks of treatment with either pioglitazone or vitamin E lowers NASH activity as determined from hepatic histology in nondiabetic adults with NASH compared to treatment with placebo, (2) TONIC - to determine whether 96 weeks of treatment with either metformin or vitamin E leads to sustained reduction in serum alanine transferase in nondiabetic children with NAFLD compared to treatment with placebo.  PIVENS is currently recruiting patients and TONIC will begin recruitment by June, 2005. <P>

Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, imaging studies, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease present a variety of opportunities for CRADAs. <P>

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to provide s-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) to perform a randomized controlled trial of therapy of cryptogenic cirrhosis.  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a CRADA to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, imaging studies, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and/or NASH.  Pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Public Health Service (PHS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company for ancillary studies.  Examples of potential studies include:  (1) Exploration of serum markers for fibrosis and serum markers for disease activity to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical, laboratory, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic variables in the NAFLD Database study.  (2) Exploration of the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in adult (PIVENS) and pediatric (TONIC) treatment trials.  (3) Evaluation of the role of lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of NASH or NAFLD and analysis of the effect of various therapies on the levels of serum peroxides in patients with NASH or NAFLD participating in treatment trials.  (4) Develop serum/plasma proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic expression arrays that are diagnostic of fatty liver disease or NASH or cryptogenic cirrhosis and that would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, steatosis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.  (5) Use of cytokine assays for analyses of serum/plasma cytokine levels as markers of necro-inflammatory or fibrotic activity in NAFLD or NASH and as surrogate markers of histologic improvement in therapeutic trials of NAFLD or NASH.  (6) Evaluation of the role of noninvasive imaging methods for assessing fat, inflammation, disease activity and/or fibrosis in NASH.  (7) Investigation of S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) as an antioxidant and therapeutic agent for NASH and/or cryptogenic cirrhosis. <P>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories.  It is not a grant, and is not a contract for the procurement of goods/services.  The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a CRADA collaborator.  Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort.  The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration.  The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and may make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA. <P>

STUDY GOAL:  The overall goal of the NASH Clinical Research Network is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with NAFLD or NASH using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of NAFLD or NASH and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by the NAFLD Database on adult and pediatric patients with NAFLD or cryptogenic cirrhosis including clinical information as well as serum, plasma, liver tissue, and DNA samples.  A description of laboratory tests that are needed including assays and required amount of specimens, to determine specific biomarker levels along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data. <P>

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  The Steering Committee will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Steering Committee through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages and should address the following selection criteria:  (1) The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized in the investigation of pioglitazone or metformin or vitamin E in patients with NAFLD or NASH and clearly describe important issues surrounding the evaluation of disease progression in these patients.  (2) The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the laboratory test agents in a timely manner for the duration of the study.  (3) The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment and evaluation of NAFLD or NASH or cryptogenic cirrhosis, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, from which offers are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued. This announcement is a Request for Proposal (RFP), solicitation #AB133R-05-RP-1115 and incorporates provisions, clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 2001-27 dated 12/28/04. The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price type contract, with a Base Year and four (4) One-Year Options.  This acquisition is full and open competition with a NAICS code of 541710.  It will be awarded under simplified acquisition procedures (Part 13).
BASE YEAR SERVICES STATEMENT OF WORK
1.0  OVERVIEW:  NOAA’s, National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS)  Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) and Northwest Regional office (NWR), are the Government agencies responsible for monitoring and managing west coast fisheries.
This contract is in support of the current at-sea monitoring program administered by the Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring Division (FRAMD), responsible for monitoring groundfish fishing off the west coast and specifically addresses a component being developed: an Electronic Monitoring System (EMS).  This electronic technology is designed to collect specific types of at-sea fisheries data more cost effectively than utilizing sea going biologists.
This statement of work describes an electronic monitoring project to be designed for and deployed on the commercial hake trawl fishery operating off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and northern California.  The overall goal of this project is to collect at-sea data to aid in monitoring groundfish bycatch by west coast fisheries.  An Electronic Monitoring System (EMS) can support at-sea bycatch coverage on the west coast by collecting vessel information from digital closed circuit television (CCTV) imagery of fishing operations, data from global positioning systems (GPS), and data from other on-board sensors.  The data will be analyzed and presented to NOAA Fisheries for incorporation into the groundfish management process.  This data will be used to verify total catch, areas fished and document any discard events that may take place.
1.1  SHORE-BASED HAKE FISHERY:  Shore-based hake is a mid-water trawl fishery in which 100% retention of all catch is required under an Experimental Fishing Permit (EFP).  Unsorted catch is placed into refrigerated seawater holds and is delivered to shore-based processing plants.  Fishing trips typically last one day.  The shore-based hake fleet consists of approximately 30 vessels that deliver their catch to about six ports.  The major portion of the fleet operates predominantly out of three Oregon ports, Charleston (Coos Bay), Newport & Astoria.  The remaining portion of the fleet (four to six vessels) delivers their catch to Westport, WA, Eureka, CA and Crescent City, CA. 
1.2  TIMELINE:  The term of this project will be conducted over approximately ten (10) months.  The dates for the shore-based hake season, coincide with the movement of hake along the coast.  The first portion of the shore-based hake season will begin on April 1, 2005, off the coast of California and represents 5% of the overall shore-based quota.  Once caught, the California season is closed.  The main season begins June 15, 2005, and is mainly fished off the Oregon and Washington coasts.  However, some California vessels may also participate in this later opener depending on fishing opportunity.  The Pacific Fishery Management Council will set the hake quota this spring.  Until then, it is unknown how long the season may last.  Early estimations are for a 60-day season. In the past, the season has ranged from 30 to 60 days.  Therefore, the California season could last two to four weeks.  The main season opening on June 15th could be open until late August.  The EMS needs to be ready for the first portion of the season thirty (30) calendar days after the commencement of the season, or approximately May 1, 2005.
1.3  OBJECTIVES OVERVIEW:  (1) Outreach, is crucial to the success of this project.  NOAA Fisheries will provide regulatory and project management information, but the contractor must outline the technical aspects and needs of the system to the fishers and receive and record fleet reaction to the systems;
(2) Provide enough EMS units for all the vessels in the fleet;
(3) Successful installation of the electronic monitoring system on each vessel in the fleet;
(4) Keep the EMS in working order, collecting the needed images, and data for analysis;
(5) Analyze the collected data;
(6) Removal of the EMS units from all the vessels; and
(7) Present the data in a report summarizing the results, highlighting the functionality of this technology on this fleet and expanding upon work accomplished during the 2004 season.  Refining last year’s technology includes providing an uninterruptible power supply to the system, experimenting with methods of estimating the amount of any discard and refining data processing methodologies.
2.0  SERVICE REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall discuss and coordinate with the COTR and NOAA Fisheries staff to review monitoring objectives, data requirements, reporting relationships, and project deliverables. Each of the objectives described below must be fully met by the contractor and keep the lines of communication open at all times.
2.1  OUTREACH:  The contractor shall design and implement an outreach program that reaches the fishers in a direct and straightforward manner.  It shall include promoting the EMS, overall operational procedures, outlining what each vessel can expect during EMS installation, vessel requirements for hosting the EMS equipment, clear explanation on what happens to the collected data at the end of the project and any other necessary details.  This must be done in conjunction with NOAA Fisheries staff.
The contractor shall (1) Participate in pre-season meetings and outreach with the fleet to provide an overall scope of the project; (2) Provide communication options to the fleet including an email, phone number and mailing address; (3) Ensure that fleet participants are clear on the EMS project goals and requirements before the installation of EMS equipment; (4) Participate in post project meetings and outreach with the fleet to give an overall summary of the project; and (5) Provide a written survey for feedback from the fleet after the EMS units are removed from the vessels.  The survey results should be included in the final report.
2.2  EMS UNITS TO BE SUPPLIED:  The contractor will provide all the EMS units necessary to supply the entire shore-based hake fleet (about 30 vessels).  The units supplied by the contractor shall meet the following technical specifications and requirements:
(1) The electronic monitoring equipment will include:   EMS computer box for logging digital video imagery and other vessel data; High capacity hard drives for storage of digital imagery; CCTV cameras; Sensor for GPS; Sensor for hydraulic pressure; Winch or net drum sensors; 12 VDC to 110 VAC power inverter (if necessary); Tamper resistant housing; and an uninterruptible power source.
(2) The EMS units will be configured to provide GPS location and date at all times while the vessel is at sea, and  CCTV imagery of all fishing operations.
2.3  INSTALLATION OF EMS UNITS ABOARD VESSESL:  Prior to commencement of the active data collection component of the project, the contractor will install, test, and initialize all the EMS equipment on the fleet’s fishing vessels.  Each vessel will be fully outfitted with EMS equipment and the vessels’ crews will be provided instruction on the use and care of the EMS equipment.  The contractor will determine the scheduling of the EMS installation for each vessel and will take into account vessels’ schedules and concerns. Installation and maintenance of the EMS technology shall not unduly delay any vessel from participating in the fishery.
2.4  MAINTENANCE OF THE EMS UNITS:  The contractor shall maintain each deployed EMS unit in order to collect necessary images and data on a continuous basis.  Following the successful initial installation of EMS equipment, the contractor shall provide EMS servicing for the fishing vessels during the length of the project as follows:  (1) If necessary, the contractor will go to sea with the fisher to demonstrate the EMS equipment and monitor EMS performance; and (2) The contractor will provide prompt, continuous service.  This includes routine maintenance and troubleshooting of EMS units, downloading data from EMS computers and performing any needed re-initialization of EMS units for future fishing trips.
2.5  DATA ANALYSIS:  The contractor will analyze the EMS data collected aboard the shore-based hake fleet and incorporate the data into a final report.  Specific data analysis and reporting tasks to be carried out by the contractor include:  (1) Inventory of all data retrieved; (2) Establishing a schedule for data processing to be agreed upon by the contractor and NOAA Fisheries staff; (3) Examining vessel sensor data to assess quality and completeness of the data set; (4) Identifying fishing episodes; (5) Identifying anomalous events in the data set that may warrant further investigation; (6) Confirming that fishing occurs within permissible locations; (7) Examining trawl haul-back procedures to confirm that all fish are retained aboard; (8) Destroying all images collected on vessels within four weeks of analysis or sooner if not needed; and (9) Collating additional fishing events as identified by NOAA Fisheries staff and the contractor.
2.6  REMOVAL OF EMS UNITS FROM FISHING VESSELS:  The contractor is responsible for removing all EMS units from the vessels at the end of the shore-based hake season.  The contractor shall remove all evidence of the EMS installation on every vessel.  Care must be taken to return each vessel to the state it was in prior to the installation of the EMS unit.  The removal shall not unduly delay vessels from departing for other fisheries.  All EMS units shall be removed from all vessels within two (2) weeks of the end of the fishery season.
3.0  REPORTING:  The contractor will provide to the COTR a draft and a final written report on this project.  As this project is to expand upon the previous year’s results, the report format should be complimentary to the 2004 season’s report; therefore, the contractor shall coordinate with the COTR for formatting approach.
The draft will allow the Government to provide comments and to edit text.  The draft report will submitted to NOAA Fisheries for comment within 60 days of the end of the shore-based hake season.
The final report shall incorporate changes suggested by the Government, shall be clear, straightforward, and will incorporate an overview of the EMS project, analysis of the EMS data and lessons learned about the technical aspects of the system.

<RESPDATE>040605

<DESC>There are three primary tasks required of this Contractor position as follows:
Task 1: Agile and adaptive plan development
 
There is a need in the defense community for development of techniques and tools that can build plans more rapidly and that can adjust plans for changes.  As stated in the DoD Adaptive Planning Roadmap, "Rapidly changing circumstances, uncertainty and complexity are the defining characteristics of the new security environment."  The document further states "To meet the challenges of the 21st century, the Department of Defense (DoD) must revolutionize the way it prepares and responds to future and current contingencies."
 
Recent research has identified two promising new technologies for solution of these needs.  These new technologies are: “agent systems” and “new measuring systems”.  “Agent systems” are fundamentally different than legacy decision systems.  Legacy systems operate at one central processing location using static and agreed upon data.  “Agent systems” are composed of many independent systems, all operating on their own.  Examples of an “agent system” are ant colonies, or high school students making dates for the senior prom.  It is intuitive that the “agent system” is more adaptive than the central, static system.  The second technology is “new measuring systems”.  Traditional measuring systems use quantitative measures (for example, probability of damage) to rank alternative assignments.  New research into alternative measuring systems allows more natural inclusion of qualitative considerations to be included in the ranking of alternatives.  These “new measuring systems” use measures such as preferences to rank alternatives.
 
This task will continue the research into these promising new technologies.  Specifically, “agent systems” and “new measurement methods” will be explored.  The research will investigate alternative approaches and build prototype evaluation tools to help evaluate promising alternatives.
Task 2: ISR/Strike interaction support

The reorganization of USSTRATCOM has created the need to better understand the interaction between ISR systems and offensive strike systems.  Most community accepted models explicitly model either strike systems or ISR systems but not both.  Few models explicitly include both types of systems.  One community model has both ISR and Strike systems and has the features that USSTRATCOM will require for its analysis tasking.  The model is the PAEP model sponsored by OSD (PA&E).  PAEP explicitly allows the consideration of:
 
-         ISR
-         Strike
-          CONOPS
-     Information utilization
 
This task will support the installation and use of the PAEP model at USSTRATCOM.  Specific subtasks will be 
 
1. Install model
2. Train users
3. Assist in building data
4. Assist in producing studies
5. Modify code for specific USSTRATCOM needs

Task 3: JICM Support
 
The Joint Integrated Contingency Model (JICM) is a large simulation system that encompasses the strategic and operational levels of land, air, and naval warfare with a global set of models and databases.  The Commander/USSTRATCOM has directed J82 to obtain the JICM model and develop the capability to use the model.  Crucial to the success of running the JICM is the proper description of the damage done when weapons are employed against targets.  An interface has been developed at the OJCS to facilitate creating damage inputs to JICM.  The interface is called DOMOD.
 
This task will support the installation and use of the DOMOD model interface at USSTRATCOM.  Specific subtasks will be 
 
1. Install model interface
2. Train users
3. Assist in building data
4. Assist in producing studies
5. Modify code for specific USSTRATCOM needs
 
Knowledge/experience/education  
The Contractor must have the requisite knowledge, experience and education to provide the support specified in the taskings.  The Contractor must be familiar with the DoD structure and he should have an engineering, computer or mathematical education/background in order that he have a functional understanding of the analyses accomplished by USSTRATCOM/J82.
 
Reports 
The contractor shall prepare an initial spend plan schedule within 30 days of contract award, and monthly status reports by the 15th of each month reporting accomplishments from the previous month, financial data from the previous month, and identifying management issues. The financial information should include hours worked, labor cost for the previous month and cumulative labor costs, and other direct costs for the previous month and cumulative other direct costs. 
Initial spend plan schedule
Upon issuance of the contract, the contractor shall prepare a spending plan schedule of how resources shall be expended during the period of performance.  The contractor shall show overall budget and planning expenditures for labor, supplies, travel and other direct costs.
Monthly resource reports
In addition to required invoices, the contractor shall submit monthly resource reports, whether resources are expended or not, to the government.  These reports shall show in tabular and graphical form, how actual expenses compare to the spending plan schedule.  These reports shall, in table form, break out expenditures by labor categories and non-labor totals; and in graphic form, show accumulated labor and non-labor expenditures relative to both planned and total budget amounts.  Reports shall be provided as MS-Excel worksheets and charts.  These reports shall also contain a short narrative of progress and milestone events.
Travel 
The Contractor will travel to USSTRATCOM at Offutt AFB for an initial period of at least one week for face-to-face meetings with J82 in order to develop priorities and deliverable timelines at the beginning of the contract award period.  Following this initial meeting between the contractor and J82, the contractor will travel to USSTRATCOM/J82 at Offutt AFB on a monthly/bi-monthly basis (not to exceed 7 trips total) and spend approximately one week each trip reviewing taskings’ progress and providing deliverables as agreed to during the initial meeting at the beginning of the contract period with USSTRATCOM/J82 personnel.
Special Requirements 
Security Level 
The contractor candidate must have a current SBI in order to obtain a Top Secret clearance immediately and be fully functional without delay.
Building/Computer Access 
The contractor shall comply with all installation rules and regulations applicable to personal conduct, safety, security, and site entry and exit.  The contractor shall comply with all computer regulations as set forth by the Designated Approval Authority (DAA) for computer operations within USSTRATCOM IAW SI 306-1.
Place of Performance/Travel 
With the exception of travel as indicated below, the contractor shall perform most duties at his private office located in Colorado. 
Government Furnished Property/Material 
All government furnished information, material, and property will be returned to the government at contract completion. 
Government Furnished Information 
The government will provide the contractor with access to information and documentation on past and current programs necessary to meet the requirements of the SOW in a timely manner. The government will provide the contractor access to classified and unclassified computer networks required to perform the tasks outlined in this SOW. 
Government Furnished Material 
The government will provide the contractor with material and documentation necessary to perform the tasks outlined in this SOW.
Government Furnished Property

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-05-R-625535 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and offers being requested.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.    The NAICS is 721110.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award of a contract will be based on the following criteria:  Past Performance and price.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract/s without discussions.  Therefore, offeror’s initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5. ******** The Coast Guard has a requirement to provide temporary BERTHING & MESSING in Seward, AK, for the crew of USCGC STORIS, during the period of 15 May through 12 June 2005.

NOTE: Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail service are not routed directly to the above address.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).  Evaluation Factors:  
Operational Effectiveness – Describe your ability to currently meet the performance requirements stated in the Performance Specification for the RPS.  Key features to address include Technical Compliance with Specification, Ruggedization, Size and Weight, and Additional (Value) Features.   Supportability - Key Supportability issues to address include Durability, Technical Data, and Warranty. Address any specific commercial or extended warranty provisions for the product.  Past Performance - Provide specific examples of favorable recent past performance that illustrates evidence of your ability to produce, deliver, and warrant your product.  Ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number and a description of the items procured.  Relative Order of Importance:   (i) Operational Effectiveness - Most important. (ii) Supportability – Next in importance.  (iii) Past Performance - Less important. Price - Evaluated, but not rated.  Award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal presents the best value to the Government.  In making its "Best Value" determination, the Government will consider overall technical, supportability, and past performance merit to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price.  However, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination will increase with the degree of equality in the overall merits of the proposals.  Failure to meet each and every requirement will not automatically disqualify an offeror from consideration for contract award.  The government will utilize the PS to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of each offeror's technical solution.  Value Added features, as listed by the Government or proposed by the offeror will be factored in.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations.  FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B. Destination. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS: Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form. Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided. Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the original posting for this requirement. This amendment serves to correct errors in the original requirement, as well as to provide answers to questions submitted regarding the requirement. The following both corrects errors and answers questions:

Questions & Answers:

1.	Q - Would the Government consider expanding the commuting distance criteria beyond the (25) mile radius in order to include Harrisburg, PA?	
A – There is a need for participants to have access to resources such as the computer labs, the publications center, & the Learning Resource Center/Library located at the National Emergency Training Center (NETC), as well as the need for numerous NETC staff members to travel to and from the facility as required. Therefore, the facility must be within a reasonable commuting distance from the NETC. Based upon these necessary minimum logistical issues, the area of consideration cannot be expanded beyond the (25) mile surrounding area.
2.	Q - Will any catering be needed?
    	A - No
3.  	Q - If there is a parking charge, is the Government or the participant responsible for the charge?
	A – No.  The individual participant will be responsible for the charge.
4.	Q - Will the Government require a registration table or help from a project manager at each location for registration, or will the Government provide this person?
	A - The Government will provide the registration table and personnel required to manage the table.
5.	Q - Will the Government be mailing/sending any workbooks, documentation, etc. for the training to the motel/hotel? If yes, how many boxes and what are the dimensions?
	A - No the Government will not be mailing any materials to the motel/hotel.
6.	Q - If you want the offeror to provide any AV, what size of screen will be needed?
	A - As stated in the posting, the Government will provide all AV equipment as needed.
7.	Q - What is the agenda for this training?
A - Currently the only agenda is: Four (4) Train-the-Trainer programs. Any other specific agenda outside of the below training modules has not been confirmed at this point. 
NIMS ICS for the Fire Service
NIMS ICS for EMS
Introduction to Unified Command
NIMS, An Introduction (facilitated version)
8.	Q - The number of nights requiring lodging appears to be incorrect. How many nights lodging are required for each of the (3) training sessions?
	A - There was an error in the number of lodging nights. The May & June classes require a total of (7) nights lodging as opposed to the (6) as originally posted, and the July class requires a total of (6) nights lodging as opposed to the (5) posted.
