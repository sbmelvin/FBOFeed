<DESC>Pursuant to its authorities under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), U.S. Department of State provides support to foreign governments’ counter-narcotics and law enforcement programs throughout the world.  The U.S. Department of State, Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) of the U.S. Embassy in La Paz, Bolivia has a requirement for the procurement of approximately two hundred thirty (230) new vehicles to fill requirements for expanding NAS operations in Bolivia.  The primary use of the vehicles will be for the transportation of personnel and supplies to support these operations.  The vehicles must be suitable for extensive travel in rural areas and smaller cities and towns, where deeply rutted and unpaved roads are the norm.  They must also be suitable for travel to remote and mountainous regions, which are accessible only by difficult-to-drive, twisting, narrow, and unpaved roads that border 3000 to 5000 foot drops.  The vehicles will also be used for travel to densely forested areas, and must be dependable in heavy mud, which is often encountered during rainy season.  At minimum, the vehicles must meet the following specifications: 4 x 4 long bed, direct access; manual transmission, 5 speed floor shaft; 4 wheel drive traction with high and low transference box; gasoline injection; hydraulic steering; full front and rear air conditioning; hydraulic clutch; 6 or 8 cylinder engine with not less than 4000cc; 12 volt electrical system; hydraulic front disc brakes; hydraulic disc or drum rear brakes; rigid axle with spring front suspension, spiral type; rigid axle rear suspension, floating axle with leaf springs; minimum of 90 liter capacity for main fuel tank and 80 liter capacity for auxiliary tank; minimum of 10 person passenger capacity; front and rear vinyl seats with head rests and seat belts; manual windows; 5 tires (including spare) 750” x 16” or equivalent; steel 16” detachable rims; 1 set jack and accessories, caution plate triangle, and owner’s manual; standard winch, and standard mirrors, inside lights, and sun visors.  Vehicles offered must be capable of being maintained commercially in Bolivia in locations away from the main urban areas and must be covered by the manufacturer’s warrantees.  Offerors must demonstrate that the vehicles offered can withstand continuous use in Bolivia’s extremely rugged terrain and harsh climatic conditions, and that the vehicles are cost-effective to operate and maintain.  Evaluation criteria for this procurement include the past performance of the products offered in terms of durability, reliability and safety; and their cost to maintain and repair.  The solicitation is planned for release to qualified offerors in May, 2004.  The required time for delivery of the vehicles will be one hundred twenty (120) days from contract execution. The total amount of vehicles will be delivered in three (3) stages.  All deliveries must be CIF Aduana, La Paz. The resulting contract type shall be firm-fixed price, and the award will be made based on best value to the Government, technical and price considerations included.  However, because these vehicles are being financed under a USG foreign assistance program, responsive proposals from U.S. offerors will be given preferred consideration.  In order to obtain a copy of the solicitation package offerors must forward their written requests via fax to Mr. Robert A. Lindquist at (954) 630-1165, or by e-mail to LindquistRA@state.gov by April 30, 2004.  Proposals will be accepted from both U.S. and non-U.S. firms, and from both large and small businesses.

<DESC>This procurement is a Low Priced Technical Acceptable Request for Proposal Best Value negotiated procurement for construction services and is full and open competition.  Responsible offers will be evaluated on the basis of Best Value to the Governmen t.  The factors used to determine the Best Value are as follows: FACTOR 1. Past Performance.  FACTOR 2. Corporate Experience.  FACTOR 3.  Key Personnel.   FACTOR 4. Schedule.  FACTOR 5. Quality Control Management Program (QCMP).  FACTOR 6. Price.   The Contractor is responsible for installing a remedial water stop system in the joint between monoliths 6 and 7.  The remedial water stop system consists of a tube-type liner, filler material, drill hole, and manhole cover.  The Contractor shall submit th e remedial water stop system for approval.  When the Government approves the remedial water stop system, the Contractor shall install the remedial water stop system.  Following installation of the water stop, the Contractor shall clean the site.  The Contr actor shall then submit a final report upon completion of the work.   The structural concrete portion of the dam consists of a powerhouse with six slant axis turbines, a concrete gravity ogee spillway with four 40-foot wide tainter gates, and a stilling basin, 181 feet wide by 206 feet long.   Powerhouse portion of the dam c onsists of 3 concrete monoliths labeled as monoliths 6, 7 and 8.  Monoliths 6, 7 and 8 are founded on rock at elevation 583.0 feet.  Copper water stops were placed between the monoliths (monolith joints) to control water seepage into the dam.  These water stops isolate the interior of the dam from water in the reservoir, foundation and downstream channel.  Inspections of the vertical water stop drains at the upstream face of the dam revealed the upstream water stop between monoliths 6 and 7 has failed.   The type of remedial water stop used shall be a vertical drill hole with a continuous tube-type liner inserted in the hole.  The liner shall be filled with water or a water-based filler material as required allowing the remedial water stop system to functi on as specified herein.  The liner and filler material shall rely on differential pressure between the interior of the liner and the external water level to force the liner against the sides of the drilled hole.  The filler material and liner shall be remo vable to allow for future inspection or replacement without requiring drilling procedures.  The drilled hole shall be placed upstream of the existing water stops and drain and shall be drilled vertically from elevation 759.25 feet (top of dam) to elevation  578.0 feet (5 feet below the bedrock foundation of monoliths 6 and 7) The magnitude of this procurement is between $250,000 and $500,000.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate quotes on the basis of technical, price and past performance.  The selection of a contractor for award will be based on the quality and specification strength in the area of the offeror’s technical proposal (offeror shall include detailed product description that highlights specifications and qualifications).  Offerors are cautioned that unsupported promises to comply with the RFQ requirements will not be sufficient.  Quotes must provide convincing documentary evidence in support of any conclusionary statements relating to promised performance.  The price will be considered, although of lesser importance than the technical proposal.  Offerors should provide references for a minimum of three of the offeror’s customers (contracts and/or subcontracts) for items of similar scope.  Projects cited and past performance references should be recent (within the last 3 years of the date of the quote).  The references should be limited to a brief description of the service provided, together with client points of contact (include email address and phone number of references).  Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services during the past three years.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.  The offeror’s record of past performance, or the lack thereof, will be an important factor in the assessment of the risk involved in the offeror’s quote.  The technical quote will be more significant then the price quotes.  However, price and past performance are of equal importance.  Offerors shall also discuss how they will be able to comply with the delivery requirements.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.216-1, Type of Contract, the Government anticipates award of a firm-fixed-price contract, with delivery 180 days ARO.  Acceptance will be in Rabiya, Iraq (grid zone coordinates: 38S KF 100 780).

The Offerors will provide no more than two pages of past performance information.  Use type characters no smaller that 10 pitch.  Each instance of relevant past performance shall include the contract number and/or delivery order number, contract type, contract value, whether competitive or sole source, description of work, and customer point of contact including e-mail address and telephone number.  Offerors’ technical proposal (including delivery terms) shall be no longer than three pages.  Use type characters no smaller that 10 pitch.  Offerors’ pricing data shall be no longer than three pages.  Use type characters no smaller that 10 pitch.  No attachments are allowed and only the front of a page shall be used.  A page that has material on back and front will count as two pages.  The contracting officer may determine proposals that deviate from these type-size and page limitations as non-responsive.  Offerors shall submit an original proposal and one copy.  The proposal shall be easily segregated between the contract line item (CLIN) price, technical, and past performance.  Both the original and copy may be transmitted via e-mail.  The copy of the proposal submitted is for evaluation purposes and shall not bear any logos, trademarks, company names or points of contact information that would identify the Offeror.

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as required delivery dates, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal, who meets the government’s required delivery dates, will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors may be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision)
