<DESC>This BAA is open and effective until November 15, 2006; POC: Dr. Brian Pierce, DARPA/SPO Deputy Director, is the overall technical POC for this BAA, e-mail: Brian.Pierce@darpa.mil. Contact information for the SPO Program Managers (PMs) under each technical area is specified in the PIP. Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact the relevant PMs directly before submitting a response to this BAA. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Special Projects Office (DARPA/SPO) researches, develops, demonstrates and transitions technologies focused on addressing present and emerging national challenges. SPO investments range from the development of enabling technologies to the demonstration of large prototype systems. Innovative concepts are sought for research efforts to enable U.S. dominance over the proliferating threat posed by our adversarys use of underground structures.  Emphasis is on the development and demonstration of technologies to find unknown facilities on both strategic and tactical timescales; to identify facility function, to monitor pace of activity, to determine structural layout or locations of specific vulnerabilities; and to enhance post-attack bomb damage assessment (BDA).  Prospective innovations include: exploitation of novel observables or substantially improved methods of detecting/analyzing observables, including active source methods; improved deployable ground and airborne sensors; improved communications across rugged terrain among assets, and for exfiltration uplinks; new methods for sensor and system modeling; exploitation algorithms and signal processing; and new methods for characterizing activities associated with tunnels and caves.  These include small and unimproved sites, including those in urban areas.  Both close-in and standoff sensor concepts are of interest. Innovative concepts for space systems, sensors, structures, components and materials are sought to support next-generation tactical space operations including rapid access, space situational awareness, space control, robust anti-jam SATCOM, and persistent tactical grade sensing approaches including extremely large space apertures and structures. Of particular interest are large distributed array remote sensing systems, both space based and ground based, for space object location and identification and concepts that support affordable access –and thus proliferation – of high-performance space control sensors and systems;  novel access and propulsion concepts; innovative sensor systems concepts in support of the spectrum of space control applications including extremely large, yet lightweight and stowable aperture technologies; lightweight and low-mass active/passive  membranes; large space structures that have extremely small payload volumes (e.g., rigidized inflatables, isogrid composites, etc.); active damping and smart materials for precision control of space structures; self assembly and/or manufacture; novel space-based sensor modalities and systems; high performance micro- and picosat systems; and next generation power generation systems including electrodynamic and momentum tethers, and advanced solar systems. Innovative sensor system and technology concepts are sought across all phases of conflict. Specific technologies of interest include: highly adaptive remote sensing systems that employ externally and internally cued localized onboard processing (i.e. foveated vision) to optimize bandwidth utilization for high frame rate and time critical persistent surveillance applications; very large, low cost, lightweight, and low power density, active phased arrays applicable to space-, airship-, and ground-based radar systems; highly integrated platform-sensor systems with ultra long endurance and minimal logistics tails; stratospheric airship platforms and support systems for large phased array radars and communication systems; efficient and lightweight solar cell and power storage technologies; station-keeping concepts and technologies; lightweight materials and construction methods including inflatable structures; ultra-wideband (greater than 10:1) phased arrays and shared aperture architecture concepts; innovative calibration and alignment methods; low-loss packaged RF phase shifters, switches and T/R modules; lightweight beamformer, control, and power distribution concepts; highly integrated, compact sensor systems amenable to low logistics support deployments; close-in deployment schemes including unattended ground and air sensors; through-wall sensing and building interior mapping; self-geolocation and LPI comms; advanced intelligent signal processing methods that maximize sensor performance and robustness in hostile operating environments; real-time exploitation of environmental/situational knowledge bases; novel, knowledge-aided, adaptive waveform methods leveraging the emergence of software programmability especially those amenable to real-time embedded computing architectures; model-based reasoning for deconvolving radar signals; radar operation in high multipath or dispersive environments. Innovative concepts are sought in systems and component technologies to address a variety of chem/bio/rad/nuclear threats, including threats to buildings and urban environments.  Technologies of interest include those appropriate to the protection from, detection of, neutralization of, or decontamination of such agents, either during a release (aerosolized agent), after a release (deposited on surfaces) or prior to release (in containers).  Systems of particular interest are those that support real-time, dynamic response of buildings; wide-area urban surveillance for pre-symptomatic detection of releases; protection of areas/spaces with high concentrations of people; high-throughput techniques for quantifying residual contamination levels in the wake of a Bio-Warfare Agent (BWA) attack (e.g., on building surfaces, documents, etc.); studies and modeling of protective systems, protective components, or the transport of agents; Advanced lightweight personal protective systems that do not increase the soldier's heat burden; and data collections to support component development, modeling, and system validation. New technologies in support of assured urban operations are sought. Particular areas of interest include networked and highly distributed emplaced urban sensor systems that have the potential to provide highly responsive, adaptive and even predictive awareness for urban ops; extremely rapid barrier deployment and removal (both for personnel and vehicle applications, sealing off buildings); non-lethal weapons; persistent and ubiquitous intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (including building penetration techniques and standoff detection of explosives); asymmetric weapons countermeasures (such as methods to counter Improvised Explosive Devices or IEDs); detection of weapons caches; and methods for infrastructure protection and rapid replenishment; signature reduction technologies for urban combat;  reduction of visible, IR, olfactory, and auditory signatures; novel sensor architectures and innovative algorithms for operating in dense urban clutter. New technologies in support of combat casualty care are sought.  Particular areas of interest include battlefield portable high resolution imaging tools; automated tools that allow for the delivery of first aid such as IVs by untrained personnel or by the soldier himself; and advanced methods for treating injuries on the battlefield. Innovative concepts are sought for research efforts that lead to significant military capability improvement in the area of guidance and navigation. Of particular interest are technologies that allow precision navigation in GPS denied scenarios including jamming environments, building interiors, underground facilites, etc. Methods are sought that employ both natural and/or manmade signals of opportunity as well as novel next generation extremely compact INS technologies. In all of these areas, SPO efforts encompass the full range of activities required to develop complete prototype systems, from hardware development and characterization to algorithms, exploitation techniques, and full-scale system experimentation. Proposed efforts may address the development of prototype components, or systems; studies and modeling of existing or proposed systems; and data collections that will overcome deficiencies in existing data. The PIP provides additional information and POCs for these areas of interest; Proposers are encouraged to contact these POCs before submitting a response to this BAA. 
This information is provided to focus interest on innovative concepts that contribute to ongoing SPO investments, but is not meant to preclude white papers on other research efforts that seek to address emerging threats or enhance the US ability to operate in challenging environments. 
PROGRAM SCOPE: The main purpose of this BAA is to provide exploratory funding to determine the suitability of an idea for further substantial investment. Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY 05 and may occur at any time through the closing date as funds are available. Individual awards are expected to be shorter than 12 months and less than $1M. Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  GENERAL INFORMATION: In response to this BAA SPO is accepting proposal abstracts followed potentially by full proposals. The purpose of the abstract is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an Proposer whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. To further reduce burden, it is suggested that the Proposer directly contact the cognizant Program Manager (PM) by email (preferably) or telephone prior to submission of an abstract to ensure Proposers ideas are aligned with DARPA/SPO needs. The PIP contains a further detailed delineation of topic areas of interest as well as a list of cognizant PMs. For those submitting abstracts, a PM most closely related to the submitted topic will review within approximately 30 days. A written response will then be sent to the Proposer.   
Those Proposers whose abstract are found to be of interest and consistent with the intent of this BAA will be encouraged to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such encouragement does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award. Abstracts and proposals determined to not be of interest under this BAA will not be considered if resubmitted unless significant changes in the approach or new technical information becomes available. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement. Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria: a) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit; b) Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/SPO Mission; c) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition; d) Proposers Capabilities and Related Experience; e) Cost Realism.  Awards will be made to those proposers whose proposals are considered most advantageous to the government. All awards will be subject to availability of government funds. The government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement and to make award without discussions. No portion of the BAA will be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) or minority institutions (MI) participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete severable areas of research for exclusive competition among the entries. DARPA/SPO will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. If a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. The point of contact for classified responses is the Director of SPO Security at 703-812-1984. Proposers who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their proposal should contact this POC before submitting a response.  Information generated after award may be controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 CFR 120-130, therefore contractors may be required to protect information pursuant to the ITAR and are encouraged to consider this when proposing.  SUBMISSION INFORMATION: DARPA will employ an electronic upload process for abstract/proposal submissions for BAA 06-02.  Abstracts will be submitted via http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa. Performers may find guidance for abstract/proposal submission at: http://www.darpa.mil/spo/solicitations.htm.This announcement and the PIP may be retrieved via the WWW at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ in the solicitations area. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. Proposers are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001, intends to solicit L-3 Communications Titan Corporation, Visicom Services Division, 7436 Mission Valley Road, San Diego, CA 92108-4401, on a sole-source basis for engineering and technical services, and associated materials, necessary to provide Life Cycle Sustainment Management (LCSM) support for Special Warfare Programs, including the MK V Special Operations Craft, Navy Special Warfare Rigid Inflatable Boat (NSW RIB), Patrol Boat Light - Counter Drug (PBL-CD) and Special Operations Craft - Riverine (SOCR).  This acquisition is for services for Titan to maintain the Point and Click Research Assistance Tool (PACRAT).  NSWC PC tasked Titan, in a delivery order under a local Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity contract, to develop an Integrated Allowance Document (IAD) in support of the MK V SOC.  Titan distributed this electronic file to the Fleet each quarter, wh!  ere it was well received.  During subsequent fleet assist visits, Titan employees discovered that the fleet needed an interactive tool that would enable the maintainers to communicate better with the supply department.  Titan then took the initiative and developed an advanced version of the IAD, which is now called the Point and Click Research Assistant Tool (PACRAT).  PACRAT is an electronic parts breakdown that shows the physical location of parts, photographs, part numbers, National Stock Numbers (NSNs), and vendor information vital to the SBT Storekeeper (name, address, CAGE, phone number, etc).  This software is unique to the Special Operations community and is administered by Titan Corporation, who controls the source code for the program.  All efforts for the development of the PACRAT program were funded by Titan.  Accordingly, the government does not have the ability to transfer the software to any other contractor to provide the required support.  A five-year term !  Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity type contract is anticipated.   Specific delivery dates will be established within the individual orders issued under the resultant contract. All deliveries, unless otherwise specified within any individual delivery order, will be made to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  NAICS Code 541330 applies.  SBA Size Standard is $23M.  PSC is R599.  A contract will be awarded on the basis of the proposal submitted in response to the RFP on or about Jan 06.

<DESC>*CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES -
                 CORRECT CODING INITIATIVE*

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) anticipates award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract set aside for small business for the Correct Coding Initiative (CCI).  This fraud, waste and abuse contract will provide services to/for:
  •Maintain and further expand the current correct coding edits   to ensure proper coding for Medicare Part B and Hospital Outpatient services;
  •Maintenance of the associated manuals and of ongoing tasks, such as education to the provider community, replying to correspondence, etc.;
  •Continuous maintenance of the current CCI Comprehensive/Component and CCI Mutually Exclusive edit tables (procedure to procedure edits) and develop and provide continuous maintenance of Medically Unbelievable Edits;
  •Continuous maintenance of the CCI Coding Policy Manual, the CCI Correspondence Language manual; 
  •Maintenance of existing edits to identify inaccuracies, and any necessary corrections upon approval from CMS;
  •Establish and maintain databases to support deliverables related to quarterly replacements of the edits and to provide an audit trail pertaining to all decisions relating to the edits; and,
  •Establish and provide quarterly replacements compatible with CMS requirements for transmission of the data to the carriers’ claims processing systems and establish and provide an audit trail capable of responding to queries. 

The incumbent contractor will transition the current work to the new incoming contractor.  There will be an approximate two week transition period incorporated into the contract for this purpose.  In an attempt to improve the understanding of the CCI requirements, to allow potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government’s requirements, and to increase efficiency in proposal preparation, CMS is releasing the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) for this effort with this announcement.  Attached is a copy of the Draft SOW CMS anticipates incorporating into the Request for Proposal (RFP).  

CMS anticipates an October 26th solicitation release for a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract with a two week transition period, a base year and four (4), one-year (1) option periods.  Again, this is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE for which only Small Business Concerns will be eligible to participate.  Any questions should be directed to Ms. Amy Duckworth, Contract Specialist, 410-786-3111, or via e-mail at Amy.Duckworth@cms.hhs.gov.  *PLEASE USE THIS EMAIL ADDRESS AND NOT THE ONE LISTED UNDER POINT OF CONTACT.*
E-mail communications should include company name, type of small business, address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers.  Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training System Division (TSD) in Orlando, FL, intends to award a follow-on sole source Contract to MPRI, Inc., 1201 E. Abingdon Drive, STE 425, Alexandria, VA 22314 to continue to provide a program of in-country contractor support for Peace Keeping Operations (PKO) to the Nigerian Armed Forces (NAF) Simulation Center located in Jaji, Nigeria under Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) case S4-B-AVD.

c. Provide IT materials obtained from local vendors to upgrade the simulation hardware of the center for compatibility with the latest version of JCATS.

The resulting contract will be issued using other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-- (A), Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  Pursuing award through competition would result in substantial duplication of costs that the Government would not recover through competition and would also result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling critical mission requirements, potentially leading to the unavailability of training for the staff of the Nigerian Simulation Center. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, with a small business size standard not to exceed $23,000,000 .

This solicitation will be issued as an unrestricted solicitation with other than full and open competition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The safety pawl (P/N 12524384) is a critical component to operation and safety of the M242 25MM Automatic Gun.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization,  PL8221, Scott AFB IL, intends to issue a sole source contract to AT&T Government Solutions, 1900 Gallows Road, Vienna, VA 22182, for Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) Transmission Services - CONUS (DTS-C) Access Optimization (A/O) services.  The proposed contract will provide transmission and bandwidth manager services currently being provided under Contract No. DCA200-97-D-0048, DTS-C, and DCA200-96-D-0096, Defense Switched/Bandwidth Manager Services - CONUS (DS/BMS-C), respectively.  No change will occur at the user locations; user sites will be rehomed to AT&T Points-of-Presence(POPs)/Bandwidth Managers serving the new DISN Core. This will result in a reduction in access/egress OC-3 connections from 35 bandwidth managers and approximately 4,400 circuits to eight new DISN Core and 19 ESONET connections from AT&T's network. This bridge contract will provide continued DISN transmission services until the follow-on DISN Access Transport Services (DATS) contract is awarded and circuits can be transitioned from the DTS-C A/O contract to the DATS.  

Place of Performance is various U.S. Government and contractor facilities within CONUS.  The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a period of performance of  a 12-month base period with two 1-year option periods.  This action is critical to ensure continuation of telecommunications services that support the CONUS sustaining base information infrastructure and allow continuation of telecommunication services.  To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DOD cannot afford any disruption of these telecommunications services.  Follow-on actions for replacement services are in process within the DISN Next Generation Program Office through the competitive DATS Request for Proposal.   AT&T is the only contractor that can provide support at the level required in the timeframe available.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  North American Association Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) Code 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers, applies.  See numbered note 22.  Points of contact are Carrie Ross, email Carrie.Ross@disa.mil or June Tharp, email June.Tharp@disa.mil.

<DESC>This is a request for information only and does not commit the government, the Navy, or FISC to any course of action following the completion of maintenance of the base telephone equipment. Responses to the RFI cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The government’s purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas, and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of any future procurement for these services.  The government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.  Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed, but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package.  

The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Puget Sound has a requirement for maintenance of the following base telephone equipment located at Naval Station Everett, Everett WW and its detachments:  Naval Station Everett-Main Switch (Meridian 1, Opt 81), Network Management System, Meridian Voice Mail, Modem Pools, Operator Consoles, and Conference Bridges; Marysville, WA- Meridian 1, Opt 51; and Arlington, WA (Jim Creek)- Remote Intelligent Peripheral Equipment (IPE) Shelf.  The contractor shall be responsible for maintenance of all items connected to the systems such as the battery and rectifier systems, proprietary digital telephone sets and fiber optic and copper cable plant.  The contract shall also include labor and material for installation and repair of copper and fiber optic cables, splicing and cable location at Naval Station Everett, WA; Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Whidbey Island, WA; Naval Magazine Facility, Port Hadlock, WA; and Naval Submarine Base, Bangor, Silverdale WA.  The requirement will be for a base year with two one-year options.  The Government intends to negotiate this requirement as a Hub-zone set aside.   

Replies are not mandatory and will be separated from, and have no bearing on subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting request for proposals or quotations.  The use of comments received from industry to complete final statements of work and resulting solicitation documents will be at the sole discretion of the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Puget Sound.     Eligibility in participating in future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this RFI.  The government will not critique a potential offeror’s comments and the government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the RFI. Proprietary information is not being solicited.     Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such.  Responses to this RFI must be submitted no later than 23 November 2005 in writing to: Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Puget Sound, Code 230AM, Bldg 467 “W” Street, Bremerton WA 98314 or by email at anne.marotti@navy.mil

Failure to meet the minimum experience requirements may result in a non-responsive determination.  Per the Debt Collections Improvement Act of 1996, The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFAR) has been amended to require all contractors to register in the Department of Defense (DOD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database. Be advised, failure to register in the CCR makes an offeror ineligible for award of DOD contracts.

<SUBJECT>R -- Audit Support for Universal Service Administrative Company for Support Mechanisms
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-USAC-1
<ARCHDATE>12312005
<CONTACT>Wilma Mooney, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-418-1865, Fax 202-418-5963, Email wilma.mooney@fcc.gov
<DESC>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed that all providers of interstate telecommunications services contribute to a federal universal service support mechanism in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner and that there be specific, predictable, and sufficient federal and state mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has by federal regulation designated the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), a private not for profit company, to administer the universal service support mechanisms for schools, libraries, rural health care providers, high cost areas, and low income consumers.  USAC manages the Universal Service Fund (USF) in its administration of these support mechanisms.
In its role as Administrator, USAC has the responsibility to take measures to prevent, deter and detect waste, fraud, and abuse involving the USF and the universal support mechanisms, and to report to the FCC and Congress regarding actions to prevent waste, fraud and abuse.  In fulfilling its responsibilities, USAC works closely with the FCC Office of Inspector General (OIG).  The oversight responsibility of the FCC OIG is to independently detect and prevent waste, fraud, and abuse with respect to all FCC programs, including the USF.  USAC, in consultation with the OIG, developed the requirements of this Request for Proposals (RFP).  The purpose of this procurement is to conduct beneficiary audits that will enable USAC, in consultation with FCC OIG, to:  (1) detect waste, fraud, and abuse by beneficiaries of the universal service support mechanisms, (2) deter waste, fraud, and abuse by beneficiaries of the universal service support mechanisms, (3) generate insights about the compliance of beneficiaries with applicable law and the quality of administration of the universal service support mechanisms, and (4) identify areas for improvement in the compliance of beneficiaries with applicable law and the administration of the universal service mechanisms.  The preliminary number of audits to be performed nationwide is 710.  Under a multiple contract award, we anticipate qualifying an adequate amount of contract resources to accomplish these within approximately eighteen months of contract award.  We will adjust this schedule as necessary should we be unable to obtain adequate resources from qualified bidders.  The number of audits to be performed for the remaining term of the contract(s) will be determined after completion and analysis of the results of the initial 710 audits.  The estimated number of initial audits is sufficient to calculate an estimated error rate of improper payments in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance regarding the Improper Payment Information Act (IPIA).  Audits shall be conducted in accordance with Generally Accepted Audit Standards (GAAS), Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS), and Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), Public Law 107-300.  The RFP also requires offerors to have the capability to provide investigative support services.  
This contracting action replaces a prior USAC competitive procurement for these audit services that commenced in November 2004.  All previous offerors are encouraged to submit proposals.  In addition, new offerors are also invited to submit proposals.  

It is anticipated that this solicitation will result in multiple awards to allow for competition between the awardees for specific task orders.  Awarded contracts will have a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  It is anticipated that Time and Material (T&M) task orders will be awarded for the first 710 audits.  This will be followed by fixed price task orders, when ever possible, for the audits authorized for the remaining term of the contract(s).  Time and material task orders will be awarded for all investigative services.  Due to the number of potential relationships between offerors and contributors, service providers, and/or beneficiaries of the USF, offerors will be required to disclose any actual or potential personal or organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs), as well as their process for identifying and evaluating potential or actual OCIs.  A mitigation plan shall be required if an actual or potential conflict of interest is identified by disclosure or other means.  It should be noted that if an offeror’s proposed mitigation plan is deemed to be inadequate to avoid, neutralize, or adequately mitigate an identified actual or potential OCI, then the offeror’s proposal will be subject to disqualification without further evaluation. 
The deadline for submission of proposals will be stated in the RFP.  Late and non-responsive proposals shall not be evaluated or considered for award.
Copies of the RFP will be made available electronically at http://www.universalservice.org no earlier than 15 days after publication of this synopsis, or can be requested by FAX at 202-776-0080, or by phone at 202-776-0200.

<DESC>The Tongass National Forest intends to award a sole source contract to Western Ecosystems Technology, Inc. for the development of a quantitative method that will use population abundance of juvenile coho salmon as a monitoring tool for management prescriptions for the Tongass Land Management Plan.  Western Ecosystems Technology, Inc., is uniquely qualified due to its involvement in earlier stages of the statistical protocol development.  

Tasks include:
1.	The contractor will conduct and complete a power analysis using the three year data set collected in the pilot study.  The data set is comprised of density estimates of juvenile coho salmon population estimates from small streams throughout southeast Alaska. The purpose of the power analysis is to determine sample sizes for a ten year monitoring protocol as described in the study plan. The power analysis will use a set of pre-determined error rates of for Type I and Type II errors for a set of specified effect size sizes to detect differences between a control and treatment over a specified period of time (ten years). 
2.	Conduct and complete the statistical analysis in accordance with the methods described in the study plan to determine differences among three treatments of watersheds dispersed throughout southeast Alaska. The analysis will use data collected during a three year period of population abundance of juvenile coho salmon and associated species and habitat data that may be related to population abundance. The purpose of the analysis is to determine if differences in abundance of juvenile coho salmon can be detected among three silviculture treatments and the potential effects of stream habitat conditions on these differences. 
3.	The contractor will assist with the interpretation of the results of the power and statistical analysis and with the preparation of the final report for the pilot study that will incorporate the analysis. The contractor will also assist with the statistical methods for the completion of the long-term monitoring protocol. This task will incorporate the results from the power analysis and modifications of the methods used in the pilot study.  

Milestones (timelines):

1.	Task 1 will be completed within six (6) weeks following delivery of the data.  The first two years of data will be delivered as soon as this contracted is implemented and work can begin at that time. The remaining data is expected to be delivered by 30 December 2005.

2.	Task 2 will be completed by 30 April 2006. The complete data set will be delivered to the contractor by 30 December 2005.  

3.	 Task 3 will be completed by February 28. It will require considerable consultation between the contractor and the PI for this study.

Deliverables:

1.	Results from task 1 will be in the form of a brief written report describing methods and results. Results may be presented in tables and graphs for the specified range of values used in the analysis. An electronic version will also be provided in an agreed upon format. 

2.	Results for task 2 will be presented in a similar format as for task 1. The description of the methods will also include details of the statistical analysis in an electronic version and copies of transformed data used in the analysis.

3.	The work for task 3 will be part of a final report, a technical report (PNW GTR), and a peer-reviewed paper prepared by the PI.  The contract will prepare sections of the final report and the technical report that pertain to the completed analysis from tasks 1 and 2.  This will also provide the basis for the peer-reviewed publication prepared by the PI. The contract may provide statistical review of the peer-reviewed publication and may participate as a coauthor in the paper. 

Firms or individuals who believe they possess the qualifications to undertake the above described work and provide the deliverables within the prescribed timeframe are invited to submit their qualifications via email to Stephen Patton (spatton@fs.fed.us) not later than close of business, November 29, 2005.

<DESC>NOTE: This is only a Request for Information (RFI), not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not considered a commitment by the Government. All information received will be for planning purposes only. The Secondary Power Commodity Council (SPCC) does not intend to award a contract on the basis of your response nor otherwise pay for the preparations of any information presented or the use of any such information. The RFI responses will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government. All proprietary information should be marked as such. 

This effort is to increase reliability and improve material availability with quality and cost savings benefits of secondary power systems through Performance Based Logistics (PBL). The PBL concept is to move away from managing individual parts, repairs, etc., and into an arrangement that supports reliability and delivery support.  In this case, the purchase will be based on Power by the Flight Hour, a utility-based pricing model whereby the contractor is paid a fixed rate per flying hour.  This PBL approach is the preferred Department of Defense product support strategy to improve weapons system/component readiness by procuring performance.  The cornerstone of PBL is the purchase of weapons system/component sustainment as an affordable, integrated package based on output measures such as component availability and reliability, rather than input measures, such as parts and technical services.  The end item will be delivery of reliability and support to the warfighter.  The weapon systems include, but not limited to, F-16 and KC-135 aircrafts.  The contractor must have the necessary design, manufacturing, production, and process data capable to provide the performance outcomes, predetermined levels of availability (i.e. delivery within 2-4 days CONUS, 5 days OCONUS, etc.), reliability increases from technology insertion, engineering for design changes, and technical data revisions for the Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation (HSC) secondary power systems.  Also, the degree of reliability improvements being sought are of a nature that they will likely require the OEM to be deeply involved in configuration management issues and systems engineering design, i.e. some of the reliability improvements sought will result in significant system design changes which will require access to original design data and OEM intellectual property.  This effort may require a potential offeror, on occasion, to supply newly manufactured major components, i.e. APUs, secondary power systems, and accessories to meet support requirements.  
 
The success of this PBL Power by the Flight Hour concept is based on the contractor’s efforts such as (to name a few), in building a better system, significantly modifying an existing system, improving the logistic support organization, spares optimization, etc. SPCC Market research shows this effort is proprietary to the original equipment manufacturer since the OEM holds the proprietary data and approval process for improvements.  Therefore, this effort is being evaluated for other than full and open competition.

This PBL must comply with 10 U.S.C. 2474 Centers of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE), which authorizes and encourages the head of the CITE to enter into a public-private partnership.  A public-private partnership will be established with the single prime integrator and current organic depots, OO-ALC and NADEP Cherry Point which are located at Hill AFB, Ogden, Utah and MCAS Cherry Point, NC, respectively..  All touch-labor is anticipated to be performed by the Government depots with the support described above provided by the single prime integrator.  It is anticipated that the contractor will be responsible for maintaining and controlling the current inventory of APUs, secondary power systems, accessories, modules, line replaceable units, spares and repair parts.   Historically, labor has been accomplished on repair bridge contracts when the workload transferred from SA-ALC to OO-ALC.  10 U.S.C. 2466, stipulates DoD must maintain a core logistics capability that is Government-owned and Government-operated.  Therefore the workload previously performed under repair bridge-contracts will be performed by the OO-ALC Depot or as determined by an approved Source of Repair Approval Process (SORAP). 

Responses to this announcement shall include the following1) Detailed descriptions of capability and experience in PBL Power by the Flight Hour for APUs, secondary power systems, and accessories for all aircraft listed above and address experience in making significant improvements to the end item(s); 2) Current or previous contracts on PBL Power by the Flight Hour for APUs, secondary power systems, and accessories or similar; 3) Impediments or unique issues that would apply to support at the end item level; and 4) Business size and percentage goals for small businesses. Please do not send brochures or other marketing information.  Responses must be submitted in accordance with this synopsis and shall be limited to 10 pages.  Responses to this announcement are to be submitted to Justen Bonham, OO-ALC/OBS SPCC, phone (801) 586-7286, Justen.bonham@hill.af.mil and must be received no later than 06 December 05.

<DESC>INTERMITTENT CONTRACTOR/SUBJECT-MATTER EXPERT (SME). Background:  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs in various countries throughout the world which address the entire range of customs and border control operations. To effectively implement these programs, there is a need for the utilization of contractors on an intermittent (short-term) basis. Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 days or less. Intermittent Contractors (ICs) will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of a specific contract.  
	
TRAINING: The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter. He/she may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. Instruction may include, but is not limited to, the areas of narcotics interdiction, port security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation. In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.

COURSE DEVELOPER: The IC shall develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors. Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control-related areas such as those described for "Training" above. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.

ASSESSMENTS: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs administrations and other border control agencies located in foreign countries. Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction or intellectual property rights, etc.). Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills to complete an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs, and to prepare trip reports, summaries, analyses and recommendations.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, and/or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.

AUGMENTATION and REPLACEMENT:  The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member. As an additional team member, the IC will undertake general or specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of personnel policies. As a replacement or “fill-in”, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional team member, or replacement member.

TERMS and CONDITIONS: Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice prior to deployment. Some IC assignments may last up to 180 calendar days. It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 180 days in a calendar year. If an IC declines more than two assignments, he or she may be excluded from further consideration at CBP’s discretion.  

POSSIBLE DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP conducts operations. CBP training and assistance projects are currently ongoing in all regions of the world.

COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: 1) ICs will be compensated for their performance on a fixed-priced basis at the rate of $2,400 per week for all ICs or prorating thereof (i.e., $480.00/day, $60.00/hour), for the period of time estimated by CBP for completion of the assignment, excluding travel days. 2) The IC contract will include reimbursement for the IC’s medical evacuation covera, not to exceed $500, and medical examination costs up to $500. 3) All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders (separate and apart from the contract) and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations.  
	
NOTE: ICs will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel. ICs are authorized to receive an advance for expenses for lodging, meals and/or travel incidentals.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS: 1) Prospective ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a “secret” security clearance from CBP. If for some reason a clearance cannot be granted, the prospective IC may be excluded from consideration from any assignments calling for such clearances. 2) For some specific assignments, foreign language ability may be a requirement for selection. 3) All materials provided to or developed by the IC under a contract are the property of CBP, may not be released to any other party without express permission from CBP, and are subject to return to CBP upon conclusion of the contract or otherwise upon receipt of a request from CBP.

CONSIDERATION of APPLICANTS: Interested individuals are to submit their qualifications in resume format, to be accompanied by a completed relating 2-page questionnaire which is also available at www.fbo.gov. In order to ensure that full consideration is given, applicants are encouraged to review the information covered/requested of government job applicants in the form OF-612 (viewable at http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/of612.pdf) and to ensure that the resume submitted to CBP for consideration contains the same data elements that appear in that form. 
Resume packages (i.e., resume & completed questionnaire) will be accepted by e-mail only - Submit to CBP.IC@dhs.gov. No acknowledgement will be made by CBP upon receipt of the resume. Please, no phone calls. 

NOTE: Applicants who applied previously are to submit new application packages in accordance with the guidance and requirements herein, to include a completed questionnaire.

METHOD of SELECTION/OPERATION: CBP’s Office of International Affairs will evaluate the resume and questionnaire packages received for technical ability. CBP may exclude any applicant from consideration if it is unable to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of that applicant’s qualifications from the documents submitted. Qualified and otherwise acceptable candidates will then be added to a “qualified bidders list” from which ICs are selected and awarded a contract for one or more assignments in the future. “Prospective” ICs must be physically fit, able to perform the duties of an assignment and may be required to obtain a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 180 calendar days. If selected for a contract award and CBP elects to require that the prospective IC obtain a physical, CBP will reimburse the IC for reasonable “actual” costs (not to exceed $500) by including this item on the contract, as described above. ICs may be required to obtain emergency evacuation insurance coverage. If so, the contract document will provide for reimbursement of reasonable “actual” costs for this coverage (not to exceed $500).

CONTRACT DOCUMENT: As indicated above, once CBP identifies a requirement and selects a prospective IC, a CBP Contracting Officer will prepare a suitable contract document in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR – viewable at http://www.acqnet.gov/far/). The contract document will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country/destination, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and any required materials. Prospective ICs must be registered in the government’s Central Contractor Registration system at www.ccr.gov prior to issuance of a contract and are not to commence performance or initiate travel until they receive and accept the contract in writing. The duration of contract performance shown on the contract document and resulting dollar amount constitutes a ceiling, beyond which the IC performs at his/her own risk. If needs arise which call for the IC to provide services for an additional period of time, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification which provides authorization for continued performance within specified limits.

CONTRACT INVOICING and PAYMENTS: Payments are processed by CBP in arrears, in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by FAR clause 52.232-25. ICs are to submit an invoice for services rendered under their contract no more frequently than once per month (in arrears), unless otherwise specifically authorized in the contract document. It is suggested that ICs submit their monthly invoice during the first week of each calendar month for services performed during the previous calendar month. IC monthly invoices must comply with the requirements of FAR 32.905. Travel-related reimbursements are handled separately in accordance with applicable travel regulations as indicated in the text above.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS: All taxes (federal, state and/or local) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income reporting requirements are the responsibility of the IC as a “1099” vendor.  

NOTE: This announcement is not an offer of employment. This Notice is being published on an annual basis and supersedes previous notices for CBP’s intermittent contractors. This Notice remains in affect until canceled or superseded. Applicants must realize that CBP’s requirements for the services described above occur on a sporadic basis and there is no assurance or guarantee that they will receive a contract for the services described herein.

<CONTACT>MATTHEW LUTES, 011496214873396
<DESC>Sources are sought who can provide Battle Command (BC) System Support to the United States Army, Europe. The US Army is in the midst of a significant transformational process to reshape its structure and capabilities while conducting GWOT and stabili ty operations within the spectrum of conflict.  USAREUR will transform from its current force structure to an end-state as a lean, agile, joint capable, strategically forward-positioned Army Service Component Command Unit of Employment (UEy) of the United States European Command (EUCOM).  The land component must execute assigned tasks under US Title X to plan, organize, train, equip, and then commit forces per Combatant Command (COCOM) directives.  The execution of command and control responsibilities is pe rformed through battle command or C2 systems.  The battle command and legacy C2 systems utilized by USAREUR are influenced by many factors.  In addition to standard Armywide command and control systems, USAREUR has through necessity developed applications  and systems to meet theater unique requirements to bridge shortcomings in Army-wide systems, interoperability with Joint or Service systems or integration with multinational (e.g. NATO) or coalition commands.  Advances in technology, realignments within p ost-cold war political alliances and the restructuring of the Army in Europe in accordance with transformation campaign guidelines underscore the challenge with maintaining relevant, reliable, and ready battle command systems to perform USAREUR battle comm and functions.   This challenge has required the USAREUR, ODCS G3 to maintain a resident capability to effect this change in the evolution of legacy command and control and newer battle command systems.  An integral element of that reshaping will be in the  continued digitization and modernization of command and control processes and battle command systems within the ground force during its transformation to the UEy construct.  USAREUR is highly engaged in shaping the application of ongoing Army Force XXI di gitization concepts and technology while it maintains the most active operational tempo of any major command in the Army.  USAREUR is directly linked to the Army Future Force that will be a strategically responsive, campaign quality force, dominant across the range of military operations and fully integrated within the joint, interagency, and multinational security framework.

<SUBJECT>Advanced Skirt Technology (skirt, seals, fingers, etc.) for current Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) and Sea Base-to-Shore Connector (SSC) craft that may employ an air cushion system
<DESC>N61331 BAA 06-01:  ADVANCED SKIRT TECHNOLOGY Introduction: This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued. Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) will not issue paper copies of this announcement.  NSWC PC reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  NSWC PC reserves the right to fund all, some or none of the proposals received under this BAA.  NSWC PC provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of NSWC PC to treat all proposals as sensitive, competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Background: This program supports one of the Seabasing Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) programs, High-Speed Sea Base-to-Shore Connector Technologies (HSSBSC), managed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).  One area of interest in this FNC program is the enhanced Sea State capability of the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) and the Sea Base-to-Shore Connector (SSC).  The earliest LCACs will reach the end of their 30-year service life beginning in 2014.  The LCAC replacement, the SSC, is in the initial stages.  Since the Seabasing Capability Based Assessment is still under development, a spiral development approach may be needed to accommodate this timeline.  The SSC will be similar in width to the present LCAC and operated from the legacy amphibious fleet while the length may vary from existing to 1.5 the current length.  Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) concepts as well as tactical operational experience has dictated that the replacement LCACs have an increased sea state operational c!  apability while still being able to enter/operate/exit an existing amphibious ship’s well deck.  Under this BAA, NSWC-PC is soliciting proposals for advanced skirt technology (skirt, seals, fingers, etc.) for current Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) and SSC craft that may employ an air cushion system.  The cushion must allow the vessel to transport weapons systems, equipment, cargo, and personnel from ship-to-shore and over the beach in up to a significant wave height of 6.2 feet (threshold)/10.6 feet (objective) (SS4/5)*  environment.  In a typical mission, the craft will embark equipment, troops, and/or supplies; launch from amphibious ships (LHA, LHD, LPD-17, etc.); transit at high speed to the beach under assault; transit the surf zone and beach; proceed inland to a suitable offload site; offload rapidly; and return to the amphibious ship for reload and follow-on sorties.  The objective of the advanced skirt is to allow current LCAC and future connector craft the ability to perform Sea Base-to-Shore missions in significant wave height of 6.2 feet (threshold)/10.6 f!  eet (objective) (SS4/5) while still being compatible with legacy amphibious ships whose well decks were designed to accommodate craft up to the height and width of a current LCAC on cushion (49 ft wide and up to 25’-10” high).  This will require advances in skirt technology, as the LCAC was designed to be capable of performing ship-to-shore missions only up to sea state 3.  One possible concept for increasing sea state capability while maintaining well deck compatibility is a variable geometry skirt that will enable the craft to enter/operate/exit the well deck in one configuration and to use a different configuration for at-sea operation and beach landing. Program Plan: Three phases of development are envisioned for the advanced skirt technology.  Phase I is the base phase with the government’s option to award Phase II and Phase III.  The first phase of the program would consist of multiple awards requiring the following tasks: advanced skirt preliminary designs, trade study, feasibility study, full-scale skirt material selection and evaluation, operational design parameters for the variable geometry, and computer simulations of vehicle motion, air cushion pressures and flow, material static and dynamic loads, and craft performance and drag.  Phase I will also require 2-dimensional model testing to be conducted at the vendor’s facilities.  The 2-dimensional testing will be a 1/5 model-scale athwartship section of the skirt, including both the port and starboard sides.  The section will be inflated on a model hull section that is unconstrained in the vertical direction and operates over a static solid and water surface.  These tests will ver!  ify and demonstrate the variable geometry functioning of the skirt, using variable lift airflow, mechanical retraction, or whatever other means the design concept will employ in order to operate in the well deck. The tests will also verify the inflated skirt balance and stability and provide an opportunity for design refinements before incorporation into a complete 3-dimensional skirt system.  Phase I is anticipated to last for 7 months. The government has the option and anticipates selection of the two or three most promising concepts and award Phase II contracts.  The Phase II effort will develop the advanced skirt concept from the previous phase into a 3-dimensional design and construct a sub-scale skirt that will be tested on an appropriate tow tank test model identified by the government.  A sub-scale skirt scalable to the existing LCAC will be constructed, and a skirt scalable to 1.5 times that of the existing LCAC may also be required (depending on the results of the analysis from Phase I).  The government will select an appropriate test facility (or facilities) and conduct head-to-head tow tank and possible surf zone testing of the competing designs with contractor involvement.  Phase II is anticipated to last for 8 months.  It is anticipated that the government would then select one or two Phase III awards for full-scale prototype design and fabrication of an advanced skirt system for installation on an existing LCAC (or LCACs).  The contractor will also be required to install skirt system on existing LCAC (with assistance from NSWC-PC) at an appropriate facility and assist the government in testing.  Phase III is anticipated to have a period of performance of 9 months. Under this solicitation, the government requires a detailed cost proposal for Phase I, along with rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates for Phases II and Phase III.  The deliverables for Phase I and II will include a firm price cost proposal for the subsequent phase. As part of the Phase I and Phase II design process, the government will require the awardees to demonstrate/calculate how the prototype could be scaled up from the existing LCAC length to a length up to 1.5 times that of the current LCAC. Desired capabilities of the Advanced Skirt System: The following is a list of requirements and the desired thresholds/objectives for the Advanced Skirt design: Requirements List: 1.	The skirt system must allow the LCAC to enter/operate/exit Navy Amphibious Ship Well Decks (L-Class Ships).  In well deck entry/exit mode skirt maximum on–cushion width would be 49 ft, and the maximum length would not substantially exceed the current Deep Skirt length of 91’-9”; LCAC maximum height with skirt would be 25’-10” threshold and 24’-4” objective. 2.	Advanced Skirt must be compatible with current Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) and be scalable to a vessel up to 1.5 times the length of the current LCAC (i.e. approximately 138 ft). 3.	Advanced skirt outer attachment points will be the same as the current LCAC.  Inner skirt attachment points have the potential for relocation.  4.	Advanced skirt system will utilize current LCAC lift fans and ducting: For information, each of the four double-discharge, double width, double inlet (DWDI) lift fans of the existing LCAC were designed to produce static pressure of 165 psf gauge at a nominal lift air flow rate of 2028 cfs, at design point ambient conditions of standard atmospheric pressure and air temperature of 80oF.   5.	Advanced skirt to be capable of wet well emergency LCAC recovery with the ship ballasted to 5 ft of water at the well deck sill, without the skirt snagging or catching on ship structure or otherwise impeding recovery. Thresholds/Objectives: Notional Requirements:  Sea State Capability(at approx 35 kts) Threshold:  SS4 (Significant WaveHeight 6.2 ft) Objectives:  SS5(Significant Wave Height10.6 ft) 								Application and Submission Information: Proposals shall consist of two separately bound volumes; Volume I shall provide the technical proposal and management approach and Volume II shall address cost. Volume I length is limited to 35 pages exclusive of the Statement of Work (section G, below) which is limited to 20 pages.  Pages are to be 8.5 x 11 inch, single-sided with 12-point font size.

Backup documentation should be submitted to support proposed costs; and  (G)	Fee/Profit, including fee percentage.  Evaluation Information: Per FAR 35.016(e), evaluation of proposals will be based on the following criteria:  (A)	The overall scientific and technical merit of the proposed approach,  (B)	The offeror's capabilities, related experience, experience of the key personnel who are critical to program success, facilities and/or techniques that are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives,  (C)	The realism of estimated costs and schedules and the potential affordability impact on the Navy, including total ownership costs if applicable, and  (D)	Past performance.  These criteria are in descending order of importance for evaluation purposes with technical merit significantly more important than the other evaluation criteria. Proposals will be evaluated using a scientific review process performed by an evaluation team of Government experts drawn from the Navy, Office of Naval Research and other Government agencies as necessary. Evaluation criteria for the three phases will be developed prior to the awarding of each phase.  In general, the phases will be evaluated based on feasibility, potential performance, risk, complexity, maintenance issues, and cost. Proposals are to be submitted by 1500 on 01/20/2006. Proposals submitted after that date may be evaluated by the Government but will be considered to be of less priority for funding. Note:  Contractors will be required to submit a second, more detailed Phase II and Phase III cost proposal as a deliverable of Phase I and Phase II respectively.  However, only contractors who were awarded a Phase I contract will be considered for Phase II and only those awarded a Phase II contract will be considered for Phase III. The Government reserves the right to select for funding any, all, part or none of the responses received. For efforts funded as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  This is to notify potential offerors that each contract that may be placed under this announcement, or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause:  “As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) an entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to!   directory information pertaining to students.  If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative payments unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.” If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any contract, including any existing contract, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a contract or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation." See instructions above for pre-proposals and proposals. The Government’s preference is to award definitive contracts under this BAA. However, an award can be made via grant at the sole discretion of the Government.  All responsive sources may submit proposals that will be considered by NSWC PC. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete and severable areas of submarine escape, rescue, and diving for exclusive competition among these entities.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2) (i).  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Technical content questions should be addressed to Mr. John Ducote. Interested parties are invited to respond to this synopsis. All responsible parties will be considered.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) Program Schedule
<DESC>This notice is to inform Industry that the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, MD desires to continue its exchanges with industry in its planning of the JPALS Acquisition Strategy for System Development and Demonstration (SDD).  JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)-based precision approach and landing system (on land and at sea) that enables military aircraft to safely execute approaches to landing when ceiling and visibility are limiting factors.  JPALS is a Joint Program with the Navy, Air Force and Army as its participants.  Enabling technologies include Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) with an anti-jam capability, a Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) UHF Data Link, and INS (Sea Based only).  The JPALS program requirements also include civil interoperability for all airborne platforms and land based installations. 

A draft RFP for a competitive, performance-based specification was scheduled for release in December 2005 with the final RFP being released in February 2006 for the JPALS SDD effort.  The anticipated contract award via Best Value source selection was scheduled for July 2006.  With regards to recent technology development issues, the JPALS Program schedule is being revised which includes postponing the release of the draft and final RFPs.  While significant progress has been made, several technical focus areas have been evaluated to require additional demonstrated technological maturity prior to entering the SDD phase.  These technical areas are:  a) Ability to estimate GPS carrier phase and pseudorange errors under jamming conditions in order to detect and report hazardously misleading information within a specified time (integrity), b) ability to correct for GPS antenna element bias errors, c) ability to resolve GPS carrier phase cycle ambiguities , d) ability for the GPS reference receiver system to receive and provide data to the JPALS system under clear air and jamming conditions.  The JPALS Program requests Industry provide feedback on these technical focus areas.  Specifically, the Government wishes to know the availability of solutions to the technical areas, testing and test results in the technical areas and perceived risks in developing solutions to the technical areas.   

Other comments and suggestions regarding the Government's course of action and/or alternatives are encouraged and appreciated.  It is requested all written responses and comments be received no later than 4:00 PM on 16 December 2005.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are a small business (S), a small disadvantaged business (SDB), an 8(a) firm, or a large business (L). 

An update to the JPALS Program schedule and its strategy identifying the planned course of action will be provided in early December 2005.  Interested parties should periodically check the PMA-213 web site, https://home.navair.navy.mil/pma213/jpals_industry, for this information and other updated information on JPALS.  Industry members are encouraged to respond to these questions and provide additional/alternative inputs.

Responses and inquiries should be e-mailed to the attention of the Contracting Officer, Lynda Frattone - lynda.frattone@navy.mil, AIR-2.2.1.3, telephone (301) 757 5936.

<SUBJECT>A -- SN06-09 - Proposers' Day for Underwater Express Program
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) will host a Proposers’ Day in support of the Underwater Express program on December 16, 2005 at the Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600, Arlington, VA  22201.  The event will begin at 8:00 am and continue until 3:00 pm.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the program, promote additional discussion on associated topics, and address questions from potential proposers. 

The objective of the Underwater Express program is to demonstrate stable and controllable high-speed underwater transport through supercavitation.  The intent is to determine the feasibility for supercavitation technology to enable a new class of high-speed underwater craft for future littoral missions that could involve the transport of high-value cargo and/or small units of personnel.  The Underwater Express program is a technology development and demonstration program:  It will require the investigation and resolution of critical technological issues associated with the physics of supercavitation and must culminate in a credible demonstration at a significant scale to prove that a supercavitating underwater craft is controllable at speeds up to 100 knots.

It is anticipated that DARPA will release a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Underwater Express program prior to the Proposers’ Day.  The BAA will encourage proposals that advance the understanding and use of supercavitation technology through research and development, small-scale experimentation, and a final at-sea demonstration.  The program will include (but is not limited to) the following technology areas:  cavitation and supercavitation, cavity ventilation, vehicle control, underwater propulsion, computational modeling, and vehicle system integration.  Additionally, potential proposers are invited to use the Proposers' Day to discuss their organization's capabilities and explore teaming arrangements with other attendees.

<SUBJECT>--This Request for Information is issued on behalf of the Government to create a Qualified Products List (QPL) for individual and collective protection filters.
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMAITON: Filter Materials and End Items The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI) or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. This Request for Information is issued on behalf of the Joint Project Management Office for Individual Protection (JPMO-IP), the Joint Project Management Office for Collective Protection (JPMO-CP), and the Engineering Directorates Individual and Collectiv e Protection Business Unit (ICPBU) at the Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (ECBC).  The ICPBU is seeking responsible sources to provide, at no cost to the Government, technical information for market research purposes.  Individual responses to this Request for Information that may contain company proprietary information must be marked accordingly.  Such information will not be released outside the Government.  This Market Research shall not be construed as a request for proposal.  The Government does  not intend to award a contract from the results of this RFI.  The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any technical information identified (e.g., limited and/or restricted rights).  Interested firms may submit techn ical papers, submit questions and provide company information at the following Internet web address: http://www.ecbc.army.mil/ps/fasq.htm no later than December 17, 2005 at 4:00 pm EST.  No telephonic submissions will be honored.  The Internet web address will be fully operational no later than 18 November 2005. Description:  The ICPBU is the lead organization for a two-year initiative to create a Qualified Products List (QPL) for individual and collective protection filters.  This qualification effort is full and open to all candidates, regardless of the origin o f its components.  However, prior to being placed on a QPL, candidates must mitigate all risk of interruption in supply.  The effort will evaluate the performance characteristics of candidate filter materials and end items configured to the military filter  requirements.  The qualification will be conducted in three phases, as follows: Phase I includes announcement of the RFI, an Industry Day and coordination among government, industry, and academia; Phase II encompasses all the testing in the form of gates.   Phase III will consist of analysis and service review by the Government. Specific information relating to the proposed Industry Day will be provided in a future FedBizOpps.gov announcement. Phase II testing consists of four gates of tests.  The regimen of testing performed on a candidate material depends on its maturity.  Each gate consists of multiple, physical, reactive, interoperability, and environmental tests.  Gate 1 will require sample s of physical (particulate) filtration materials/reactive (chemical) filtration materials/filter housing designs from each supplier for the testing.  Items will be tested for all or part of the following; particulate pressure drop, adsorbent pressure drop,  particulate filtration of polyalphaolefin and adsorbent filtration of cyanogen chloride (CK), hydrogen cyanide (AC), phosgene (CG) and dimethylmethylphosphonate (DMMP) gas life testing.  Successful samples shall have performance equal to or greater than c omponents of filters currently used.  Gate 2 testing will consist of breakthrough testing using toxic industrial chemicals, ethylene oxide (EO) at National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conditions, ammonia at the Joint Service General  Purpose Mask (JSGPM) conditions and possibly emerging filtration requirements.  Gate 3 will include selected chemical breakthrough testing of end items after environmental exposures.  Gate 4 will consist of Operational Testing using assembled filters.  Du ring an Operational Test, assembled filters will be tested by a target user for such characteristics as comfort, ease of use, and protection factor testing.  Upon successful passing of appropriat e Gates results for qualifying materials or end items will be analyzed and reviewed for inclusion on a QPL. Interested parties are not necessarily required to supply end items or pass all gates to be considered for the QPL.  Candidates may qualify their products for the QPL as, but not limited to, particulate media, adsorbent media, or an assembled filter. Addit ional information relating to the testing protocols will be made available to the offerors.

II.  Description of Supply/Service One-seat license for VMetric-XL software, and one year of software  maintenance.  VMetric-XL is a state-of-the, proprietary software for  managing inventory and determining stock levels at multiple locations in  support of weapon system readiness goals, and it can only be acquired from  the TFD Group.  Its essential/salient features are:             (1) Applies DOD inventory policies             (2) Database and GUI interface             (3) Models unlimited echelons of supply/repair, indenture  levels and number of items             (4) Data may vary by item and site (e.g., demand rates,  order/ship times, criticalities, etc             (5) End-item mix may vary by site             (6) Multiple targets for optimization, including,  availability, cost, fill rate, availability by  site, availability/cost slope, and delay per demand             (7) Determines optimal order quantities and reorder points             (8) Considers cost, weight and volume of components             (9) Models redundancy and criticality of items             (10) Evaluates impact of cannibalization and lateral supply III.  Applicability of Authority VMetric-XL software is the only product that can satisfy the Government’s  requirement.  It is unique in that it applies DOD inventory policies, and  can model the complexity of the Air Force supply system and maintenance  structure.  Lockheed-Martin uses it to compute initial spare part  requirements for the Joint Strike Fighter, F-35.  Hqs AFMC/XP has been  tasked to validate Lockheed-Martin’s spare part requirements calculations.  Consequently, it must use the exact same software product that  Lockheed-Martin uses to insure the accuracy of the data and calculations  which will affect millions of dollars worth of F-35 component inventory. IV.  Market Research Similar products—Aircraft Sustainability Model (Logistics Management,  Inc.), Aircraft Availability Model (Logistics Management Institute),  Dyna-METRIC (Rand Corp), SESAME (developed/used by US Army), and ARROWS  (developed/used by US Navy)—also perform marginal analysis in order to  compute inventory stock levels, but they do not permit users to specify  unique transportation times for bases, or to compute the least cost stock  solution across all bases and depots. V.  Efforts to Obtain Competition Proposed contract action will be synopsized, and a copy of this brand name  justification will be included in the synopsis.

1	GENERAL.

1.1	Background:  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) operates 85 ground based Differential Global Positioning (DGPS) Radio Frequency (RF) Medium Frequency (MF) broadcast sites, transmitting a Medium Shift Keyed (MSK) signal in the 285KHz through 325 KHz frequency range, throughout the Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  All of these DGPS broadcast sites emit RF energy that can be harmful to the human body if enough RF radiation is absorbed.  The USCG is reviewing its Radiation Hazard (RADHAZ) instruction, Commandant Instruction Manual (CIM) 10550.25A, Chapter 4.1.10 to more accurately reflect best practices recommended by industry from emerging technology.  One DGPS site has been carefully surveyed, and other configurations exist which must be surveyed using similar equipment and techniques.  The USCG requires seven sites to be accurately surveyed to advise technicians of existing RADHAZ conditions.  Following each site survey, the contractor will provide a written report recommended safe distances, including site diagrams.  The report must describe the hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Fuel (HERF), Ordnance (HERO) and, Personnel (HERP) The contractor will summarize all findings of the surveys during an oral presentation at C2CEN.

There are six serial numbers on your current contract that I do not see
listed in the Solicitation.  Do you want these items deleted from the
renewed Smartnet contract?  The serial numbers are:  FOX0604022B,
72620415, 250785287, TBA05410546, FOX5360G72, SCA0440AX.  


You have a serial number listed on the solicitation as SCA044404AX
WS-C6509.  However,  you have a serial number on your Smartnet contract
as SCA0440AX  WS-C6509.  Could this serial number be the same number
just missing some numbers on it?



There are 90 items for the requirement this year.....Also, TBA05410546 is on line 0012....FOX0604022B, correct serial # is FOX0604002B on Line # 0009.....

<DESC>I apoligize for the inconvenience but it has now came to the government's attention that the current conract does not expire until 19 November 2005 therefore the period of performance has now changed to 20 November 2005 through 30 September 2006.  

Another change is that the current contract is actually $131,595.62

<DESC>This is Amendment P00001 to RFQ# HSTS0306QCOM001 to provide answers to questions about this RFQ.******************************************************************************************************************************Technical Questions:

##1.	The SOW states that travel outside the Washington D.C. area is not anticipated. Does that mean that you expect the contractor to be in the Washington D.C. area? My company is located in Utah. Can we perform the work from here?

The contractor can perform anywhere within the US, however, we expect that a representative from the company come to TSA HQ on an AS NEEDED basis to train our HQ employees.  I do not expect we would need to hold training sessions more than one initially and perhaps a refresher every 4-6 months.

##2.	The bid show a system for 15 concurrent users.  I wanted to make sure that was correct since the system TSA is currently using is a 25 seat system. Is 15 correct?

Approximately 15 users is correct.  We have about 5 people at HQ who use it, plus about 10 in the field around the country.

##3.	With respect to the above referenced solicitation, it is unclear to me from the statement of work whether the agency is looking for a contractor to build and provide a public relations system or if the agency is seeking quotes for subscribing to a pre-existing service.  Can you please clarify this for me?

TSA is seeking quotes for subscribing to pre-existing services.*************************************************************************************************************************Contracting Questions:

##1.	We currently are NOT a GSA Schedule Holder; will that essentially eliminate us from competing for this opportunity?

Yes, companies that are not GSA Schedule Holders and small businesses will not be considered for award.  This procurement is open to GSA Schedule Holders with a contract under the Federal Supply Schedule 70 – General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services, Electronic Commerce Services (132-33).

##2.	We have an IDIQ GWAC from DOI-NBC that has a government approved rate schedule; I am not sure, if that can be used, please advice?

This procurement will be conducted under the Federal Supply Schedule 70 – General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services, Electronic Commerce Services (132-33) offered by the General Services Administration.  Other GWACs will not be utilized.

##3.	So only small businesses who have a GSA schedule may submit a quote?

Yes, see answers for questions 2 and 3.

##4.	If you do need a GSA schedule holder, then can we team with other company, who is a GSA scheduler holder?

If companies wish to have teaming arrangements, all team members within a specific teaming arrangement have to have a GSA Schedule Contract.  Subcontracting with the company that receives the award is allowed.

##5.	Is there an incumbent who has been performing this task? If so, can you provide me with the contractor's name, contract number, contract type, award date, duration including option years and total value? I would appreciate any information you are able to provide.

This information cannot be provided at this time.  Vendors may submit a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to TSA to obtain this information.  Please contact Ms. Catrina Pavlik at 571-227-2499 or Catrina.Pavlik@dhs.gov to request this information.


##6.	Is the date of the award scheduled for around 1/15/06?  I wasn't sure if the Archive date was the date of the award.

The date of the award is estimated to happen by the end of December 2005 or January 2006.  The archive date is just the date the document will be archived in the system (www.fedbizopps.gov).

##7.	The current system TSA is using expires 11/30.  Am I to assume that TSA will not have access to any system until the award is made?

This is correct.

##8.	We also want to know which countries will be eligible to participate in this tender?

Due to Buy American Act provisions and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the countries that can participate in this effort are Canada and Mexico.

##9.	The RFQ requests quoters to provide their GSA contract number and expiration date.  See RFQ at 5.  Please clarify this ambiguity.

The GSA contract number is requested to verify the validity of the contract.  The expiration date is requested to confirm that the contract will be active during the performance of the contract for base year and any options.

##10.	We are interested in preparing a quote in response to this RFQ and want to know whether we would be considered eligible for award and the basis for such eligibility since the RFQ, as issued, states otherwise.

Vendors must be GSA Schedule Holders and small business to be considered for award.  Just like FAR 8, the Acquisition Management System (AMS) allows TSA to purchase commodities or services through the Federal Supply Schedule Program (FSS) or the Multiple Award Schedule Program (MAS).  In addition, AMS and TSA policies mandate to set-aside any procurement under $200K.

##11.	Please confirm whether or not this procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12 and whether the Government will award a fixed-price purchase order using Simplified Acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR 13.5.

This procurement will be conducted utilizing Ordering Procedures for Federal Supply Schedules.  This is FAR 8.  However, TSA abides by the Acquisition Management Systems (AMS), and not the FAR.  Please see the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), Public Law 107–71, which stipulates that “The acquisition management system established by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under section 40110 shall apply to acquisitions of equipment, supplies, and materials by the Transportation Security Administration.”

http://www.tsa.gov/interweb/assetlibrary/Aviation_and_Transportation_Security_Act_ATSA_Public_Law_107_1771.pdf

##12.	There is no NAICS code designated in the RFQ that you emailed to us.

The NAICs Code was included in the synopsis posted on the Government Point of Entry (www.fedbizopps.gov).  For your reference, the NAICs Code is 511210 - SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS.  The small business size standard is $21,000,000.***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
