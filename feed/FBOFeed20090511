<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Wildlife Services (WS) intends to negotiate and award, a contract to EM Heli-Logistics LTD, located in Langley, BC¸ Canada.  The proposed contract action is to disassemble, inspect and repair a MD500 helicopter.   The helicopter suffered severe damage which required complete rebuilding of the airframe and installation of a factory new engine. After 100 hours time in service it was discovered certain time life components had incomplete tracking of times in use and some airframe repairs are in question as to compliance to manufactures recommendations. At the FAA’s request, the airworthiness certificate was surrendered to the FAA, thus rendering the helicopter inoperable. To regain the airworthiness certificate it is necessary to completely disassemble the helicopter, inspect airframe repairs and replace time life components in question. A #2 station MD 500 airframe alignment jig fixture is required to be used during this process to maintain fuselage alignment. Any attempt to disassemble the fuselage and reassemble the fuselage without the use of a #2 alignment fixture will render the helicopter unusable. Heli-logistics located in B.C. Canada is the only MD Helicopter Factory Authorized Helicopter Airframe Repair Facility worldwide other than the MD Helicopter factory which has in their possession a #2 station alignment jig fixture.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and ability by responding with a capability statement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   However, information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The determination to compete the action is solely the discretion of the Government.  Any questions or inquiries must be mailed, e-mailed or faxed to the attention of the point of contact listed in this notice.  Requests by telephone will not be honored.

<DESC>PROJECT DETAILS: This project provides pavement preservation for all or most roads in Lava Beds National Monument, Redwood National Park and Whiskeytown National Recreation Area. These Parks are located in Northern California in the Counties of Siskiyou, Del Norte, Humboldt and Shasta. These Parks extend from the Coastal Ranges through the Klamath Mountains to the Modoc Plateau. This provides a project with diverse terrain and climates. The project is essentially bounded by the Cities of Redding, CA, Crescent City, CA and Klamath Falls, OR.

<DESC>PROJECT DETAILS:  The project is located approximately 60 miles (97 km) northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada in Lake Mead National Recreation Area. The proposed project will rehabilitate 17.5 miles (28.2 km) of Northshore Road between mileposts 27.3 to 47.6. The route is entirely within the Lake Mead NRA. Project work includes rehabilitation, restoration, spot reconstruction (3.3 m (5.3 km)), and resurfacing of the existing roadway, parking areas, and pullouts. Roadway rehabilitation consists of widening the roadway using aggregate base to achieve the design width; pulverizing the existing asphalt pavement and aggregate base; placing of aggregate base to correct superelevation and crown; and resurfacing with hot asphalt concrete pavement. Roadway reconstruction is identified in areas where existing roadway deficiencies are excessive and can not be corrected with rehabilitation. This work includes removing the existing pavement; minor excavation and embankment to construct the subgrade; placing of aggregate base; and resurfacing with hot asphalt concrete pavement. In addition, project work includes the removal of inferior subgrade material (sub-excavation), drainage improvements (culvert/drop inlet installations and extensions, cleaning culverts, headwall construction, concrete curb and gutter construction, and riprap installation); reinforced concrete low water crossing construction, temporary tortoise fence, historic masonry work, and other incidentals. Masonry work includes reconstruction of historic stone headwalls that need to be dismantled and reconstructed. The roadway is currently open to public traffic and will remain open during construction with short delays. The construction will be completed in three segments. The contract will require paving of one segment before pavement is removed or pulverized on another section. The work is anticipated to take between 6 to 12 months starting in August 2009.  When the solicitation is issued, contractors will be required to price bid items and bid the number of calendar days they will take to construct the project.

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORKFOR2009 ARCHEOLOGICAL CATALOGING PROJECTATINDEPENDENCE NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK

Project DescriptionThis project will contract for archeological cataloging services to produce standardized museum catalog records for an estimated 20000 archeological specimens associated with the excavation of historic areas in Independence National Historical Park, a unit of the National Park Service.  These areas include 18th and early 19th century domestic and public sites within the city of Philadelphia PA.  The excavation of these sites is documented in a variety of ways, including field notes, site reports, object inventories, and site drawings.  This documentary material will be provided to the contractor for use in preparing the catalog records.

Task OrderThe contractor will catalog all of the estimated 20000 archeological specimens according to the National Park Service's Automated National Cataloging System+ standards and produce complete electronic catalog records for these specimens (both individually and lot cataloged).  Electronic versions of all the catalog records will be provided to the park on CD-ROM at the conclusion of the project.

Conduct of the WorkAll the archeological specimens to be cataloged will be transported to the contractor's facility at the contractor's expense.  The contractor will retain the order in which the archeological specimens are currently stored, including those specimens that are bagged as lots.  Within each lot, the specimen with the largest dimensions will be numbered with the catalog number by the contractor.  The contractor will also place an acid-free paper tag showing the catalog number into each bagged lot.  The contractor will use the ANCS+ software to produce the electronic catalog records supplemented by the Independence National Historical Park archeological cataloging manual. At the conclusion of the project, the contractor will return all of the housed archeological specimens (both individually and lot-cataloged) to Independence National Historical Park along with the CD-ROM of all catalog records.
The National Park Service will pay any costs associated with the contractor's mandated use of the ANCS+ software.

<a href="mailto:hoover.deborah@epa.gov">DEBORAH K. HOOVER</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code - 562910 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region 4 requires environmental  soil remediation services at the "former" Tower Chemical Company, Operable Unit (OU) #3 Superfund Site in Clermont, Lake County, Florida.
This requirement is under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  These efforts are subject to additional mandatory FAR clauses, upon promulgation of future Federal Acquisition Circulars (FACs) implementing the ARRA.  Upon promulgation of these clauses, they will be incorporated into the solicitation/contract and made applicable to ARRA funded activities.
The work to be performed consists of excavation of soil, transportation and disposal of waste and soils contaminated with pesticides, dewatering operations, soil backfilling and restoration, re-grading site excavation areas and vegetation restoration and wetland restoration and monitoring.
Approximately five (5) acres of the 15 acre site, including some wetland areas, are impacted and require excavation of approximately 49,850 cubic yards (CY) of soil.  It is estimated that approximately 27,592 CY of contaminated soil is to be excavated and transported to a Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) subtitle D landfill.  An additional 22,251 CY of uncontaminated soil will also require excavation.  There will be optional quantity increments not to exceed 5,000 CY in the event that soil confirmation test results do not meet the clean-up goals specified in the Record of Decision (ROD). 
The procurement for this requirement will be a competitive 8(a) set-aside with incentives for using alternative fuels such as bio-diesel, diesel idle reduction practices and utilization of local businesses and labor.  
The contractor shall be required to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.  The remediation will be conducted pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), and National Contingency Plan (NCP) requirements.
The EPA, Region 4 anticipates issuing a firm-fixed-price contract consisting of a two year performance period, with quantity options and incentives for performance.  The estimated dollar value for this procurment, including all quantity options, if exercised, is in a range  between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The IFB is anticipated to be issued on or about June 1, 2009.
The IFB will be posted at:  www.epa.gov/oam/regions/index.htm

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Chris M. Ganey, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone 301-443-4379, Email CHRISTOPHER.GANEY@PSC.HHS.GOV

Title:  Community Assessment of Rosebud Sioux Tribe Suicide Prevention Initiatives.

Notification of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract.

The Office of Public Health and Science (HHS) intends to award a sole source contract
to  the Aberdeen Tribal Chairmen’s Health Board, Northern Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center (Health Board/ Epi-Center). The Health Board/ Epi-Center  is a non-profit organization tribally sanctioned by the seventeen tribes in the Aberdeen Area. Sanctioned means that all tribes are members of the board and approve board activities as they relate to the work they do with the individual tribal entities or activities that impact the area tribes at large.  

	 The four-state region of the Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service (IHS)  has among the highest suicide rates of any of the 12 IHS Regions in the US.  The Rosebud IHS Service Unit, which provides health services to Rosebud Sioux tribal members, has reported an annual suicide rate of 69 per 100,000 for the past two years. American Indian/Alaska Native youth 15-24 years old commit suicide at rate more than 3 times the national average of 13 per 100,000.
•	Suicide is the second leading cause of death after accidents
•	In the Great Plains area, the suicide rate among Indian youth is 10 times the national average. 
•	Suicide rate on Rosebud Sioux Tribe is 4 times the South Dakota rate  
•	Plains Reservations among the poorest in the country.  

In response to epidemic levels of suicide and attempted suicides on the Rosebud Sioux Tribe Reservation, the RST Suicide Prevention Task Force was created in early 2007 to raise public awareness, mobilize communities to action and educate tribal youth and employees to recognize and respond to suicidal behavior.  Funding from state, federal and private sources has further enabled the development and expansion of programming aimed at reducing suicide and improving the mental health and well-being of tribal members.  
 
The purpose is to assess the extent to which suicide prevention initiatives are influencing the awareness and perception of suicide risk, and access to preventive services in local tribal communities.  The goal is to better understand the larger cultural and social context of responses to the problem of suicide in Rosebud Sioux Tribe reservation communities. 
 The work will involve developing Evaluation Design, developing process and criteria for community assessment of suicide prevention programs and strategies, protocol and survey instruments and tools for Institutional Review Board and/or Office of Management and Budget Approval.  Implementing evaluation protocol and survey and compiling and synthesizing project evaluations.

 The Health Board/ Epi-Center  was formed in 1986 as a response to unified approach to health delivery services capitalizing on the natural alignment of the seventeen tribes in the Aberdeen Area.

 The Healthboard/ Epi-Center has formed strong collaborative links with the Indian Health Service, SAMHSA, CDC, and other agencies to develop, track and remain alert to trends in health. 

 One important function is to serve as an advocate for health needs and issues for tribes in the Aberdeen Area.  Another function is to assist tribes in assessing local health needs and developing, implementing and evaluating interventions. 

 As a tribally operated program, the Healthboard/ Epi-Center has a unique trust relationship with the tribes of the area.  This trust relationship allows Healthboard/ Epi-Center to collaborate with federal and academic entities for Indian-specific health projects to produce a far greater effect than could be achieved by any entity alone.  As the representative of the Indian Tribes in the four state area, they are capable of providing the leadership and organizational skills to plan and implement this evaluation project.   

The Healthboard/ Epi-Center knows and understands the culture and the way of life of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe which will allow for the development and implementation of the project evaluation in a manner that is sensitive and appropriate to the members of the community. As an active member of the Tribal Chairmen’s Health Board, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe relies on the NPTEC to assess the needs of its communities in a manner that takes into account culture, geography, history, belief systems providing solutions and recommendations that fit the needs of the identified communities.   

The Healthboard/ Epi-Center has been providing leadership in suicide prevention training and education.  Due to the sensitivity of the subject matter, the Healthboard/ Epi-Center’s role makes it the best organization to carry out this activity.

Any firm which believes that it may have similar capabilities is encouraged to submit  their capability statement addressing each of the items/areas cited above.  Written capability statements may not exceed five (5) pages and must be received by the contracting officer not later than 3:30pm EDT on May 27, 2009.  

Small Businesses are encouraged to review this notice. 

E-MAIL CAPABILITY STATEMENT TO:  Christopher.Ganey@psc.hhs.gov 

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  No solicitation document is available at this time.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

For further information, contact Chris Ganey at DHHS/PSC/SAS/DAM, Parklawn Building, Room 5-101, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857 or on 301-443-2475.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for planning purposes to identify interested vendors for the requirement detailed below.  A formal solicitation, performance work statement, and technical exhibits are not available for release at this time.  In accordance with FAR 19.5 Set-asides for Small Business, the Government will review the information requested in this email to determine the type of set-aside if any for this requirement.
The U.S. Geological Survey(USGS), Office of International Programs, has a requirement for the establishment of technical training services to be performed in Afghanistan, the United States and other areas as deemed appropriate.  USGS recognizes the potential that Afghanistan's natural resource sector has provided a basis for the economic development of the nation.  Hence, the USGS is conducting resource assessments in Afghanistan to develop a sustainable national capability to continue assessment and monitoring work after the USGS effort has been completed.  The USGS has the technical expertise to conduct much of this training, however it will also require outside assistance in the development of actual training offerings, in the logistical support of trainees, and in the fiduciary reporting requirements attendant to the administration of monies allocated for these training activities.
The custom designed training will provide a broad range of activities such as geological, geotechnical, environmental, biological, policy, and mining disciplines.  The program will focus on developing and strengthening the capabilities of Afghan Nationals to conduct national resource and natural hazards assessments and downstream development activities, specifically with the goal of developing an indigenous capability to support and regulate natural resource development.
Institutional building or training is one of the seven critical components in the proposed activities designed to rebuild the Afghanistan Government.  
The Contractor shall be responsible for detailed design of training activities in consultation with USGS.  The needs and goals of the training activities shall be determined by the Contractor through consultation and coordination with both the USGS and Afghan organizations.  Once programs are approved by USGS, the contractor shall be responsible for implementation.  The custom designed training program will cover a broad range of activities including but not limited to:  geological, geotechnical, environmental, biological, policy and mining disciplines.  The Contractor shall have subcontracting authority, which will enable the firm to retain the services of specialized partners such as academic institutions and subject matter specialists as needed to carry out activities in support of the USGS program.
The Government anticipates award of a commercial IDIQ type contract.  The procurement is anticipated to be a base year with four (4) one-year option periods.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees.
Small Business Concerns who believe they can responsibly perform this requirement should submit the following information no later than 4 pm, May 18, 2009 EST.
1.	Small business status of potential offer (8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.) and point of contact information for potential offeror, cage code, and D&B number.2.

<DESC><p>This Sources Sought Notice is for Market Research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal. The Government will not pay for any information provided in response to this RFI. Responses will be at no cost to the Government.
<p>Summary: Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is looking for capable vendors interested in fulfilling current and future requirements for Land Mobile Radio (LMR) subscriber equipment for the command. The requirement for LMR subscribers is based on providing continuous base level support for infrastructure upgrades and to meet Association of Public/Safety Communications (APCO 25), commonly referred to as Project 25 specifications. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) require all LMR/TLMR radios and infrastructures to meet Project 25 specifications. Project 25 provides interoperability capabilities to support mutual aide and emergency response mission requirements. The LMR subscriber radios are part of the overall radio network/system and provide critical support for Command and Control (C2) communications. A LMR system/infrastructure can consists of a Trunked LMR (TLMR) controller IT servers, radio repeaters, subscribers (radio base stations, mobile and portable radios) and peripheral support items (radio antennas, RF/Power cable, Batteries w/chargers). Radio assets supporting C2 must also support Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with Over-the-Air-Rekey (OTAR) and Over-the-Air-Provisioning (OTAP) capabilities with 100 percent interoperability and functionality with current and future base level LMR/TLMR systems/infrastructure. The current and projected AETC base level infrastructures are Motorola manufactured systems.</p>
<p>The purchased LMR radios will replace older assets that are not capable of operations within a full Project 25 environment and will also provide enhanced systems management capabilities on the base level infrastructures. The OTAR capabilities are needed to support encryption requirements on a large scale for effective security of C2 communications and provide centralized key management capabilities. The OTAP feature provides remote configuration, maintenance of radios and talkgroups. These enhanced management capabilities maximize effectiveness of the LMR/TLMR systems.</p>
<p>The equipment needed is as follows:<br />a. HANDHELD, PORTABLE (LMR) RADIO UHF, 1000 Channel, P25/Digital, SmartZone, AES, OTAR, OTAP, 9600 Baud w/full digital display, navigation keys and full alphanumeric keypad, Frequency Band UHF 380-470 MHZ, w/Battery and Antenna<br />b.

<DESC><p>The Department of Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Department of Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax &amp; Trade Bureau) is conducting market research in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. This request for information (RFI) is being posted to obtain information from vendors with the interest, proven expertise and experience in the application of DNA analysis for varietal authentication of wines. It does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. This is not a request for a proposal.
<p>This notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that the response is not a request that will be considered for contract award. All interested parties will be required to respond to any resultant solicitation separately from their response to this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The information being requested is for planning purposes only. The Government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested. TTB will assess the ability of the market to meet the needs as stated above based on the information received. Upon receipt of the requested information, the Government may request additional information to confirm the respondents' capability. The vendor must identify their business size classification (ex. SDVOSB or HUBZone), as well as, provide any available contract vehicles, such as a GSA Schedule. Dependent upon the results of this market survey and other information obtained by the Government, BPD on behalf of TTB may subsequently issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to acquire the DNA analysis as mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />TTB regulates the alcohol beverage and tobacco products and their industries in the USA, and one of our core missions is to protect the public from consumer deception. The Scientific Services Division (SSD) of TTB is interested in expanding SSD's analytical capabilities to authenticate wine varietals. At our National Laboratory Center, we have been researching methods for varietal authentication of wines for several years. The Beverage Alcohol Lab (BAL) has evaluated three approaches in this effort: (1) Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis of wines, (2) High Pressure Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) analysis of anthocyanins and shikimic acid in wines, and (3) Direct mass spectrometry analyses of the volatile content of four red varietal wines and four white varietal wines. The spectra generated were then analyzed by chemometrics techniques to differentiate between the varietal wines.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong> <br />Each of the approaches that BAL has investigated has presented challenges in our goal to reliably determine varietal authenticity. The FTIR and Mass spectrometric analyses approaches did not work. The anthocyanin and shikimic acid based method has provided limited success in authenticating only four 100% pure varietal wines. However, TTB allows wines to be blended up to 75%, and the method has significant limitations in authenticating blended wines. Besides, one of the challenges of this method is the chemical properties of polyphenolics (anthocyanins) in wine. It is known that anthocyanin concentrations in wine slowly decrease over time and our HPLC method is successful only for red wines with vintages that are no more than five years old. Although we are still optimizing this method, recent improvements in the use of DNA analysis using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify grape cultivars used in commercial wines warrant SSD to consider exploring this technique. We believe that the DNA profiling of wines would be the gold standard for varietal authentication, once the technology is perfected.</p>
<p><strong>The Need to Develop Capabilities for PCR Analysis for Wine</strong></p>
<p>To protect the public and honest industry members from false or misleading labels and to assist wine exporters when varietal designation is challenged by foreign governments, SSD would like to expand its analytical capabilities by developing DNA analysis for varietal authentication of wines. In its simplest terms, PCR is a DNA copying machine that takes very few segments of DNA and makes millions of exact copies. Although the technique was only recently discovered in the 1980's, it is now considered "routine" in the field of microbiology and biotechnology. Some of the applications of DNA marker technologies include forensic science, detection of viruses, bacteria, respiratory tract infections, and identification of bioterrorism agents. PCR analysis has also been used in food authentication research. The authenticity of foods and beverages such as seafood, rice, grapes, grape musts and wine has been investigated using PCR-DNA analysis.</p>
<p>Historically, cultivar identification of wines using DNA biomarker technology was problematic due to the very low level of DNA fragments in processed wines. However, recent advances in the extraction protocol of DNA fragments from wines and the utility of PCR technique have allowed researchers to overcome sensitivity issue in DNA analysis in wines.</p>
<p><strong>Project Goals: </strong></p>
<p>Although DNA analysis is a routine biotechnology technique, the chemists in the Beverage Alcohol Laboratory of SSD have no formal training in DNA analyses or the equipment to perform the extraction and amplification on site. The Government requires a collaborative method development research project with a group (University, research lab, private or public company, etc) with proven expertise and experience in the application of DNA analysis for varietal authentication of wines. The Government's goal from the collaboration is to:</p>
<p>1) Determine the availability of specific DNA primers for eight specific Vitis vinifera varietals (merlot, cabernet sauvignon, zinfandel, pinot noir, riesling, chardonnay and pinot gris). This list may be expanded depending on availability;</p>
<p>2) Develop and validate an assay to Vitis vinifera varietal DNA markers in wine using PCR analysis;</p>
<p>3) Explore the utility of quantitative-PCR (qPCR) to quantitate Vitis vinifera varietal DNA markers in blended wines;</p>
<p>4) Determine the measurement uncertainty and specificity of the DNA assay and determine the feasibility of the technique in enforcing the regulations and statues governing the labeling of wine varietals;</p>
<p>5) Train SSD chemists on the technique of DNA analysis; and</p>
<p>6) Transfer the technology to SSD to enable the routine DNA analysis of wine at TTB.</p>
<p>Vendors are requested to submit the following information for assessment:</p>
<p>&bull; The capability of the vendor to provide the services described above, their business size based on a NAICS code of 621511 which has a size standard of $13.5M, and whether or not the vendor has a GSA schedule or other contractual vehicle that can be used to obtain these types of services.</p>
<p>&bull; A short description of experience in dealing DNA analysis in authenticating table wine varietals.</p>
<p>&bull; A written summary of vendor's past performance as it relates to similar analysis, including the names of three references</p>
<p>&bull; Pricing (ex: labor categories and hourly rates) for these types of services</p>
<p>Dependent upon the results of this market research, Public Debt anticipates issuing a solicitation to acquire these services. Any such solicitation would be based on a performance-based work statement. Please note that no solicitation document is available at this time.</p>
<p>Any questions related to the request for information shall be directed to the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer. No contact shall be made with the TTB staff.</p>
<p>Electronic submissions shall be sent to psb3@bpd.treas.gov no later than June 9, 2009 at 2:00pm EDT. The subject line must contain RFI-TTB-09-0017 BKERN. The following file extensions are not allowable and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered:</p>

The SIR evaluation process may involve face-to-face negotiations with one or more offerors. The intent of these negotiations is for the FAA evaluators, or IPT, to gain a better understanding of the proposed project and/or to clarify evaluation information submitted by the offeror. All offerors that are eliminated from the competition will be notified in writing.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing an ambient or environmentally-controlled atomic force / scanning probe microscope for the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology. It will naturally be employed to investigate a wide range of materials and nanostructures in low-humidity or variable-humidity environments. High-resolution imaging and analysis of surface topography, lateral forces and adhesion will be required. Multiple imaging modes – conductive, contact and non-contact, with setpoint modulation capability and the ability to be modified (at the hardware and software levels) for user-defined modes - are also required. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for an atomic force microscope that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.


NIST has a need for a stand-alone AFM/SPM that would meet the following requirements:

AFM/SPM:
•	This AFM/SPM shall be capable of multiple imaging modes, including force spectroscopy in non-contact and contact modes and force curve mapping.
•	Shall be capable of closed loop scanning.
•	Shall be capable of conductive AFM measurements.
•	Shall be capable of atomic resolution imaging, preferably closed loop for accurate measurements.
•	Shall be capable of supporting at least three electrical leads to the probe.
•	Shall be capable of heating the sample with minimal thermal drift up to 300ºC.
•	Shall be capable of measuring humidity near the sample.
Electronics:
•	Shall be versatile with open schematics (or a strong service/support) record for ease of use and alteration.
•	Shall include access to detected signals with a high detection bandwidth (e.g. 5-10 MHz).
Environmental control:
•	Shall be flushable with dry nitrogen or be compatible with a home-built/custom enclosure for atmospheric control.
•	Shall permit operation of the AFM in a dry or humid environment.
•	Shall exhibit high thermal stability (active thermal stabilization is preferred).
Specimen holders, tip and sample exchange, and imaging stages:
•	Shall include a top-view camera for alignment and video/snapshot recording.
•	Sample holders shall accommodate 1 cm sample sizes are larger.
Microscope control software:
•	Shall be fully integrated and capable of controlling the functions of the microscope and detectors in a user-friendly fashion.
•	Shall consist of IgorPro user-programmable scripts and functions.
Data analysis software:
•	Shall include quantitative data analysis software using the most common data analysis algorithms. 
•	Shall be user-programmable.

AFM – atomic force microscope(y)
SPM – scanning probe microscope(y)

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company’s size classification in any response to this notice.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) ~ Video Conferencing Equipment
Background Information:  The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) is a bureau within the Department of the Interior.  The OSM is organized with Headquarters located in Washington, D.C., and three regional offices  Appalachian (Pittsburgh, PA), Mid-Continent (Alton, IL), and Western (Denver, CO).  The regional offices are comprised of approximately 20 Area and Field offices, and the organization as a whole has approximately 550 employees.   OSM is charged with balancing the nations need for continued domestic coal production with protection of the environment.  This is accomplished through partnership with state and tribal entities.  
OSM is considering purchasing video conferencing equipment and audio/video streaming and storage capability, and research is being conducted on the technology available on the open market.  Each OSM location is typically connected into a common WAN backbone (Verizon Business VBNS+ VPN) at no less than T1 (1.5Mbps) speeds. Currently multicast is not enabled on the WAN backbone nor is Quality of Service (QOS).  Specific uses for videoconferencing technology throughout OSM are:	Delivering advanced (i.e. more than WebEx or Live Meeting) web/audio/video conferencing services	Delivering Director and/or senior level manager messages to employees	Attending virtual meetings requiring face-to-face conversation when it is important to read body language	Conducting every day business meetings	Holding team collaboration meetings	Delivering Conferences and being able to expand the participants to include those needed without additional travel costs	Facilitating course development meetings	Broadcasting live training/presentations 
Video conferencing technology for OSM needs to be able to simultaneously stream live video and display electronic content such as PowerPoint, MS Word, Excel documents or other desktop applications.  System should provide multi screen display (ex. picture in picture) for this capability.  This functionality would be used to review various reports, walk-thru procedural or guidance documents and provide system application demonstrations.
Information Requested: The primary intent of this RFI is to identify current and future industry standards-based videoconferencing solution proposals, including videoconferencing equipment  both portable and stationary, installation and training.   This RFI is for planning purposes only.   The government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with the preparation or submission of the information requested nor for the government's use of that information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the government's assessment of the information received. No basis for claims against the government shall arise as a result of response to this request for information, or in the government's use of such information as either part of an OSM evaluation process or in developing any subsequent policy or announcement. 
Vendor is requested to submit a detailed proposal for as many of the following options as possible.  Please note a separate RFI regarding live streaming audio/video application is also posted.

Background

Historically, the Indian Children’s Program (ICP) was implemented in the mid 1980s to provide multidisciplinary clinical team or teams of health professionals via mobile clinics to Indian Children (0-18 years of age) with special needs residing in remote communities of the southwest region of the United States.  However, in the 1990s as other services and programs were developed and the focus became more on the child’s individual needs, the model changed.  Currently, multidisciplinary health and education teams exist in many service areas and communities and the ICP is addressing the gaps in services by providing supplemental services as requested and/or needed.  In areas where no coordinated multidisciplinary teams exist, then the ICP meets the children’s needs.

Purpose and Objectives

The purpose of this contract is to provide services to meet the needs of American Indian children, 0-18 years of age, with special needs residing or attending school in a southwest region of the United States [New Mexico, northeastern Arizona, southern Colorado (i.e. Navajo, Hopi, and Pueblo reservations)]. The Indian Children’s Program builds on the home based medical model (i.e. services shall be delivered primarily in the homes of clients) and/or the child-centered model. The Contractor will provide assessment and diagnostic services, recommendations and referrals for therapeutic services, treatment and follow-up services, and related training activities to strengthen and build the capacity of children, their families, and communities. Services will also include providing community based organizations, which are responsible for direct service delivery to Indian children with special needs, with services and activities, such as technical assistance, training, planning and development, educational information and materials, and assistive follow-up services in order for them to meet the needs of American Indian children with special needs.  

Project requirements

A highly qualified contractor with knowledge and expertise in the area of American Indian children with special needs and the IHS organization is needed. The technical assistance required is unique, demanding knowledge, skills, and abilities to support agencies and programs serving Indian children with special needs. The service delivery and technical assistance requires professional and technical expertise to ensure best practices in implementing services to this specialized population. The children and youth being served run the gamut of typical, at risk, high-risk, children with special health care and educational needs.

Deliverables that will be required during the contract performance: (1) Monthly community visits and activity reports. (2) A Program Community Advisory Board shall be established with representation from the Maternal Child Health Program, Area Offices (Phoenix, Albuquerque and Navajo), affected family representatives reflective of the tribal affiliation of the clients served, clinicians, student trainees, community leaders including tribal leadership, and other local and regional leadership as appropriate.  The Community Advisory Board shall meet twice per year. (3) A semi-annual and annual report, inclusive of an executive summary (i.e. October 1 through March 31 and October 1 through September 30) shall be prepared and submitted within six weeks of the end of the time period summarizing all of the activities of the Indian Children’s Program.

Anticipated period of performance

IHS plans to award this contract for a twelve-month base period and four twelve-month option years.  The anticipated start date is October 1, 2009.

Timber breakwaters at the mouth of Pantego Creek were authorized for construction by the Corps of Engineers in 1938.  These breakwaters provide protection to Belhaven Harbor, Beaufort County, North Carolina, about 140 miles east of Raleigh.  The proposed project consists of replacing the damaged breakwaters which are each about 1900 feet long, at the entrance to Pantego Creek, separated by a central 500 foot navigation opening.  The existing breakwaters are of a unique fence-like design made of timber pilings, which project above and slightly below the normal water surface.  These structures were designed to dampen waves entering the harbor while maintaining some water circulation through and under the breakwater.  The face of each breakwater is comprised of 4-foot 8-inch long pales (4 x 8) on 12-inch centers (with a nominal 4-in opening between pales) mounted on 8 x 8 horizontal timber wales.  The breakwater face is angled back slightly (about 10 degrees) and has a top height of about 3.5 feet above the water surface and extends about one-foot below the water surface.  The face is supported by 12-in diameter treated pilings constructed in clusters of three, each with a forward piling and two rear batter piles.  The proposed project will include removal of the remaining aging chemically treated timber structure and replacing it with a timber structure having the same basic design features.  <BR><BR>This announcement is part of our market research, and responses are sought to identify sources that have the knowledge, skills, and capability to perform the work.

<SOLNBR>RFI-PKV-09-01
<RESPDATE>061809

<DESC><p>REUSABLE BOOSTER INTEGRATED DEMO - CONCEPT OPTIONS MATURATION STUDY<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>1. This is a special notice open to U.S. industry requesting information on developing and operating a Reusable Booster System (RBS). The RBS is intended to significantly reduce launch cost and improve responsiveness. It is expected that an integrated demonstration project will be required to mature the technologies and processes needed by the RBS concept. Responses are requested to provide information on four key aspects of an operational system and seven key aspects of the demonstration project:</p>
<p>Operational System Aspects<br />a. Vehicle Concept<br />b. Concept of Operations and Capabilities<br />c. Development Approach<br />d. Synergy with other DoD, Civil and commercial applications</p>
<p>Demonstration Project Aspects<br />a. System Integration and Operability<br />b. Ground Support Equipment Technologies<br />c. Airframe Technologies<br />d. Control and Health Management Technologies<br />e. Power, Fluid, Thermal &amp; Actuation Subsystems Technologies<br />f. Main Engines<br />g. Project Approach</p>
<p>This notice is not to be construed as any type of request for proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>2. Operational System Background: Studies have suggested that a Reusable Booster System (RBS) could reduce the cost of space transportation by significantly reducing the amount of flight hardware expended to achieve orbit while maintaining a moderate vehicle stack weight and associated development cost. The RBS concept requires the development of a robust booster system that can be processed quickly and affordably. The architecture consists of a reusable booster that can be integrated with a family of expendable stages to support the full range of DoD payloads from suborbital missions to operationally responsive payloads to heavy-lift missions.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the Air Force Space &amp; Missiles Systems Center (SMC) have and continue to conduct a variety of concept studies and subsystem technology maturation projects that are applicable to RBS concepts. The objective of this section of the Request for Information (RFI) is to identify potential operational RBS concepts, including the family of expendable stages variants, and feasible system development approaches. The operational variant information will provide a better understanding of system options, potential capabilities, and opportunities to leverage industry activities.</p>
<p>3. Demonstration Project Background: To manage limited resources, current AFRL technology projects have focused on a subset of the Reusable Booster System (RBS) concept space. Specifically, the current technology objectives are derived from an unmanned, vertical take-off and horizontal landing (VTHL), rocket-powered, reusable booster concept. During normally expected operations of this concept, the reusable booster uses its rocket engines to autonomously perform a post-staging maneuver (i.e., rocket-back) which orients and positions the booster for a gliding landing near the launch site. This concept includes an integral tank and airframe that bears both internal pressure and flight and ground loads. The concept is powered by pump-fed, LOx-HydroCarbon rocket engines.</p>
<p>Many of the current AFRL technology projects also have applications to other RBS concepts and aerospace systems. The objective of this section of the Request for Information (RFI) is to identify potential integrated demonstration options and feasible project plans that will increase the technology readiness level (TRL) and/or integration readiness level (IRL) of RBS concepts and/or critical component technologies without being constrained by a formal acquisition program or requirement. RFI responses need not be limited to the subset of the RBS concept space described in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>AFRL is considering experiment and demonstration projects with a wide range of technology objectives and program costs. Some project ideas are focused on just a limited number of specific technologies and processes, other concepts mature an integrated suite of technologies and processes, while still other thoughts are of a flight demonstration project with residual operational capability. Some project concepts can be conducted solely through ground tests and experiments, while other ideas require flight demonstration.</p>
<p>In all cases, it is preferred for the flight demonstrator to use a previously developed main engine. A broader range of main engine types (e.g., pressure- or pump-fed, virtually any propellant) would be applicable for an experiment concept focused on some specific technologies and processes. However, for a demonstration of an suite of technologies and processes, a main engine configuration similar to the expected operational system would be preferred.</p>
<p>4. To provide a framework for responses to this RFI and to encourage responses from system subsystem technology suppliers as well as system integrators, four key aspects of operational systems and seven key aspects of the demonstration project have been identified.</p>
<p><br />Operational System Aspects<br />a. Vehicle Concept: This aspect includes a description of the reusable booster, family of expendable stages and associated ground systems. Information about technology and subsystem choices and options is also requested in this aspect.</p>
<p>b. Concept of Operations and Capabilities: This aspect includes a description of how the concept relates within the overall Air Force spacelift architecture, including the range of missions that can be captured by various configurations of the concept. Information about the performance, operability and cost per mission of the concept is also requested in this aspect.</p>
<p>c. Development Approach: This aspect includes a description of the potential costs, cost-sharing arrangements, risks, technology development requirements and the associated timelines for developing the concept. Information about block developments, spiral developments or initial system development with limited capabilities is also requested in this aspect.</p>
<p>d. Synergy with other DoD, Civil and commercial applications: This aspect includes uses of the reusable booster and its family of expendable stages, either separately or together, for other applications. This aspect also includes the use of systems developed for other applications as part of the RBS concept.</p>
<p>It is requested that responses to the demonstration project aspects include information regarding the applicability of the demonstration project to potential RBS concepts. Information about both narrowly focused and broadly applicable demonstration projects are encouraged.</p>
<p>Demonstration Project Aspects<br />a. System Integration and Operability: This aspect includes demonstrations of system level technologies and processes. Included in this aspect is information concerning demonstration of flight characteristics and system performance associated with both nominal operation and robust operation under failure and uncertainty.

<DESC>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring two Proposer’s Day workshops to discuss new strategies that will allow for rapid testing for Salmonella (a three-step process defined as: 1) detection, 2) identification, and 3) subtyping). Though ideally new strategies would complete the entire process from detection through subtyping within 2 days, technologies that shorten the time frame for any of the three steps are of interest. Of particular interest are those methods/technologies that are effective in a variety of food matrices and are capable of subtyping. The development of more rapid and specific analytical detection methods for Salmonella will provide approaches that improve our efforts to detect contamination that may affect soldier and public health and may be applicable to a broader spectrum of pathogens and contaminants. It is anticipated that SAFE-developed techniques will also complement surveillance and outbreak-related schemes utilized by Federal agency partners.

The SAFE proposer’s day workshops will be held at two locations on two different dates with the same overview information being presented at each. This will give participants the option of the most convenient location and date. Access will be limited to one of the two workshops in order to ensure broad public attendance. The East Coast Workshop will be held on Wednesday June 10, 2009, at the Hyatt Regency in Reston, VA. The West Coast Workshop will be held on Friday, July 17, 2009, at the Westin Market Street in San Francisco, CA. The goals of the session are: (a) introduce the research community (industry, academia, and Government) to the SAFE program vision and goals, (b) explain the current need for accelerated Salmonella detection/identification/subtyping, (c) assess current capabilities, and (d) encourage and promote multi-disciplinary teams among potential research organizations that have the relevant expertise, facilities, and potential for executing a research and development plan responsive to the SAFE program. 

The proposer’s day workshop will start with an overview presentation by DARPA in conjunction with the FDA, CDC, USDA, and DHS.  Participants are encouraged to prepare posters describing previous or potential R&D capabilities consistent with the program goals in order to facilitate discussions and formation of well-rounded teams to meet the program metrics. For poster submissions, a one-page abstract must be submitted by May 29, 2009, 4:00PM ET to the East Coast registration website, or by July 2, 2009, 4:00PM ET to the West Coast registration website.  4ft x 4ft posters will be accommodated on a space available basis and will be accepted in order of submission for each location.

There are no registration fees to attend these teaming and information sessions. Details on the workshops, including registration and poster information, can be found at the following URLs:

East Coast Workshop: http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/Index.asp?meetingid=656.  The password for login is: safeeast
The registration deadline date is May 22, 2009.

West Coast Workshop: http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/Index.asp?meetingid=657.  The password for login is: safewest
The registration deadline date is June 29, 2009

Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 75 people, maximum of two from each institution). Additional personnel may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Again, access will be limited to one of the two workshops in order to ensure broad public attendance. Early registration is strongly recommended as space is limited by venue capacity. This special announcement is not a request for proposals; any so sent will be returned.

<DESC>Multi-qubit Coherent Operations Proposers’ Day Conference

SYNOPSIS
The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers’ Day Conference for the Multi-qubit Coherent Operations (MQCO) Program on June, 3, 2009 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30am to 4:00pm at The Inn and Conference Center University of Maryland University College, 3501 University Blvd E, Adelphi, Maryland 20783. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the MQCO Program, to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.

This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers’ Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS
Many and diverse physical systems are being studied and improved as potential carriers and processors of quantum information. These qubits are at various stages of development. Some have already demonstrated small multi-qubit algorithms (atomic ions, photons, superconducting circuits), while others have not yet demonstrated single qubit control. Heretofore, the focus of the scientific effort has centered on achieving the control and speed sufficient for performing information processing tasks, with most of the attention given to the performance of one or two qubits, since operations with these are likely to form the fundamental units of any future quantum information processor.

However, it is well known that additional problems of a different character will be met when attempting to operate multiple qubits at higher qubit densities. The particulars of some of these problems are specific to each qubit type, while others are common to two or more qubit types. It is the goal of the MQCO Program to define, explore, and address these problems, and to demonstrate progress by implementing demonstration algorithms.

Collaborative efforts/teaming among potential performers will be strongly encouraged. It is expected that teams will be formed to enhance the likelihood of program success, whether this be due to the depth of expertise and infrastructure required to succeed against aggressive technical goals, or the breadth required to reduce risk by concurrent pursuit of multiple solutions to critical problems. IARPA anticipates that based on the compelling strength of the self-selected teams, universities and companies from around the world will participate in advancing the state of the art in this area. Researchers will be able to publish their findings in publicly-available, peer reviewed academic journals.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION
Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm EST May 29, 2009 at http://conference.brtrc.com/multi-qubits. Directions to the conference facility and other materials are available on the website.

Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 100 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government issued photo identification to enter the conference.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
The late morning and afternoon will include Presentation & Poster sessions to provide an opportunity for attendees to present organization capabilities and to explore teaming arrangements. Details on the presentation and poster formats, and the procedure for submitting a request to present, will be provided after registering for the Conference. Opportunities to present will be limited by time and will therefore be limited to the first 15 registered respondents with approved presentations, and the first 40 registered respondents with approved posters. Presentations to the Government to solicit feedback is not intended, and Government personnel will not be present during these sessions.

This Proposers’ Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA or participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.

IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.

Questions concerning conference & registration can be sent to IARPAevents@brtrc.com.
Questions regarding the program can be sent to dni-iarpa-baa-09-06@ugov.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the revision of the contract maximum order amount on the Acquisition, Logistics, Management and Business Operations Support (ALMBOS) contract USZA22-02-D-0014 supporting the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  Awarded in December 2001 to Sverdrup Technology Incorporated (now Jacobs Technology Incorporated), this is a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Award Term contract with an anticipated period of performance through April 2010 for acquiring intellectual capital support in the areas of system acquisition and development.  This contract also provides for a wide array of critical support such as Senior Military Planners, Plans Analysts, Intelligence Managers, Senior Psychological Operations Process Analysts, and Technology Experts supporting USSOCOM headquarters, components, Theater Special Operations Commands and the Services (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps) that provide direct support to Special Operations Forces.  To continue ALMBOS critical support, it is necessary to increase the maximum order amount of one of the multiple-award contracts from $400M to $460M, with an additional $45M to $505M, if the Government exercises the Extension of Services clause.  This action is due to an accelerated pace of contract requirements in response to the further expansion of USSOCOM’s operational tempo as it prosecutes Overseas Contingency Operations.  More importantly, in order to ensure a seamless transition period between this contact and the follow-on competitive procurement(s), the last year of task orders may need to be awarded for a full twelve months period of performance.  This will negate the Government from having about one hundred task orders expire on 30 April 2010, and then having to award all new task orders under the follow-on contract(s) on 1 May 2010.  One or more competitive procurements are anticipated as a future follow-on to this contract.

(CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE).[   ]  Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc).

The proprietary data isN/A  [   ] These are direct replacements parts/components for existing equipment.N/A[   ]  The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.N/A[X ]  Authorized by statute  Identify Statute and describe why this authority is being used for this acquisition.Public Law 109-461, Veterans Benefits, Health Care and Information Technology Act of 2006, (effective 6-20-07), 38 U.S.C. 8127  permits the Department of Veterans Affairs to sole source procurements >$100,000 and <$5 million to responsible SDVOSBs and/or VOSBs, if at a fair and reasonable price.  Currently RCDS Contractors Inc. is the only known local SDVOSB construction firm who is technically capable/acceptable for installing and constructing complex electrical systems for Tucsons SAVAHCS facility.  RCDS Contractors Inc. has/is successfully performing on several projects here at SAVAHCS.  Phase I of this project was awarded to Candelaria Corp, who is not eligle for award under this acquisition due to their status as an 8(a) business.  Phase II of this project was awarded to RCDS and is 43% complete.  Phase III is a continuation of phase I & II and RCDS has an intricate knowledge of the existing systems and what will be required to accomplish this project successfully and on time.  It is imperative that the contractor is able to coordinate and understand how the electrical systems are to be configured and interrelate to other electrical portions of the systems.  RCDSs knowledge of the existing system and with what they are installing currently play a large part in a successful project.  It would take a considerable amount of additional time for a new contractor to understand the layout of the electrical system and how the systems are intergraded into the entire SAVAHCS electrical systems.  The additional time required by an alternate contractor will slow the project and add additional costs.  It is therefore in the best interest of the government to award Phase III of the project to RCDS.(6) A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FOM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLICIZED IN FEDBIZOPPS AS REQUIRED BY FAR Subpart 5.2, AND IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER FAR 5.202 APPLIES.No efforts were made to solicit offers from other potential sources since Public Law 109-461 permits VA to reach out to SDVOSB firm with which we wish to contract.  Synopsis is not required in accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(4).(7)  DETERMINE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ANTICIPATED COST WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION: (IAW FAR Part 15.405)It is anticipated to award this acquisition as a firm fixed price contract.  The A&E Firm that designed the project (GLHN of Tucson) has provided a project estimate and will be used in determining the governments estimate.  The government estimate will be the bases for any potential negotiations.  RCDS was previously awarded Phase II of this project under a fair and reasonable price and the negotiated/acceptable proposal received may be used in evaluating any proposal received in response to this acquisition.  This will help in indentifying a baseline in which to compare prices offered.  The acceptable proposal received under Phase I may also be used in determining a fair and reasonable price. (8) A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:Additional market research consisted of searching the following various databases:VETBIZ.gov, Dun & Bradstreet, CCR.gov, ORCA, EPLS as well as other debarred web sitesIt is in the governments best interest to utilize PL 109-461 and pursue a sole-source award to RCDS Contractors Inc..(9) ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.Far 6-302-5 Authorized or Required by Statute(a)Authority.          (1)  Citations: 10 U.S.C 2034(c)(5)                                 (2) Full and Open Competition need not be provided for when  (i) A statute expressly authorizes Statute P.L 109-461 Sec. 502 as codified in 38 U.S.C 8127.   Sole Source Contracts for Contracts above Simplified Acquisition Threshold.  For purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a contracting officer of the Department may award a contract to a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans using procedures other than competitive procedures if --such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity.   --The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C 403)) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and    --The contracting officer has validated that the contractor is registered and certified in the VA VETBIZ.gov data base and qualifies as small in accordance with federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the procurement.The estimated magnitude of $1M to $2M within the limits for the sole source award authority. (10)    A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION.RCDS was the only contractor contacted concerning this acquisition and no other parties responded.(11) A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIREDN/A  This sole source procurement is permitted under Public Law 109-461, 38 USC 8127CONTRACTING OFFICERS  CERTIFICATION: I CERTIFY THAT THIS JUSTIFCATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION IS ACCURATE AND COMPLETE TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF.______John T.

<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

<DESC>     The 96th Contracting Squadron, Eglin AFB, Florida intends to solicit and award a firm-fixed price contract for a Computed Micro Tomography X-Ray Machine (specific description below).  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  The announcement number is F1TBAP9092A001.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard. This is a full and open competition.

Background:  

     We are seeking a tool to investigate the microstructures of composite materials ranging from energetic materials to concretes.  We would like to make non-destructive measurements and construct a 3-D renderings which could then be input into a computer model, as well as use these microstructures to determine characteristics of the compacted materials such as specific surface area of primary particles and particle/pore geometry characteristics.  Particle sizes of organic explosive might be as small as several microns, while the aggregate in concrete would be considerably larger, and therefore require samples greater than 65 mm in diameter.
     We are specifically interested in taking the 3-D structures provided by the XCMT machine and turning it into a computational mesh. This would probably best be done if the 3-D image is in some kind of CAD format.  In any event, we want to take the actual internal structure and generate a computational mesh in order to perform analysis on that known structure.  
     We would like to have the capability to perform dynamic tensile and compression testing of specimens, this is not mandatory but it is highly desired.


The requirement consists of the following items:  
     1 Computed Micro Tomography X-Ray Machine

Description:  
Minimum Requirements:
1.	At a 5 mm sample size, 1 micron resolution is required.
2.	At a 50 mm sample size, 10 micron resolution is required.
3.	Largest sample size to be at least 65 mm diameter by 100 mm long.
4.	The ability to handle materials that have similar material contrast. For example, must be able to resolve table sugar dispersed in a polyurethane binder, as well as fine aluminum powder (~20 micron) dispersed in a polyurethane binder.
5.	Must be able to examine samples that are irregularly shaped.
6.	Require that the XCMT can effectively handle a large variety of materials from carbon fiber composites, polymer foams, machined parts, metal specimens and high explosives with large range of Z materials.
7.	Ability to convert the data to 3-D computer generated image which can be put into a mesh file for computer simulations.
8.	 Must be able to fit through a 6 foot wide and 6 foot high door.
9.	 Software for quantitative analysis and for presentation.
10.	Must produce negligible X-Ray signature outside of instrument so that no dosimeter is required for personnel when working with or around the XCMT continuously (2000 hrs/yr).
11.	 New Materials: All parts used in this system must be new. No recycled, refurbished, or otherwise used parts are permitted in this system.
12.	 Utility Requirements:  The vendor will provide all electronic controllers as well as interconnection and power cables required for operation using 110 VAC, 60 Hz power. The system must be air cooled and not require water hook-up.  If chilled water is required for instrument cooling, the chilling unit must be provided with the instrument and operate using 100V, 60Hz power. Vendor will describe in writing the utility requirements (including connections and capacity) upon contract approval so that appropriate infrastructure arrangements can be made prior to shipment of XCMT.
13.	Documentation/Data:  Require a copy of all documentations, user instructions prior shipments.
14.	Delivery, Installation, and Training:   Provide approximately delivery date of the system, installation of system on site, and training for two operators.
15.	Serviceability and Warranty: Vendor will clearly describe which parts are covered under the standard Warranty, the duration of the standard Warranty. Vendor is invited to propose as an option an extended Warranty plan which will cover all parts, labor, and travel charges for a limited time period.
16.	Vendors are invited to submit as an option a tensile/compression load cell capable of at least 440 N for a sample size diameter of at least 20 mm in the XCMT.
17.	Vendors are invited to submit as an option advanced computational capabilities to reduce time required to manipulate/transform data, or convert data between different file formats.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. 2009-N-11155 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 29. This procurement has been set aside 100 percent for Small Businesses. The associated NAICS code and small business size standard are 541618 and $7 Million. The total period of performance under this contract shall be 7 months from date of award.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seeks to continue its use of standard vocabulary in the Health Level Seven (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) implementation specifications under development for reporting healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) data from healthcare facilities that use vendor infection control surveillance applications to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Phase III of the CDA for HAI reporting project will extend technical guidance for reporting HAIs, previously developed in Phases I and II of the project, to a new set of reporting requirements. These reporting requirements include vocabulary needed to convey HAI data in accordance with (1) NHSN specifications, (2) healthcare informatics and information technology standards, and (3) Public Health Information Network Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (PHIN VADS) requirements.</p>
<p>Phase III of the CDA for HAI reporting projectwill provide a standards-based solution that enables healthcare facilities that use commercial infection control surveillance applications to report HAI data to NHSN without having to perform duplicate entry of NHSN events and procedures. In States that mandate use of NHSN by healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction, development and implementation of an additional option for those facilities to participate in NHSN will strengthen CDC's collaborations with the States and the healthcare facilities in their jurisdictions. The time sensitivity of enabling use of this option for reporting HAI data to NHSN places a premium on identifying and retaining a healthcare vocabulary specialist who has prior technical familiarity with NHSN, healthcare vocabulary standards, and PHIN VADS requirements.</p>
<p>CDC goals are 1) to provide additional options for submitting data to NHSN, the CDA work products shall be maintained and updated as needed; and 2) to use healthcare industry standard vocabulary for collecting HAI data from disparate infection control surveillance systems. To achieve these goals, CDC seeks services of a qualified contractor to provide the following tasks and sub-tasks:<br /><br />TASK 1: Provide IG Maintenance and Vocabulary. (These items are being acquired on the basis of Time and Materials (T&amp;M).) <br />1.1 Maintain and update a single NHSN local code system (this task will be initiated by NHSN)<br />1.2 Addition of SSN# to patient data section<br />1.3 Additional rounds of balloting (if needed) after the initial round including attendance at WGM (1 person)<br />1.4 On-going modifications to the IG and supporting work products as a result of NHSN program changes.<br />1.5 MDRO modifications identified as result of web interface move into production.<br />1.6 Removal of OTH procedure code from vocabulary.<br />1.7 Concurrent changes to vocabulary tables in IG and NHSN, XML sample instance, Schematron, generate-narrative and display transforms.<br />1.8 Enhance and update online validator for batch processing through custom interface with NHSN host.</p>
<p>TASK 2: Provide data collection to add the following forms to the current Implementation Guide: BSI Summary form for SPC location; BSI Summary form for NICU location; MDRO and CDAD Prevention; and Outcome Measures Monthly Monitoring Form Lab ID Form. These items will be acquired on the basis of FFP (Firm-fixed price). The following subtasks are required:<br />2.1 Develop Implementation Guide additions including clinical statement design. <br />2.2 Produce complete sample instance document (XML)<br />2.3 Develop generate-narrative transform<br />2.4 Develop Schematron and test files<br />2.5 Modify display transform<br />2.6 Incorporate vocabulary into PHIN VADS<br />2.7 Attend HL7 WGM (travel expenses and hours for 1 person)<br />2.8 Modify IG to accommodate the addition of hosting NHSN vocabulary via PHIN VADS, adding references (URL or other)<br />2.9 Populate authoring tables for the inclusion of existing NHSN CDA vocabulary into PHIN VADS. <br />2.10 Update IG to reflect consolidation of local codes into single NHSN local code system (includes vocab tables, conformance statements, etc.<br />2.11 Migrate existing templates into data element database</p>

<p>Part I: The Technical Proposal: The following information is required for technical evaluation:<br />1. Experience and Qualification: To demonstrate experience and qualifications, quoters shall show how their experience developing CDA implementation guidance for public health uses will enhance the prospects for successful implementation guidance for HAI reporting. Prior success in introducing and gaining approval for CDA work products from the Health Level Seven (HL7) Structured Documents Work Group (SDWG) will facilitate establishing the CDA for HAI reporting data as a HL7 standard. <br />2. Technical Approach: Quoters shall provide a technical description, in as much detail as possible, reflecting the offeror's understanding of the government requirements. It shall include the experience and qualifications of key personnel for the job. The technical approach shall explain in detail HOW the quoter proposes to meet each aspect of the proposed SOW as follows:<br />i. Demonstrate how the project is to be organized, staffed, and managed including how the management and coordination of consultant and/or subcontractor efforts will be accomplished.<br />ii. Identify clearly the name and title of the person who will provide program direction.<br />iii.

Explain how the quality for all services and tasks proposed for this project will be accomplished and the proposed quality control plan.<br />3. Past Performance: Past performance is one indicator of the offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully by delivering with predictability and reliability with adequately staffed, trained, sufficient technical and human resource availability. The government will evaluate different customers' opinions about how well (quality) and cost effectively the offeror has satisfied their requirements. Offerors shall provide as part of their proposal a list of clients or former clients for whom they have performed same or similar work to the one required by this solicitation during the past 5 years.

<p>(a) Price: Price will be evaluated to determine its fairness, and reasonableness as it relates to the item offered.</p>
<p>(b) Past Performance: Past performance will be evaluated to ensure satisfactory business practices, quality, schedule, and timely performance. Past performance is significantly more important than price. The government may base its judgment on information obtained through any form of assessment reporting systems, statements of opinion from any source provided by the offeror and/or obtained by the government, the contracting officer's/evaluation team members' knowledge, customer surveys, or other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ (e.g., past performance for contracts for the same or close to the same effort (manufacturing of embroidery shoulder boards or other complex embroidery items, for example, patches) will have greater past performance impact than contracts that are less complex than the requirement as described herein).</p>
<p>If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have an exceptional performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance confidence rating of "very good" or higher.</p>

Before first article approval, the costs thereof shall not be allocable to this contract for<br />(1) Progress payments, or<br />(2) Termination settlements if the contract is terminated for the convenience of the Government.<br />(i) The Government may waive the requirement for first article approval test where supplies identical or similar to those called for in the schedule have been previously furnished by the Offeror/Contractor and have been accepted by the Government. The Offeror/Contractor may request a waiver.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

2) Past Performance
3) Total Price Proposed

In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the total price.  Contractors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the contractor with lowest cost.  The Government reserves the right to evaluate proposals and make award without conducting discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussions with one or more offerors and request revised proposals.  Although price is not the determining factor for award, it may become the determining factor for award if two or more offers, after technical evaluations are completed, are determined to be technically equal.

Factor I - Technical Capability

a.  Contract Requirements - Proposals will be evaluated on the offerors ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to lodging, meeting space, and food and beverage requirements. Proposals must address the offerors’ ability to comply with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it relates to lodging and meeting spaces.

Site Visits will be conducted to evaluate the accommodations, conference rooms, location and amenities.

b.  Location - Proposals will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide a facility located in downtown Washington, D.C. within walking distance of NLRB headquarters at 1099 14th Street, NW and metro stations.

c.  Availability of Dates - Proposals will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide the required services on the dates requested.

d.  Other Considerations; transportation to major airports, availability and cost of on-site guest parking and diversified, adequate and reasonable food services must be available on-site and within walking distance.

e.  Availability of Daily/Overnight self-pay parking on Days One through Day Five for up to 40 people.

Factor II - Past Performance

The offeror must provide references for at least three (3) federal government contracts for similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The offeror will be evaluated based on customer satisfaction and timeliness on requirements similar size and scope.  The contact information for each reference shall include the following: 

Contract type
Contract number
Contract Value
Agency/Company Name
Agency/Company point of contact telephone number
Duration of Contract
Type of services provided (brief description)
List any problems encountered on each contract and the contractor’s corrective actions

In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Factor III – Price

Proposed prices will be compared to proposed cost of same or similar services in order to determine if the proposed prices are realistic, fair and reasonable.  Although price is not the determining factor for award, it may become the determining factor for award if two or more offers, after technical evaluations are completed, are determined to be technically equal.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPROSAL.  The U. S. Postal Service Northeast Facilities Service Office is seeking Qualification Statements from environmental construction contractors wishing to be pre-qualified for an Indefinite Quantity Job Order Contract (IQ JOC) for asbestos, lead-based paint, and mold abatement at postal facilities within the Northeast Facilities Service Office territory.  Contractors may select one or more geographic areas for pre-qualification.  The geographic areas are listed at the end of this advertisement.

<DESC>Upper Truckee River
Stream Channel Restoration Analysis and Design Project 

The USDA Forest Service, Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU), South Lake Tahoe, California, is seeking a qualified consultant to provide professional services to develop final (100%) design plans (i.e., engineering plans with specifications) from the existing 50% designs to restore Reach 5 of the Upper Truckee River. The consultant will be responsible for incorporating the comments received on the 50% design plans into the final designs, for obtaining design information about the upstream and downstream channel restoration projects to ensure compatibility, and for validating and/or revising the designs by comparing them with a reference channel reach. The project is located in El Dorado County and is accessible from Elks Club Drive at the junction with Highway 50.

The Watershed

The Upper Truckee River watershed is approximately 54 square miles in size. Elevations in the watershed range from 6,224 ft at the rivers mouth at Lake Tahoe to approximately 10,000 feet. The project area consists of a floodplain meadow formed along a low gradient portion of the lower Upper Truckee River watershed. 

Project Location

The upstream end of the project site is a few thousand feet below the Highway 50 crossing at Elks Club Drive. The project reach (Reach 5) extends from that location, near the southeast corner of the Lake Tahoe Airport runway, to approximately 8,000 feet downstream to the US Forest Service property boundary. 

Scope of Work

Professional and technical services shall include all labor, materials, equipment, and facilities, as required to conduct the analysis for design, to be the basis for the development of engineering plans and specifications. The contractor, the LTBMU Stream Restoration Group, and a California Tahoe Conservancy (CTC) representative will function as a team, accomplished through field meetings, office meetings, and email communication.

COMPONENTS OF THE ANALYSIS FOR DESIGN SHOULD INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:
	Soils, meadow soil stratification, and vegetation characterization	Implementation constraints (including wildlife habitat and vegetation communities present, public utilities, and property boundaries)
	Assessment of appropriate channel substrate material (for channel bed and banks)
	Preliminary design validation 
	Assessment of local functional analogue channel. 
	Multiple reach unsteady flow flood hydraulic analysis.


COMPONENTS OF DESIGN PLAN DEVELOPMENT SHOULD INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:
	Hydraulic and geomorphic synopsis
	Geomorphically compatible tie-ins to the existing channel both upstream and downstream of the project reach
	Incorporation of aquatic habitat features
	Meadow revegetation as part of site rehabilitation
	Plans and specifications 

The work to be performed by the consultant shall consist of, but is not limited to, the following items and sub-items:

1.	USFS coordination. A USFS restoration hydrologist and a representative from the CTC will be part of the consultant’s design team from the analysis for design through final project design. There will be bi-monthly coordination among the design team, as needed, regarding the progress and status of the project and related issues through meetings or personal communications.

2.	Other coordination meetings. Three additional coordination meetings will be required before completing the 75% design plans, with; 1) the preparers of the 50% plans, 2) the South Tahoe Public Utility District; and 3) the upstream and downstream project teams.

3.	Analysis for design and design report. A professional memo that summarizes all analyses and conclusions described in the Components of the Analysis for Design section above, and any other analyses developed during contract negotiation and/or during the assessment phase of the contract and agreed upon by both USFS Restoration Staff and the contractor.

4.	Preparation of Design Plans and Specifications.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the close out date of this solicitation&nbsp;to 1 pm MDT on 18 May 2009 and to provide answers to the below questions from potential contractors:</p>
<p>Question: Special site requirements such as unusual or site-specific low-voltage building codes, needs for underground work or trenching, and presence of barrier walls or floors in buildings also affect the estimates for installation time and project costs. We'd like to be sure of these requirements before providing an accurate proposal. These issues can be addressed through a drawing, interview, or site visit.</p>
<p>Answer: There should be no need for any of the above. Cameras should be mounted onto existing walls.</p>
<p>Question: An understanding of the goals of the surveillance task would enable us to provide the best technical solutions for your needs. Issues that generally need discussion include the times and scenes of interest: day activity versus night, authorized versus unauthorized activity monitoring, presence of guards or operators, need for off-site or networked access to surveillance images, integration with existing systems and the need for continuous or motion-sensitive recording. With a good understanding we can minimize costs and maximize effectiveness of a new system. A brief interview with the technical POC or area supervisor would be sufficient to address these issues.</p>
<p>Answer: The surveillance is of children, staff, and parents on the outside playground and in the hallways during the day. The cameras would need to be integrated in work with what we currently have. Cameras would need to be continuous surveillance.</p>

<p>Solicitation provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD USING LOWEST PRICE TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE (LPTA) PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>a. Basis for Contract Award:<br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated cost or price, which is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by 52.212-2, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items of this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. Number of Contracts to be Awarded:<br />The Government intends to select one contractor for the Louden Requirements. However, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals and prices submitted and the availability of funds.</p>
<p>c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost/price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>d. Correction Potential of Proposals:<br />The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any proposal uncertainty. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal not meeting the Government's requirements is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS</p>
<p>a. List factors and Subfactors:<br />The Government will evaluate for acceptability the factors described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1- Technical Proposal <br />Factor 2- Cost/Price <br />Factor 3-Past Performance</p>
<p>b. Evaluation Methodology:<br />Technical acceptability will be evaluated on all offers. Only those offerors determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Then, price will be evaluated and the proposals will be listed from lowest to highest price based on the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>Then, the offerors' past performance will be evaluated starting with the lowest price technically acceptable offer. Only those offerors determined to have an acceptable past performance rating, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. Past performance evaluations will cease when the first two technically acceptable proposals receive an acceptable past performance rating for price comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the lowest evaluated priced proposal meeting the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.</p>
<p>c. Technical Factor:<br />By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation technical requirements, to include the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, and will be determined technically acceptable. If the offeror is unable to meet the Government's Required Delivery Schedule, the offeror may set forth the delivery schedule the offeror is prepared to meet. However, should the offeror's proposed delivery schedule not meet the Required Delievery Schedule and should the Government determine such proposed delivery schedule to be unacceptable, the offeror will be determined UNACCEPTABLE. If the offeror's proposed delivery is determined acceptable, the solicitation will be amended and each offeror will be afforded an opportunity to revise their proposals. If the offeror does not propose a different delivery schedule, the Government's Required Delivery Schedule shall apply. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Each proposal will receive one of the ratings described below for Factor 1 - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Acceptable - The proposal meets specified minimum requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The proposal fails to meet specified minimum requirements necessary for contract performance. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.</p>
<p>d. Cost/Price Factor:</p>
<p>Cost/Price Evaluation: The offeror's cost/price proposal will be evaluated for award purposes by adding the total price for basic requirements (basic award).</p>
<p>Total Evaluated Price: Price analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be calculated as the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) unit/extended prices plus other associated factors such as transportation costs if appropriate.</p>
<p>Unrealistically Low Costs or Prices: Unrealistically low proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing: Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalance pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The Government shall analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced line items or subline items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>e. Past Performance Factor:<br />Past performance information may be gathered from both Government (such as RYG, MOCAS, CPARS) and commercial sources. Offerors will not be penalized if no past performance information is available. Past performance will either be satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory where satisfactory equals a neutral or determination of responsibility, and unsatisfactory equals a determination of non-responsibility. Any unsatisfactory rating given to a small business will be referred to the Small Business Administration pursuant to FAR 15.101-2(b) and 19.6 for resolution.</p>
<p>f. Discussions:<br />It is the Government's intent to award without discussions, therefore, it is imperative that offerors submit their best terms initially. However, if during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) will be considered in making the source selection decision.<br /><br />PRE-AWARD SURVEY<br /><br />The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offerors' capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>PLANT VISITS<br /><br />In the event discussions are necessary, plant visits may be conducted during the evaluation phase to develop knowledge for judging the potential for correction of deficiencies. <br /><br />SOLICITATION REQUIREMENTS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br />Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub-factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items (FEB 2009) and 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items-Alternate 1 (APR 2002) with their offer.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. section 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>4. ADDENDUM to FAR 52.212-1(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts in the past three years for manufacturing distinctive uniforms, for similar type uniforms or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information).</p>
<p>5. Addenda to FAR 52.212-1, Proposal Preparation Instructions.<br />(a) Initially, Quotes will be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the unit price for to confirm the extended amount. <br />(b) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "High Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the government and evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>6. Addendum to FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>The government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 and 13. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) past performance and price. The tradeoff process will be determined on the basis of the comparative assessment of offerors' past performance and price.</p>
<p>(a) Price: Price will be evaluated to determine its fairness, and reasonableness as it relates to the item offered.</p>
<p>(b) Past Performance: Past performance will be evaluated to ensure satisfactory business practices, quality, schedule, and timely performance. Past performance is significantly more important than price. The government may base its judgment on information obtained through any form of assessment reporting systems, statements of opinion from any source provided by the offeror and/or obtained by the government, the contracting officer's/evaluation team members' knowledge, customer surveys, or other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ (e.g., past performance for contracts for the same or close to the same effort (manufacturing of embroidery shoulder boards or other complex embroidery items, for example, patches) will have greater past performance impact than contracts that are less complex than the requirement as described herein).</p>
<p>If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have an exceptional performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance confidence rating of "very good" or higher.</p>

<DESC>This AMENDMENT to the COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION responds to vendor questions submitted by May 11, 2009 at 12 PM Eastern Time. Quotes are still due by May 19, 2009 at 3 PM Eastern Time. No extensions are anticipated. All other terms and requirements of the original solicitation remain unchanged.
Vendor Questions and Government Responses
The Q&A will also be posted to the solicitation announcement at http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/solic/openmarket.asp (NBCWZ900441)
Q1.	Is a site visit possible? If not, can the designated work areas be described in detail? 
A1. A site visit is not possible.  The baskets are stored in existing closed shelving units in a very large open storage area.  There is a secured work room with tables, shelves, lighting, computer hook-ups, sink etc.  This room is approximately 20 feet by 40 feet.  There should be ample room for up to four technicians to work on multiple baskets.
Q2.	Please clarify what the guidelines for the storage mounts are- i.e. does each object require it own box? Will all baskets be mounted and stored on existing shelving units? 
A2. Each basket does NOT need a box.  Each basket will be stored on existing shelving.  Each basket does need custom made support to ensure that its shape is maintained and materials are not abraded or pressured.
Q3.	Is there a database that has already been created for the condition reports of the objects, notes and photographs to be entered electronically or will that database need to be created and/or developed by the contractor? Is the Ramer Report available in a Word document format? How much registrarial work will be required of the contractor or will DOI staff be handling this?
A3. Yes, there is an existing electronic database in which the contractor can input the information noted.  The Ramer report exists only in hard copy and PDF.  In our estimation, a large portion of the work outlined in the SOW is "registrarial work".  An Interior Museum registrar will be on site at least one day per week.

<DESC>AMENDMENT A001
The above referenced solicitation is hereby amended to respond to technical questions submitted.  

The due date for quotations, 3:30 PM local time on March 18, 2009, remains unchanged.

QUESTION:  Item 7 seems fairly clear now, in that it appears that this relates to the ability to do 3D X-ray Maps in combination with the FIB. As mentioned this afternoon, FEI has contacted _(THE VENDOR)____ to do this exact thing with the NNL600, and that meeting will take place next week. Delaying the bid response date by 2 weeks would allow us (and other competitors who FEI is also working with) to know exactly what is possible, and to supply NIST with a system that more closely matches your needs. This sort of compatibility and integration requires that the EDS company and FEI work closely together, and the project is still being defined by FEI.
      
RESPONSE:  For Line Item 0007, NIST is talking about the ability to communicate with an FEI
instrument.  All EDX vendors can do this currently.  NIST currently has an Oxford EDS system that is integrated with the NNL600 system.  NIST also has a custom solution that takes care of the 3D X-ray mapping (non FEI or Oxford).  

Inclusion of this requirement ensures that the system purchased has the same on the fly analysis capability stated in items 1-5 and can get the signal from NIST’s existing NNL600.

Discussion vendors are having to do 3D X-ray mapping is not relevant to item 7 because NIST currently has a way to deal with this.

QUESTION:  Item 8 - Capability to Interface is still very vague. In essence, it appears that you are asking us if we will write code for you for an as-yet-unknown feature or capability sometime in the future. Without knowing what it is that you  may want to do (and what FEI is willing to do), I don't know how any responsible company could say yes to this.

RESPONSE:  Item 8 is only specifying whether quoters are able to provide programming services to NIST.  It is attractive to hire a programming service from the EDS system provider since they will be more knowledgeable about the detection system then a generic software solution provider.  So the key question is, does the quoter have the capability to provide custom software development service.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>**ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS**</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;">The tech question I had concerns task 3 Hardware and Software. The SOW lists the following: </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Symbol;">&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Magnetic capture device USB cable for MINI123/123EX; RS232</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 1.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cable for MSR500; USB cable for MPR2000, USB cable for TA32, RS232 Cable for PMR202</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #000000;">Each of these devices is a magnetic card reader (a MSR500, a MPR2000, a T32 and a PMR202) with a particular type of interface cable. However, the line in the SOW reads as if you're requesting individual cables. I do not see where individual cables are an option. Meaning that you are actually asking for readers with particular interfaces. Correct? The readers are expensive and if you're looking for cables only I need the specs for those cables, if the indeed exist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000080; font-family: Arial;">Cables only for student issue. We have readers for class demo purposes. I purchased cables from incode corp (exeba) in the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri;">I've got a question about the SOW you sent.&nbsp; It appears that it is to create a custom course, and then deliver it this June.&nbsp; The timing of creating a course and delivering it next month seems a little tight.&nbsp; Can you confirm that the course is scheduled for delivery in June 2009?&nbsp; And if so, I am assuming you are looking for a vendor that already has this course developed, rather than custom development of such a class. &nbsp;Is that correct?</span></p>
<p>June delivery is correct.</p>

1.       Each quantity requests a Magnum Light Generator, followed by a suffix: NGL, SON, AJO, TUS, and DGL.  A review of Magnums website indicates they have lite generators, but not any with the suffixs shown.
2.      The options/accessories listed for all:  electric winch, battery disconnect, lens guard, and anti glare visor are items that are used on light towers; not just a generator or light generator.  A review of Magnums light towers does not show that they have any with the listed suffixs.
3.      A review of Magnums GSA website does not show any specific model that relate to the listed suffixs.
 


ANSWER: I believe they are concerned with the abbreviations after each item.  (i.e., SON, TUS, DGL, etc.) 
 
These are our BP Station identifiers  not part numbers.  For example, SON means Sonoita BP Station, DGL means Douglas BP Station and so on.   It just indicates how many of each item each station has requested in their part of the bulk purchase.<BR><BR>

This information must be provided in order to determine eligibility – DO NOT SEND COPIES OF YOUR CCR PROFILE; 

(3) letter from bonding agent stating your firm’s capability to bond for a single project of $25,000,000 million, and your firm’s aggregate bonding capacity; and

PROJECT DETAILS:  The project is located approximately 60 miles (97 km) northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada in Lake Mead National Recreation Area. The proposed project will rehabilitate 17.5 miles (28.2 km) of Northshore Road between mileposts 27.3 to 47.6. The route is entirely within the Lake Mead NRA. Project work includes rehabilitation, restoration, spot reconstruction (3.3 m (5.3 km)), and resurfacing of the existing roadway, parking areas, and pullouts. Roadway rehabilitation consists of widening the roadway using aggregate base to achieve the design width; pulverizing the existing asphalt pavement and aggregate base; placing of aggregate base to correct superelevation and crown; and resurfacing with hot asphalt concrete pavement. Roadway reconstruction is identified in areas where existing roadway deficiencies are excessive and can not be corrected with rehabilitation. This work includes removing the existing pavement; minor excavation and embankment to construct the subgrade; placing of aggregate base; and resurfacing with hot asphalt concrete pavement. In addition, project work includes the removal of inferior subgrade material (sub-excavation), drainage improvements (culvert/drop inlet installations and extensions, cleaning culverts, headwall construction, concrete curb and gutter construction, and riprap installation); reinforced concrete low water crossing construction, temporary tortoise fence, historic masonry work, and other incidentals. Masonry work includes reconstruction of historic stone headwalls that need to be dismantled and reconstructed. The roadway is currently open to public traffic and will remain open during construction with short delays. The construction will be completed in three segments. The contract will require paving of one segment before pavement is removed or pulverized on another section. The work is anticipated to take between 6 to 12 months starting in August 2009.  When the solicitation is issued, contractors will be required to price bid items and bid the number of calendar days they will take to construct the project. 

MAJOR WORK ITEMS AND ESTIMATED QUANTITIES (Quantities subject to change):
•	Roadway Excavation: 15,000 m3 
•	Subexcavation: 5,000 m3 
•	Pulverizing: 25 km

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334519   This modification is to answer the questions received for this RFQ. Questions and answers are below:
1) Is Appendix 1 interactive, so that the fields can be filled in? If so, how do you initiate it?
The Appendix is not an interactive form.
2) Should requested additional pricing not listed as an item be added to the pricing sheet after item #33?
Yes, please provide any additional pricing you may have in your quote.
3) For items 30 - 33 are we supposed to fill in pricing here? If so, what kind of pricing are you requesting?
The intent for line items 30 - 33 is that they will contain a total price for each of the corresponding option periods (using the minimum ordering quantities specified in the RFQ). It is requested that the vendor submit a pricing sheet for the base year and each of the four option periods that breaks down the pricing for line items 1 - 29 (for a total of five separate pricing sheets). The EPA will update the Purchase Order at the beginning of each option period to change the prices in line items 1 - 29 to match the corresponding vendor quote for that period.
