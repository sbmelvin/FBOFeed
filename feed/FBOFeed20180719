<DESC><p>NOTICE OF CONTRACTUAL ACTION FOR NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR Development and Testing of a Multi-Phenomenology<br />Sensor Package for the MS-177. This is an announcement that the United States Air Force<br />(USAF), Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) intends to issue/award an Indefinite Delivery,<br />Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to United Technologies Aerospace Systems (UTAS), Westford,<br />MA for the purpose of long-range ISR technology maturation and demonstration under the<br />authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A). This is a maturation and demonstration of component<br />technologies in which the Government has invested over the last decade. Developed across<br />numerous contracts, these state-of-the-art technologies include a UTAS-designed shortwave<br />infrared (SWIR) sensor system, a novel UTAS-designed telescope, a Government-designed multimode ladar system, a novel hyperspectral imager, and the Government-owned AgilePod&reg; family<br />of pods. The estimated value of this contract is $92M with an overall period of performance<br />anticipated to begin in FY19, ending in FY23.</p>
<p><br />The contractor shall be responsible for integrating the above sensors and telescope into an MS-177<br />and flight testing them either inside an AgilePod&reg; mounted on a U-2 or on an RQ-4. The sensors<br />must be installed concurrently without violating the size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations of<br />the MS-177 and without degrading the performance of the UTAS-designed telescope. Sensor<br />output must conform to existing MS-177 data processing, exploitation, and dissemination<br />pipelines. This effort involves complex phenomenology and detailed engineering that requires<br />specialized expertise and knowledge. This effort requires contractor use and proficiency with the<br />MS-177 sensor system as well as the U-2 and/or RQ-4.</p>
<p><br />UTAS is a for-profit company which conducts research in the field of sensor technology with a<br />focus on high-altitude, long-range sensors and data exploitation. UTAS is the sole developer and<br />manufacturer of the MS-177 sensor system.</p>
<p><br />Vendors who are capable of providing the effort above shall fully identify their interest and submit,<br />in writing, information documenting their qualifications and capabilities to meet the requirements<br />stated above within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Responses must be submitted to<br />Joseph Strehle, Contracting Officer, via email at Joseph.Strehle@us.af.mil. Responses received<br />after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis<br />and will not be considered. Other business opportunities for AFRL are available at<br />www.fedbizopps.gov. The proposed contract action is for products which the government intends<br />to solicit and negotiate with UTAS under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(A). Interested<br />persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit<br />proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the<br />Government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received to this<br />notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be<br />considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact (POC) identified in this announcement.</p>
<p><br />5. General Operations Security (OPSEC) procedures, policies and awareness are required in an<br />effort to reduce program vulnerability from successful adversary collection and exploitation of<br />critical information. The Critical Information List (CIL) will be provided upon request by<br />AFRL/RYOY Information Protection Office. While working on the government installation,<br />OPSEC guidance will be provided by the AFRL/RYOY Information Protection Office.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center on Birth Defects and Developmnetal Disabilities (NCCDDD), intends to award a sole source contract to ICF Incorporated, LLC, 9300 Lee Hwy, Fairfax, VA 22031-6050 to support the development of a year-long, distance-based training for CDC MCH epidemiologists assigned to state health departments and CDC Atlanta-based MCHEP staff on measurement and translation of health equity in MCH epidemiologic work on special topics. This will involve development of a course syllabus, lecture series, and identification of lecturers; provision of technical support and subject matter expertise in policy and health equity analysis and dissemination of complex analytic findings; and development of a final product from each participating team.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541618, Other Management Consulting Services. The period of performance for this procurement is 6 months.<br /><br />The services being acquired represent a need to develop data-driven digital learning modules illustrating evidence-based parenting skills from the FIT curriculum. The digital learning modules need a vendor with documented experience in using evaluation data to produce effective digital learning models following adult learning principles that will meet industry standards for inclusion on Continuing Education applications. Due to previous knowledge of the FIT curriculum and experience producing data-driven digital learning modules based on effective adult learning principles, ICF is the only one that could complete the task in the necessary time frame<br /><br />Program initially looked at similar tasks that have been completed by other programs at CDC and initially decided to complete this under what we believed was an available Delivery Order contract. After contacting our representative in our Resource office, we were informed that the contractor listed indicated that that contract was no longer available for use. We then researched both small business and the open market, but due to the nature of the request, which required that the task be completed by a contractor with prior knowledge and expertise in three key areas (data-driven curriculum development, adult education, and digital communications) no other capable vendors were found. <br /><br />To determine industry capabilities for this requirement market research was conducted by examining current contracts to determine if the required task could be satisfied by the open market, and by speaking with other CDC programs who have training curricula. The internet search produced entities that were capable of developing videos and curriculum. However, because of the urgency to have the modules ready for piloting in October, we need a vendor with the proven expertise in data-driven curriculum development, adult learning principles, and digital communications to complete the task.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to ICF Incorporated, LLC. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 18-Q-68875 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN August 3, 2018. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<CONTACT>Philippa D Butts, Contracts Specialist, Phone 7704882684, Fax 7704882847, Email ezo2@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>Project Overview<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) operates high-containment laboratories (HCLs) to study some of the most virulent threats to public health. Outbreaks involving pathogens such as the Ebola and Zika viruses place increased pressure on our national research resources to maintain appropriate biocontainment environments. CDC's need for continuous high-biosafety level (BSL) containment laboratory space is growing as the threats from existing and emerging high-consequence pathogens are discovered. The design and construction of the High-Containment Continuity Laboratory (HCCL) on the Roybal Campus in Atlanta, Georgia will meet these needs.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation includes full and complete Architectural/Engineering (A/E) design and related services. The Architect-Engineer shall furnish architectural, laboratory planning, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, structural, civil, and any other design disciplines required to perform pre-design studies, program development, investigations, evaluations, design and construction document production, cost estimates, construction administration services, commissioning support, participation in an independent value engineering process, and other related professional services. The Government will utilize the services of a Construction Manager as contractor (CMc) for pre-construction and construction services. The A/E will be required to work with the CMc firm at the pre-design phase through project completion and will agree to accept the relationship of trust and confidence, and covenants with the Government, to furnish the requisite skill and judgements and to cooperate with the CMc in furthering the interests of the Government.</p>
<p>The A/E contract award shall be in accordance with a Two Phase Design Selection Procedure. This procurement is unrestricted with regard to business size.

<p>Description<br />The HCCL will be a highly flexible biological laboratory comprised of BSL-3E and BSL-4 laboratories and associated support. The multi-story research building will house adequate laboratory space for eighty laboratorians. The HCCL will have gross building area of approximately 100,000 square feet.</p>
<p>All biosafety features and systems of high containment laboratories will be included such as HEPA filtered supply and exhaust air, air pressure resistant doors, pressure cascade zoning, effluent collection and treatment, pressure decay tested coatings and penetrations, and other systems such as high purity breathing air and chemical decontamination showers that support BSL4 workers donning air pressure resistant suits. The HCCL's architectural character and massing will complement the finishes, textures, and colors of the adjacent Roybal Campus laboratory buildings. The Project includes utility infrastructure extensions necessary to connect the building to existing Roybal Campus utility systems with below grade utility tunnels for chilled water and steam services.</p>
<p>Phase I Solicitation<br />Phase I process requires the potential Offerors to submit their past performance and capability information, including Standard Form 330, for initial review and short-list selection of the Offerors that will be invited to participate in the Phase II Solicitation/Request for Proposal (RFP) by the Government.

<p>Selected prospective Offerors shall be required to possess the necessary permits, registrations and licenses that may be required to carry out all tasks covered under this contract.</p>
<p>Phase II Solicitation<br />Following the review, evaluation, and rating of the Phase I proposals, the Government will create a competitive range to select a maximum of three (3) highest rated Offerors to be considered for the Phase II Request for Proposals (RFP). During Phase II, a Solicitation including the detailed Statement of Work (SOW) and Project Development Study (PDS) will be issued to each firm selected from the Phase I submissions. The detailed selection criteria for Phase II will be provided with the Phase II Request for Proposal (RFP). Firms selected for Phase II will be provided a walking tour of the project site and possible tour of the existing facilities at the Roybal Campus.

<DESC>Good morning, 
This synopsis is posted to provide advanced notice that the VA intends to post a RFQ on or about 7/20/18 for janitorial services at the Marion Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC). 
This solicitation will be subject to the SCA WD for that county and will be posted within the RFQ s clause 52.212-5. 
This is a base plus two option period intended contract. The lease on the CBOC is going to end 9/30/19. It is currently the government s plan to move from this location at that time. That being stated, I have added the option years to allow for services to continue through any hold-over period that is expected in the location. 
I expect the base and first option period to be needed in full. The contract (from this synopsis/solicitation) intended will be terminated for convenience when the need for the services is no longer needed during the course of the contract.  
Additional information to follow with the RFQ. 

Thanks,

Luke Turner

<DESC>NSN 4820-00-326-7134. Item Description: Cock, Plug. Manufacturer's Code and Part Number: (77445) P/N 821230-01.

<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote, which shall be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 18 DEC 2017. The Small Business size standard is 1,250 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources is United Technologies Corporation (77445).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of the posting of this notice.</p>
<p>Various quantities solicited: 20-25, 26-30, 31-35, and 36-40.</p>

<p>- Encouraging agencies to improve their ability to plan and execute enforcement based on a data-driven approach of knowing where and when motor vehicle crashes and fatalities occur.</p>
<p>- Supporting States in organizing and conducting law enforcement-related events related to crackdowns and mobilizations at the State or local level.</p>
<p>- Obtaining, compiling, and organizing data for presentation to NHTSA.</p>

<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $15 Million.</p>
<p>Delivery is within 6 months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p>The NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics is conducting a Liver Cancer Pooling Project (LCPP) among the studies of the NCI Cohort Consortium. The LCPP was established to investigate, in a prospective fashion, the etiology of liver cancer in the United States. All U.S. based Cohort Consortium studies, including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), were invited to participate in the LCPP by donating serum samples and questionnaire data to a pooled analysis.</p>
<p>The WHI is a long-term national health study that has focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. The WHI, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, has 161,808 participants who were enrolled at 40 clinical centers nationwide. Participants were between the ages of 50 and 79 years at enrollment. The WHI has two major components: a randomized clinical trial and an observational study. The clinical trial arm enrolled 68,132 women into trials testing three prevention strategies: a hormone therapy trial, a dietary modification trial and a calcium/vitamin D trial. The observational study enrolled 93,676 women to examine the relationship between lifestyle, health, risk factors and specific disease outcomes. Recruitment for the observational study begun in 1993 and completed in 1998 and participants were followed for 8 to 12 years. The clinical trial component also enrolled participants between 1993 and 1998 and closed-out the interventions between 2004 and 2005. At close-out, the trial participants were invited to enroll in the WHI Extension Study which involved health tracking without intervention through 2010.</p>
<p>In 2011 and 2016 WHI provided the LCPP with samples from liver cancer cases and controls in order to examine the distribution of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus markers and to examine steroid hormone levels.</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement is to obtain additional serum from liver cancer cases and controls who are members of the WHI. These samples will be assayed to determine levels of metabolites and markers of bacterial translocation.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Pull 240 serum samples from storage. The samples will include serum samples from liver cancer cancer (n=120) and controls (n=120) and QC samples (n=24). The volume of the aliquot will be 275 uL and 375 uL. Daughter vials from most of the samples should exist from the time that samples were prepared for the LCPP in 2011.</p>
<p>&bull; If a daughter vial of 375 uL does not currently exist, the Contractor shall prepare a 375 uL aliquot from a parent vial.<br />&bull; The Contractor shall ship samples to the NCI Biorepository on 1050 Boyle Street, Frederick, Maryland 21702<br />&bull; When shipping samples, the Contractor shall include a complete listing of all serum samples included.</p>
<p>All residual specimens, and all data generated shall be the property of the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The WHI is a member of the LCPP and already provided data and samples to the Project. The project will link the previous data and lab results to the lab results that will be generated by the current acquisitions. As the WHI samples are under the custody of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, only the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center can provide the samples to the Project.</p>

By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.

<RESPDATE>030818

<CONTACT>Lower, Angela
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Water (OW), requires technical and administrative contractor support to span across OW's Immediate Office (IO), Office of Groundwater and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Office of Science and Technology (OST), Office of Wetlands, Oceans, and Watersheds (OWOW) and Office of Wastewater Management (OWM). This contract may also support the efforts of other EPA offices when activities intersect with OW Programs.   
Specific areas of support may include, but are not limited to:
	Technical Support
o	Cross-Cutting Activities
o	Administrative Record 
o	Data Collection and Analysis
o	Comment Response
o	Writing and Editing
o	Peer Review
o	Water Quality Models and Decision Support Tools
o	Expanded Authority Under the National Water Program

	Program Management and Operations Support
o	Facilitation
o	Strategic Planning 
o	LEAN Assessment and Coordination
o	Outreach
o	Communications
o	Translation Services
o	Event Planning and Logistics
o	Information Management 

Technical areas within the PWS will require quality assurance and/or quality control to fulfil EPA systematic planning for environmental information requirements. 
o	Data Quality Act 
o	Quality System Requirements
o	Customized Quality Management Plan
o	Quality Assurance Project Plans
o	Reporting Quality Assurance Progress

This procurement will be issued as Small Business Set Aside.  It is anticipated that the contract will be an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) multiple award contract with firm fixed price and cost plus fixed fee task orders with an ordering period of 5 years as a result of the solicitation.   The EPA intends to award up to four (4) contracts. The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $15 million in average annual receipts. As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (See FAR 52.219 14) under a procurement set aside for small businesses.  Additionally, interested parties are reminded that they must have an adequate cost accounting system or ability to implement an adequate cost accounting system required for a cost-type contract to receive an award.  

Significant potential exists for an organizational conflict of interest under this procurement. It is EPAs contention that a potential organizational COI may exist if award were to be made to firms within the following groups or to firms that have significant business or financial relationships with these firms: 
1)	Entities that are subject to or have financial interest through a contractual relationship with a firm subject to regulations directly related to EPA Water Programs. 

2)	Entities that own, operate or have a contractual relationship with clients that discharge processed water or wastewater, or provide treatment of wastewater or drinking water.  

3)	Entities that provide technical support as required for developing and approving water quality standards and criteria by designating the use or uses of water bodies, setting criteria necessary to protect the uses and preventing degradation of water quality.  

4)	Entities which are National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit holders or dischargers to NPDES dischargers. 

5)	Entities that manufacture, sell, import or have a contractual relationship with clients that are manufactures, sellers, or importers of water treatment chemicals or equipment (including point-of-use or point-of-entry treatment devices) b. Entities that manufacture, sell, import, or have a contractual relationship with clients that are chemical producers, importers of pesticides or agricultural products. c. Entities with direct involvement in, or that have a contractual relationship with clients in waste management or waste disposal that are discharged to waters of the United States. 

6)	Entities that provide advisory and/or technical services relating to waste minimization, waste management, and wastewater treatment and control.  

7)	Entities acting in a consulting, advisory, or legal capacity with, or for, organizations trying to overturn or circumvent EPA regulations or policies that may result from tasks issued under this contract. 

8)	Entities that own or operate industrial and/or community water systems.  

9)	Entities that are developers, suppliers, or manufacturers of pesticides, agricultural chemicals, or products indigenous to animal feed lot operations, regardless of size. 

10)	Entities that own, operate, or construct facilities or products which use water as a coolant for the absorption of heat, regardless of source or purpose, where those waters are not part of a closed system or reduced to steam; rather, once used, these waters are released, discharged, or otherwise returned to aquifers, ground water, or source waters to influence regulatory decision-making where it is perceived that EPA actions could negatively impact their financial interests.

The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) require an offeror certify that it is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or disclose any potential conflict of interest which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the solicitation.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after contract award will also be a part of the resultant solicitation.  

EPAAR 1552.209-74, Limitation of Future Contracting, also will be included in the resultant contract.  Under that clause, the contractor and any subcontractors will be ineligible to enter into business or financial relationships that would support or affect efforts to contest, oppose, or influence the content of regulations, policies, limitations, or standards related to the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act.  This restriction specifically applies, but is not limited to contracts for scientific, engineering, statistical, analytical, research, or data management services, without prior written authorization from the cognizant EPA CO.  This restriction shall be in effect during the life of the contract, and shall remain in effect for a period of three years after the completion of work under the contract.  The three-year period after contract completion, is justified, because regulatory development efforts typically require several years to complete. 

The solicitation is expected to be issued on or after September 17, 2018, and that proposals will be requested 30 days after issuance of the solicitation.  All responsible sources that submit a proposal will be considered by the agency.  A draft copy of the Performance Work Statement will be included as an attachment to the pre-solicitation notice and is subject to revisions.  The final Performance Work Statement, released with the solicitation, could differ from this attached draft version.  Contract award will be made in accordance with FAR PART 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The point of contact for this solicitation is Angela Lower, Contracting Officer, 26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, Mail Code: W122A, Cincinnati, OH 45268 who may be reached via email at lower.angela@epa.gov or via telephone at 513-487-2036.  A copy of the solicitation will be available on the FedConnect website.  All proposals will be required to be submitted on the FedConnect website. You must register with FedConnect to submit documents, questions, and to view responses. FedConnect can be accessed at https://www.fedconnect.net/Fedconnect/.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District will be issuing an Invitation for Bids for Maintenance Dredging of the Saco River Federal Navigation Project, Biddeford &amp; Saco, ME. This will be an unrestricted competitive solicitation requiring a hydraulic and mechanical dredge to perform the work. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The estimated construction cost is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a bid to be considered by the New England District.
<p>The proposed project consists of hydraulically dredging a portion of the Federal navigation project (FNP) at the mouth of the Saco River which includes an 8-foot deep entrance channel, and three 6-foot deep anchorages (below Mean Lower Low Water). Approximately 41,000 cubic yards (CY) of required dredging, with another 36,000 CY of 1-ft allowable over depth dredging would bring these areas back to their authorized dimensions. Sandy shoal material dredged from the mouth of the river will be pumped approximately 8,000 ft. north to Camp Ellis Beach. The work in this area will require significant coordination around the tide cycles.</p>
<p>Additionally a contract option to mechanically dredge a portion of the FNP's 8-foot deep channel, and 6-foot deep maneuvering basin at the city center of Saco is included. Approximately 22,000 CY of required, and another 13,000 CY of 1-ft allowable over depth of predominantly fine grain sand and silty shoal material will be completed by mechanical dredge and hauled 1.25 mile south to a previously used in-river placement site for disposal.</p>
<p>Dredging and disposal operations will be performed between November 15, 2018 and March 15, 2019 to meet environmental time of year (TOY) restrictions. In order to accomplish all dredging requirements within the specified dredging window the Government will include definitive responsibility criterion requiring the Contractor to demonstrate experience dredging at least a mean average of 28,000 cy in a 30-calendar day period via hydraulic dredge on at least one (1) project in a tidal-influence area in the last seven (7) years, and demonstrate successful completion of beach placement of sand material within an intertidal area within the last seven (7) years. Failure to meet these criterion will result in the low bidder being found not responsible, and award will be made to the next low bidder who is found to be responsive and responsible. The low bidder shall be asked to provide documentation of its ability to meet this definitive responsibility criterion via self-performance or acceptable business arrangement. Environmental coordination and permitting have been completed by the U.S. Army of Engineers, New England District.</p>
<p>This is not an invitation for bids at this time. The solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about Aug 10, 2017 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov). Please note this solicitation will be UNRESTRICTED. In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self-register their firm with federal Business Opportunities (go to http:/www.fbo.gov and register under Vendor/Citizen). Amendments, if any, to the solicitation will be made available at the http:/www/fbo.gov website. Neither telephonic, mailed nor fax requests will be accepted.

<div><br />&nbsp;
<p><strong>Summary of Scope of Work</strong></p>
<p>The USACE Walla Walla District has a requirement at the Division Works of the Mill Creek Project.  The existing needle gates are made of wooden slats laid vertically at an angle and secured in place against the road bridge.  There is currently an electrical conduit that is mounted under the bridge that passes through a hole in the needle gates.  An amount of silt and debris has accumulated in the basin downstream of the needle gates and accompanying radial gate.</p>
<p>The replacement effort involves removal and disposal offsite of the existing wooden slats, and removal and disposal offsite of up to 20 cubic yards of material from the downstream basin.   After the debris is removed, the banks immediately adjacent to the structure would be re-graded to 2:1 slope to prevent erosion.  Three new runs of electrical conduit will be installed under the road (approximately 60 feet), with one run being used to re-route the existing electrical power line that currently routes under the bridge.  The new electrical power line will be reconnected on both ends.</p>
<p>The needle gates will be replaced with three new precast concrete panels at one foot thick, one of which is no larger than 16 feet by 8 feet, the other two of which are no larger than 6 feet by 8 feet.  The panels will be lifted into place vertically and secured at top and bottom.  The larger panel will be grouted in place to create a watertight seal, while the smaller panels will have rubber seals.</p>
<p>A new painted steel bulkhead made of 3x3x1/4" HSS tubing and 1/4" skin plate will be fabricated and mounted between the two smaller concrete panels.  The steel bulkhead will be no larger than 5 feet by 8 feet, and will be painted with a vinyl paint system for submerged conditions.  The steel bulkhead will contain a combination sluice and weir gate, with the weir gate made of two telescoping leaves.  The seals and rub-blocks will be made of UHMW, and the combination sluice and weir gate will be made of stainless steel.  The combination gate will cover an opening no larger than 2 feet by 5 feet, and will have two manual bevel operators with hand-wheels, one to control the sluice section, and one to control the weir leaves.  The steel bulkhead with the assembled and mounted combination gate will be lifted into place vertically and secured at top and bottom and to the concrete panels on both sides.</p>
