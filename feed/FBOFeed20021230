Offerors who do not have same or similar past performance information reasonably available to the Contracting Officer will not be rated either favorable or unfavorable.

The information may be used to evaluate the Offeror's past performance in meeting costs/price, technical, delivery objectives and customer satisfaction.  The results may be used in the overall comparative evaluation of the offer in accordance with 52.212-2 and addendum.  52.212-2 Addendum: Evaluation: Paragraph (a)  Factor:  Past Performance and Price.

<DESC>This procurement is for the construction of two (2) waterfront fuel handling facilities that will transfer fuel to and from tankers berthed at Delta and Echo Piers respectively, to and from COMNAVMAR storage tanks located at Sasa Valley and Tenjo Valley, Guam, Mariana Islands.  More specifically, the subject project will provide three (3) 8-inch diameter mechanical fuel loading arms at Delta Pier and another three (3) 8-inch mechanical fuel loading arms at Echo Pier.  The work will include providing structural support to the loading arms, pier modifications, and piping connections to existing fuel manifold systems at each pier.  The work will include providing structural support to providing a micronic filter vessel rate at 150 psig in the JP-5 fuel handling system replacing extisting sump pumps, one at each pier.  Because the facilities to be provided are waterfront fuel handling facilities, qualified contractors must have prior experience with the installation of fuel related equipment/ systems/piping in highly corrosive salt water environments.  Also, since all welds provided under the subject project will be subjected to non-destructive testing and evaluation, qualified contractors must have this type of specialized experience.  This project is solicted unrestricted.  Source selection is considered the appropriate method for procuring this project because it provides the government with the ability to obtain a qualified contractor based on technical merit and price competition.  The Government intends to award this contract without discussions and will incorporate FAR 52.215-1 into the solicitation.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch, intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Timothy J. Jorgensen, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Department of Radiation Medicine, Lombardi Cancer Center, 3970 Reservoir Road, N.W., Washington, D.C.; services in support of the Development of a Biomarker for Skin Cancer Risk.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 621511 and the business size standard is $11.5M.  The purpose of this project is to support the pilot work to develop a biomarker for individual tumor susceptibility.  This will be used in epidemiologic studies of skin cancer in relation to exposure to ionizing radiation and ultraviolet radiation.  The Patched gene (PTCH) is a developmental gene, first identified in Drosophila, with widespread conservation among a variety of species, including humans.  During Stage I, first 6 months of study, the contractor shall prepare and insert a human PTCH-GFP construct similar to mouse PTCH-LacZ construct, along with a CMV-HcRed construct, into an expression vector system.  HcRed (BD Biosciences Clontech) is a far-red fluorescent protein.  The protein's coding sequence has been human codon optimized to improve its expression in mammalian cells.  Because it fluoresces in the far-red region of the spectrum, HcRed provides a very high signal-to-noise ration, virtually no cellular autofluorescence, and complete separation from the GFP signal.  During Stage II, months 7-12 of contract (depending on the results of the first 6 months, the contractor shall:  The reporter system will be tested in a panel of normal and tumor skin cell lines, since skin (basal) cells are the primary target tissue of interest.  Neither normal basal cell lines nor BCC tumor cell lines are readily available.  The contractor will also evaluate PTCH reporter vector in EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, since these are often the only viable cells that are available from study populations.  A comparison will be made from the results from skin cell lines with those from lymphoblasts, to determine how effective lymphoblasts are as a surrogate cell type for predicting PTCH functionality in skin.  Dr. Jorgensen's laboratory is the only known source to the Government as the particular type of biomarker being developed which was conceived by him, and thus is original and unable to be duplicated.  The contractor's radiation biology laboratory has a long standing interest in molecular mechanisms of radiation responses, and particularly in the proteins and genes that protect cells from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation.  The laboratory has focused exclusively on human cell systems and has studied a number of molecular markers thought to be important to radiation resistance and protection against radiation-induced cancer, including ATM, p53, and PTCH.  They also have experience in developing DNA repair assays that can be used on human leukocytes and in the use of flow cytometry for assay protection.  The contractor has expertise in radiation biology and oncology, demonstrated experience in identifying a number of molecular markers related to host susceptibility, and skills in developing DNA repair assays with added capability of using automated flow cytometry.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on January 6, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax on (301) 402-4513.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing Request for Proposals Number R-CHI-00677 in support of the HUD's Headquarters, Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), Affordable Housing Research and Technology Division      (AHRTD). Five (5) contracts are expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation to provide studies related to the HUD programs known as Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing (PATH). This procurement is being issued on a negotiated basis. The 5 contracts expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation will cover the following PATH categories and brief descriptions: PATH 9 - Creating Whole House System Solutions -----While many research and intellectual groups have loosely defined the concept of the 'whole house,' most of these have only suggested broad changes in the ways that individual home
building firms function and the home building industry is structured. The PATH Roadmap, however, has suggested the current industry must go beyond individual changes and into advancing wholistic approaches to designing, constructing, and maintaining homes, or systems thinking. This project will define both technically and contextually the technical and operations components of a whole house. This involves reviewing past      examples of whole house approaches, and assembling categories for the technological systems necessary to accomplish this concept. PATH 11 - Durability/Moisture: Applying System Solutions----- One of the goals of the Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing (PATH) is to increase the durability of housing while maintaining affordability. The presence of moisture is perhaps the most significant durability issue to be addressed in the design of homes.Moisture needs to be looked at as an aspect of the whole house and its construction as well. To approach this, a comprehensive plan shall be created as to how to coordinate research and other activities leading to better moisture resistance in single family housing that looks at the
whole house aspects of the problem. PATH 12 - Whole House Research: Disentangling Utilities----- New subsystems in housing-like indoor plumbing, electric wiring,central HVAC-have been simply "added to" the home rather than "integrated
into it. This problem has become critical as more systems are panelized; installing utility systems in conventional stud construction is awkward and often ends up compromising     structural or insulating integrity. This project focuses on how to integrate utilities into these building systems or disentangle them from these building systems to best achieve more      affordable housing. PATH 13 - Panel's Research I: Wall Panels Benchmark and Performance Requirements----- The broad purpose of this project is to define what panelized wall systems
are currently available and their technical specifications, how do they perform and in what applications are they most used, and what are the standard performance criteria that all panelized wall systems need to meet in order to integrate with existing methods of construction. This project involves reviewing all panelized wall systems currently on the market, assembling categories for the technical product specifications necessary to identify similarities and differences. After the literature review and analysis, a detailed study of the conflicting technical
performance attributes (e.g., structural performance vs. weight limitations vs. material durability, etc.) must be performed. Suggested parameters for these attributes will also be
developed. PATH 14 - Tools for Streamlining the Code Enforcement Documentation and Communication Process----- This project will examine the tools currently available to code enforcement offices, tools currently available in industries with similar requirements, and potential tools which could be developed for use by code enforcement offices to document their uses and potential. The solicitation package will provide additional information regarding the above PATH projects. This is a new acquisition. There are no current contractors performing this work under individual contracts nor historic data is available concerning these individual contracts nor any other PATH programs.-----This solicitation is total set aside for small business

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-BAA-03-04-IFKA
<CONTACT>IFKA ContractingOfficer, Contracting Officer, Phone 315/330-4767, Email IFKA@rl.af.mil
<DESC>AFRL Program Manager: Brian O'Hern, email ohern@rl.af.mil, 315/330-3995; Alternate: Jon S. Jones, e-mail Jon.Jones@rl.af.mil 315/330-1665; Technical Points of Contact: Steve Scott, email steve.scott@rl.af.mil, 315/330-4414; Contracting Officer, email IFKA@rl.af.mil.  The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Information and Intelligence Exploitation Division (AFRL/IFE) in cooperation with the Electronic Systems Center (ESC) is seeking innovative solutions for the reduction of risk associated with the development, deployment, and operation of a Space-Based Radar (SBR) System.  This SBR System consists of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) or Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite constellations with a multi-mode radar producing Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) products.  This SBR BMC3 Risk Reduction BAA will focus on the following technology areas: 1) Collection Management including dynamic tasking, 2) Information Management, and 3) Exploitation Products including GMTI, SAR imagery and Combat Identification.  This risk reduction effort will improve the SBR capability provided to the Warfighter in the form of an enhanced operational capability.    However, there is an inherent interdependency between all of the risk reduction areas.  Given the mission requirements and dynamic tasking from the user community, the SBR Collection Management system must rapidly prioritize, optimize and allocate tasks.  Commands are up-linked to the sensor constellation, which, in turn, downlinks sensor products. This includes radar modes for GMTI, SAR and High Range Resolution (HRR) for various areas, revisit times and resolutions and the resulting data products.  
In the area of Collection Management, developments allowing the dynamic retasking of a satellite sensor from theatre in a timely, assured, secure, and spacecraft vehicle safe manner are required.  This area will explore different conceptual architectures to satisfy national and tactical users for satellite sensor retasking and include timely status notification.  Objectives include defining the technical requirements for mission management and defining notional mission management architectures.  This includes a study of available applications for satellite retasking, SBR resource allocation techniques, and available applications suitable for use in satellite retasking, such as track waveform scheduling, track loss/stop verification, track restart with continuity of identification, interrupted imaging modes, etc.  Offerors must consider satellite orbits, handoffs, gap times, coverage areas, revisit times, resolution, sensor modes available, task prioritization, etc. and notification of reprioritized task list to all potential interested users.  In the area of Information Management (IM), support of BMC3 for SBR will be a critical factor for determining tactical Tasking, Posting, Processing, and Using (TPPU) alternatives, national Tasking, Collection, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination (TCPED) alternatives, and CONOPS alternatives system design tradeoffs.  This area will characterize IM technologies in terms of SBR BMC3 risk areas and summarize SBR requirements drivers for IM.   In particular, after performing ground processing, the SBR system of systems must archive (post), catalog, and facilitate rapid database query, and dissemination of information to the user community. Development of an integrated and interoperable architecture for theater and national information management is the goal.  This includes an assessment of technical requirements for this architecture, identification of technical deficiencies in data warehousing and data mining, and prototyping an implementation of national and tactical information management architectures and activities such as autonomous meta-data capture mechanisms, characterization of intelligent agents to process meta-data, and peer-to-peer mechanisms for information exchange.  Some consideration should be given to appropriate meta-data descriptors, such as pedigree, and data-derived products.  Once the data reaches the ground, the data processing (Product) area has been identified as high risk and requires additional technical development.  Current GMTI, SAR exploitation techniques are manual, operator intensive, based on single or multiple airborne sensor concepts, and very limited.  In the area of GMTI Exploitation, utilizing a satellite constellation with rapidly changing viewing angles and varying sensor performance attributes has not been fully explored, and therefore, requires development, testing, and analysis.  Furthermore, software must combine the data from these satellite sensors into meaningful products.  This area will develop the necessary extensions to current ground tracking algorithms to support the expected characteristics of a space-based radar constellation. Items of interest include extensions to existing capabilities and development of new feature-based classification approaches for SBR to support classification and track maintenance. Particular attention will be focused on developing algorithms and analyses for the use of selected feature data such as High Range Resolution (HRR), Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR), and Micro-Doppler techniques to perform long-term track maintenance. The satellites will be tasked to collect GMTI, SAR, and DTED data, requiring additional development in exploitation tools for utilization.  The large quantities of data sent to the exploitation center can potentially be overwhelming.   The combination of these technologies will provide a powerful tool set for operators to exploit SBR products and will enable the creation of a more comprehensive picture of the Battlespace.  Space assets provide a new foundation in that they provide consistent coverage of hostile target areas over a continuous 24 hour cycle. This provides for normalization to be developed over the movement patterns associated with normal operations.  These areas encompass the entire cycle for tactical SBR tasking, posting, processing, using (TPPU) and national tasking, collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination (TCPED).  Development in these areas will not only mature component technical capability, but will also evolve the community?s understanding of the entire, integrated, system-of-systems operation.  Efforts under this BAA will provide algorithms to enable the optimal fusion of resources for the timely detection, track, and identification of ground moving targets. There are currently more targets than resources in any Concept of Operation so that adequate optimization of resources (constellation, platforms, and sensors) is critical to engaging moving vehicles.   These efforts will also leverage existing developments in the operational area such as Moving Target Information Exploitation (MTIX) and develop on those architectures making it easily adaptable to existing architectures for technology transition. From all aspects of information fusion technology, SBR Measures of Performance (MOPs) and Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) need to be developed and integrated into these new concepts. This will provide the methodology for consistent system evaluation.  THIS ANNOUCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a one-sided, 12 point type, single spaced, one inch margined white paper not to exceed ten (10) pages with a cover letter.

Note:   Criteria 1 through 3 are of equal importance and Criteria 1 through 3 are more important than Criteria 4. Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA will be used. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  The cost of preparing proposals in responding to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract, but it is an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.   Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the SECRET level; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for, or eligible for, access to SECRET information. In addition, the offeror must have or have access to a certified and Government-approved facility available to support work under this BAA.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, AFRL/IFKA, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514, email: AFRL/IFKA@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.
This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 04.  Principal funding of this BAA and anticipated awards will start approximately March of 2003. Individual awards will not normally exceed 18 months in duration, with dollar amounts normally ranging from $200K to $1.0M. Total funding for FY03 is $3M with an estimated total ceiling of $15.0M in anticipation of projected increases in support from AFRL Customers. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY03 ? 15Jan 03; FY04 - 30Jun03, and; FY05 - 30Jun04.

The areas that will be targeted include: building repairs, roofing, paving, painting, plumbing, pipefitting, heating, fire alarms, air conditioning, locksmith services, elevator maintenance, electrical, glasswork, demolition and facility operations.  This is a representative list and should not be considered exhaustive of all services that will be in the initiative.  The initial implementation was awarded in September 2001 for the Northeast Region of the United States.  This roll out region's, defined as the Southwest Region of the Continental United States (CONUS), target audience will include military bases and all other DoD and Federal agencies in the states if Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, and Utah.  Prospective contractors should be able to adequately support services that will range from a minimum of $10,000.00 to a maximum potential of $100 million annually. The maximum dollar value is contingent on the number of facilities and the extent of the participation of those facilities at any given time. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 235990, facilities maintenance services. Subject solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contracts being firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, and indefinite quantity. One of the resultant contracts will be reserved for a small business provided that at least two responsible small business concerns will submit competitive proposals under this solicitation. The performance period will be for five years, including a two-year base period with three (3) one-year term options.  This will be a best value source selection acquisition in which technical merit is considered more important than price. Oral presentations will be a part of the technical evaluation. All information submitted is at the offeror's expense. The Government is not responsible for any aspect of transportation to or from the location for the oral presentation.  Solicitation number SP0500-03-R-0030 will be issued around JAN 28, 2003 with an estimated closing date of FEB 28, 2003.  The exact date will be stipulated on the solicitation.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 001 The purpose of this amendment is to accomplish the following: 1.	Answer vendor submitted questions. 2.	Delete requirement from specification that states all vendors must be ISO9001 certified. 3.	Extend the date quotations are due. This amendment incorporates the following: 1.	Following are questions submitted by vendor.  The Government has provided the following answers: 1) Item 3.3-"fully compensated" means that the pump is compensated back to no flow at maximum normal operating pressure. Please verify. Answer:  Yes. 2) Item 3.18- "operate to the noise specification at full output without need for a pump room or enclosure". ? regarding the meaning of full output; full output of pressure at no flow as defined in item 1 above, which is standard interpretation or  does this mean full pressure and flow output?   Answer:  The goal is to provide a u nit, that when in a max load condition, meets the “quietness” spec.    3) Item 3.19.3- "designed specifically to be used with servohydraulic test equipment" Can this be defined regarding a flow or pressure varialtion allowed? And "transmit excessive vibrations so that the servohydraulic test machine will be affected" ? Does this mean affected due to the pressure and flow variation in the pump or is the pumping unit going to be attached to the servohydraulic test machine mechanically and the requirement is to reduce the vibration transmitted to the test apparatus due to this connection?   Answer:  The goal is to provide hydraulic isolation, as opposed to mechanical isolation.  The HPU is to be used as a stand-alone supply.  It is to be used with a seismically-isolated missile flight motion table.  4)Item 4.5 "HPU must have accommodations for the following add-on options.. ." ? regarding accommodations. Can this be defined? Should there just be room and/or structure allowed to add these options or should there be valving and fittings for the easier addition of these options?   Answer:  There should be valving and fittings for the easier addition of these options. 5) Item 4.6.1 "HPU must incorporate a control feature to enable remote: start/stop, high/low pressure and basic fault indication" ? Does this mean a remote, mountable electric box that can accomplish these functions in addition to accomplishing these functions on the power unit itself , or would the remote unit be the only location that would accomplish these functions?   Answer:  We require both sets of controls.                 6) Item 4.7 "Commoning hardware shall be included (connecting to two power u nits to provide increased flow)" ? Can this be more specific? Would capped off piping be adequate or would some kind of valves be required and, if so, would they have to be electrically or manually actuated?   Answer:  Valves shall be utilized.  The valve type is not specified. 2.	Delete the Bid Specification requirement at paragraph 1.4 stating “To ensure consistent quality all vendors must be ISO 9001 certified.”. 3.	The date quotations are due is extended, from 27 December 2002, 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time to 3 January 2003, 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.

Because this contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000.00, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns.  The small disadvantaged business goal in that subcontracting plan shall not be less than 5% of the subcontracted work.  This goal of not less than 5% also applies to women-owned small business concerns.  A subcontracting plan is not required from firms classified as a small business.  Effective 1 October 1997, A/E contractors are now required to register their firms in the Central Contractor Registration database prior to receiving a contract award.  This database provides basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government and complies with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which requires Federal agencies to have the Taxpayer Identification Number of every contractor and to pay every contractor through electronic funds transfer.  A/E contractors will only have to provide this information once with annual updates or as key company information changes occur.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.acq.mil/ec; through any DOD Certified Value Added Network; or a paper may be obtained by calling the DOD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414.   Provide SF 254 and SF 255 packages to: Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Engineering Field Activity Chesapeake (Attn: Code CH2A - Randolph Jones), Washington Navy Yard, Building 212, 1314 Harwood St., SE, Washington, DC 20374-5018.

<SUBJECT>70--SiteScape Enterprise Forum
<DESC>The Bureau of the Census intends to negotiate a single source contract with Sitescape Inc. of Maynard, MA for the following: 1 ea.  SiteScape Enterprise Forum Server with Solaris Kit; 200 ea. SiteScape Enterprise Forum License V7; 1 yr. Premium Maintenance/Support; 3 days Administrators, 1 day (on-site) Customization Training.  This software is currently being used at Census for external collaboration with the following functionality: portlet available for Oracle portals (Oracle and SiteScape are partners); supports Oracle databases as well as legacy databases; browser-based interface; provides a summary page upon authentication including all authorized workspaces, new entries, and a list of team members online for discussions; organized threaded discussions; real-time chat; Web file system; canned and customizable workflow processing and document sharing and co-authoring with automatic version control. In particular, the ability to perform workflow processing and document version control are key selection criteria.  Workflow control allows for the ability to monitor changes in documents and/or tasks over the course of a project.  The document version control allows the participants in the project to see and discuss the evolution of changes to documents, through this system, over the life of the project.  These two capabilities allow for archival handling, a feature that is important in providing benchmarks over the course of the project. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, a partnering agency, has also invested in SiteScape software.  Their procurement of this software has enabled the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Justice Statistics employees to collaborate about interagency projects from their respective locations.  Purchasing additional SiteScape software licenses will provide a consistent user experience for collaboration and result in significantly lower costs for training and product support.  This is not a request for competitive proposals; however, responses received within the required time will be reviewed and evaluated.  Interested companies having the capability to provide the above described services should submit, in writing, their capability statement with cost information to Linda Vance, email: linda.a.vance@census.gov or fax: 301-457-8465 within 15 days of this notice.  No telephone requests will be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice; but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no responses are received within 15 days from the date of this notice, a sole source contract will be awarded to Sitescape Inc. without further notice.

<SUBJECT>X -- U.S. GOVERNMENT SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT, MADISON, WI
<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT, MADISON, WI. As required by 41 U.S.C. 253(f), this serves to provide notice that the U.S. Government intends to negotiate a sole source procurement for a succeeding lease of approximately 9,700 usable square feet of office and related space at 545 Zor Shrine Place, Madison, WI. A new lease contract will be created to reflect a 10-year, 5-year firm term. This project is required as the need for this space is based on the Government's ability to continue to do business, without disruption, at this location. As relocating would incur substantial moving costs including, but not limited to, systems furniture expenses, information systems costs for equipment upgrades, wiring, installation and setup, physical moving expenses, tenant improvement expenses and contractor costs, it has been determined that it is economically advantageous to have them remain at the current location.

<DESC>NOTICE TO VENDORS with Active Ames Research Center (ARC) Active Contracts and Purchase Orders: (The following letter was distributed on December 12, 2002) Dear NASA Vendor: Ames Research Center will be shutting down its financial systems in early January to cut over to a new integrated financial management system.  The shut down may result in some payment delays.  Our records indicate your firm has an active contract or purchase order with Ames Research Center and consequently may be impacted. This cutover is part of a NASA-wide effort to modernize its financial and administrative systems and processes. This effort, the Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP), is implementing a series of new enterprise software systems and business processes in the form of module projects that will help improve employee productivity and operations efficiency, and also increase NASA’s fiscal and management accountability by delivering more reliable information. As part of our cut over preparation activities we are making every effort to ensure that all invoices received, for goods and services received by NASA-ARC, before January 3, 2003, will be paid before we shut down our systems. (NASA-ARC cannot honor invoices requesting advance payment for goods and services to be received during this transition period.)  During the down time we will not be able to make any payments until we come up under the new system which is anticipated to be late February. The Prompt Payment clause in your contract discusses the provisions for paying interest if payment is not made by its due date.  Please consult the clause for applicability of interest penalty payments for your specific contract.  The interest penalty is paid automatically, without a request from the Contractor.	The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.	The current interest rate is 5.25%.  If you have specific questions about the prompt payment clause in your contract please contact your Contracting Officer. We apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your patience and support as we make this transition Sincerely, Dolores M. Morrison Acting Procurement Officer
